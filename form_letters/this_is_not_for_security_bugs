Hi,

This is the semi-friendly bot of the kernel CVE assignment team.  I've detected
that you have sent a message that is not applicable for us to handle for the
following reason(s):

	- This list, as per our documentation, is ONLY for assigning CVEs to
	  existing kernel fixes that have been accepted into Linus's kernel
	  tree.  You are reporting a potential bug in the kernel that is NOT
	  resolved, and so, this is NOT the place to do so.  Please read the
	  kernel file Documentation/process/security_process.rst for who to
	  contact about potential security bugs.

Sincerely,

Linux CVE team's bot
