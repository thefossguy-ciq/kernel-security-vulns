Hi,

This is the semi-friendly bot of the kernel CVE assignment team.  I've
detected that you have sent a message that is not applicable for us to
handle for the following reason(s):

	- This alias, as per our documentation, is ONLY for assigning
	  CVEs for potential issues in the Linux kernel, it is NOT for
	  reporting potential bugs in the Linux kernel.  Please read the
	  file Documentation/process/security_process.rst in the Linux
	  kernel source tree for who to contact about potential security
	  bugs.

	- You are writing asking for a CVE assignment for an issue that
	  we have previously determined does not require such an
	  assignment.  If you dispute this resolution, please see the
	  documentation at:
		  https://www.cve.org/Resources/General/Policies/CVE-Record-Dispute-Policy.pdf
	  for how to properly start this process.

	- It seems that you are writing a message to dispute the
	  information in one, or more, of the CVE identifiers that we
	  have assigned to the kernel, yet you failed to properly
	  document your rationale for the dispute.  To correctly do
	  this, please follow the documentation at:
		  https://www.cve.org/Resources/General/Policies/CVE-Record-Dispute-Policy.pdf
	  and send us an email with the requested information to start
	  the process.

Sincerely,

Linux CVE team's email bot
