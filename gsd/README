This is a collection of the "raw" data that was submitted to the GSD project
(https://gsd.id/) for the kernel for many years.

It was submitted in csv format:
	GIT_ID_VULNERABLE,VERSION_VULNERABLE,GIT_ID_FIXED,VERSION_FIXED

Note, the GIT_ID_* values are references to the stable.git branches, the "root"
fix should be looked up in the mainline branch.
