In ar5523_probe(), ar5523_host_available() calls ar5523_cmd() as below
(there are other functions which finally call ar5523_cmd()):

ar5523_probe()
-> ar5523_host_available()
   -> ar5523_cmd_read()
      -> ar5523_cmd()

If ar5523_cmd() timed out, then ar5523_host_available() failed and
ar5523_probe() freed the device structure.  So, ar5523_cmd_tx_cb()
might touch the freed structure.

This patch fixes this issue by canceling in-flight tx cmd if submitted
urb timed out.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50716 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
