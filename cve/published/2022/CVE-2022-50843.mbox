Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm clone: Fix UAF in clone_dtr()

Dm_clone also has the same UAF problem when dm_resume()
and dm_destroy() are concurrent.

Therefore, cancelling timer again in clone_dtr().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50843 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
