Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: bcm: rpi: Prevent out-of-bounds access

The while loop in raspberrypi_discover_clocks() relies on the assumption
that the id of the last clock element is zero. Because this data comes
from the Videocore firmware and it doesn't guarantuee such a behavior
this could lead to out-of-bounds access. So fix this by providing
a sentinel element.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49946 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
