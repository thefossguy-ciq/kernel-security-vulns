Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wwan_hwsim: fix possible memory leak in wwan_hwsim_dev_new()

Inject fault while probing module, if device_register() fails,
but the refcount of kobject is not decreased to 0, the name
allocated in dev_set_name() is leaked. Fix this by calling
put_device(), so that name can be freed in callback function
kobject_cleanup().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50c31fa952309536c6e4461ff815ddccc8dff9d5
