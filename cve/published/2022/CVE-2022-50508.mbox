Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt76x0: fix oob access in mt76x0_phy_get_target_power

After 'commit ba45841ca5eb ("wifi: mt76: mt76x02: simplify struct
mt76x02_rate_power")', mt76x02 relies on ht[0-7] rate_power data for
vht mcs{0,7}, while it uses vth[0-1] rate_power for vht mcs {8,9}.
Fix a possible out-of-bound access in mt76x0_phy_get_target_power routine.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50508 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
