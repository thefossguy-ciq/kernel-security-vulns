Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netsec: fix error handling in netsec_register_mdio()

If phy_device_register() fails, phy_device_free() need be called to
put refcount, so memory of phy device and device name can be freed
in callback function.

If get_phy_device() fails, mdiobus_unregister() need be called,
or it will cause warning in mdiobus_free() and kobject is leaked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50624 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
