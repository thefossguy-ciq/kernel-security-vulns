Subject: CVE-2022-50477: rtc: class: Fix potential memleak in devm_rtc_allocate_device()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: class: Fix potential memleak in devm_rtc_allocate_device()

devm_rtc_allocate_device() will alloc a rtc_device first, and then run
dev_set_name(). If dev_set_name() failed, the rtc_device will memleak.
Move devm_add_action_or_reset() in front of dev_set_name() to prevent
memleak.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
