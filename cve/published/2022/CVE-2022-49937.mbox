Subject: CVE-2022-49937: media: mceusb: Use new usb_control_msg_*() routines

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mceusb: Use new usb_control_msg_*() routines

Automatic kernel fuzzing led to a WARN about invalid pipe direction in
the mceusb driver:

------------[ cut here ]------------

The reason for the warning is clear enough; the driver sends an
unusual read request on endpoint 0 but does not set the USB_DIR_IN bit
in the bRequestType field.

More importantly, the whole situation can be avoided and the driver
simplified by converting it over to the relatively new
usb_control_msg_recv() and usb_control_msg_send() routines.  That's
what this fix does.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49937 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
