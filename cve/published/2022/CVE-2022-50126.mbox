Subject: CVE-2022-50126: jbd2: fix assertion 'jh->b_frozen_data == NULL' failure when journal aborted

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: fix assertion 'jh->b_frozen_data == NULL' failure when journal aborted

Following process will fail assertion 'jh->b_frozen_data == NULL' in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata():

                   jbd2_journal_commit_transaction
unlink(dir/a)
 jh->b_transaction = trans1
 jh->b_jlist = BJ_Metadata
                    journal->j_running_transaction = NULL
                    trans1->t_state = T_COMMIT
unlink(dir/b)
 handle->h_trans = trans2
 do_get_write_access
  jh->b_modified = 0
  jh->b_frozen_data = frozen_buffer
  jh->b_next_transaction = trans2
 jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata
  is_handle_aborted
   is_journal_aborted // return false

           --> jbd2 abort <--

                     while (commit_transaction->t_buffers)
                      if (is_journal_aborted)
                       jbd2_journal_refile_buffer
                        __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer
                         WRITE_ONCE(jh->b_transaction,
						jh->b_next_transaction)
                         WRITE_ONCE(jh->b_next_transaction, NULL)
                         __jbd2_journal_file_buffer(jh, BJ_Reserved)
        J_ASSERT_JH(jh, jh->b_frozen_data == NULL) // assertion failure !

The reproducer (See detail in [Link]) reports:

After journal aborting, __jbd2_journal_refile_buffer() is executed with
holding @jh->b_state_lock, we can fix it by moving 'is_handle_aborted()'
into the area protected by @jh->b_state_lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50126 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
