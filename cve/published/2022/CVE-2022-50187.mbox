Subject: CVE-2022-50187: ath11k: fix netdev open race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath11k: fix netdev open race

Make sure to allocate resources needed before registering the device.

This specifically avoids having a racing open() trigger a BUG_ON() in
mod_timer() when ath11k_mac_op_start() is called before the
mon_reap_timer as been set up.

I did not see this issue with next-20220310, but I hit it on every probe
with next-20220511. Perhaps some timing changed in between.

Here's the backtrace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
