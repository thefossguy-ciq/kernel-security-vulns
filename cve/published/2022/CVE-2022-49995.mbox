Subject: CVE-2022-49995: writeback: avoid use-after-free after removing device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

writeback: avoid use-after-free after removing device

When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister gets called to stop further
writeback and wait for associated delayed work to complete.  However,
wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation dwork after
this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the
just freed bdi_writeback.

Fix this by checking if the bdi_writeback is alive, similar to when
scheduling writeback work.

Since this requires wb->work_lock, and wb_inode_writeback_end() may get
called from interrupt, switch wb->work_lock to an irqsafe lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
