We don't have a NULL check on file_ptr in io_msg_send_fd() function,
so when file_ptr is NUL src_file is also NULL and get_file()
dereferences a NULL pointer and leads to above crash.

Add a NULL check to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0163e04ea64cc3dfaa12390286e5f2f481c3b2e3
