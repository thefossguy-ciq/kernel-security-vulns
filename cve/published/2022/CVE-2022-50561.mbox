Subject: CVE-2022-50561: iio: fix memory leak in iio_device_register_eventset()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: fix memory leak in iio_device_register_eventset()

When iio_device_register_sysfs_group() returns failed,
iio_device_register_eventset() needs to free attrs array.

Otherwise, kmemleak would scan & report memory leak as below:

unreferenced object 0xffff88810a1cc3c0 (size 32):
  comm "100-i2c-vcnl302", pid 728, jiffies 4295052307 (age 156.027s)
  backtrace:
    __kmalloc+0x46/0x1b0
    iio_device_register_eventset at drivers/iio/industrialio-event.c:541
    __iio_device_register at drivers/iio/industrialio-core.c:1959
    __devm_iio_device_register at drivers/iio/industrialio-core.c:2040

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50561 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
