Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: megachips: Fix a null pointer dereference bug

When removing the module we will get the following warning:

[   31.911505] i2c-core: driver [stdp2690-ge-b850v3-fw] unregistered
[   31.912484] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000001: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
[   31.913338] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000008-0x000000000000000f]
[   31.915280] RIP: 0010:drm_bridge_remove+0x97/0x130
[   31.921825] Call Trace:
[   31.922533]  stdp4028_ge_b850v3_fw_remove+0x34/0x60 [megachips_stdpxxxx_ge_b850v3_fw]
[   31.923139]  i2c_device_remove+0x181/0x1f0

The two bridges (stdp2690, stdp4028) do not probe at the same time, so
the driver does not call ge_b850v3_resgiter() when probing, causing the
driver to try to remove the object that has not been initialized.

Fix this by checking whether both the bridges are probed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50317 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
