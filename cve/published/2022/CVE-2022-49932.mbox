Subject: CVE-2022-49932: KVM: VMX: Do _all_ initialization before exposing /dev/kvm to userspace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Do _all_ initialization before exposing /dev/kvm to userspace

Call kvm_init() only after _all_ setup is complete, as kvm_init() exposes
/dev/kvm to userspace and thus allows userspace to create VMs (and call
other ioctls).  E.g. KVM will encounter a NULL pointer when attempting to
add a vCPU to the per-CPU loaded_vmcss_on_cpu list if userspace is able to
create a VM before vmx_init() configures said list.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e136e969d268b9b89329c816c002e53f60e82985
