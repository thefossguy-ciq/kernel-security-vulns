Subject: CVE-2022-49885: ACPI: APEI: Fix integer overflow in ghes_estatus_pool_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: APEI: Fix integer overflow in ghes_estatus_pool_init()

Change num_ghes from int to unsigned int, preventing an overflow
and causing subsequent vmalloc() to fail.

The overflow happens in ghes_estatus_pool_init() when calculating
len during execution of the statement below as both multiplication
operands here are signed int:

len += (num_ghes * GHES_ESOURCE_PREALLOC_MAX_SIZE);

The following call trace is observed because of this bug:

[    9.317108] swapper/0: vmalloc error: size 18446744071562596352, exceeds total pages, mode:0xcc0(GFP_KERNEL), nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0-1

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
