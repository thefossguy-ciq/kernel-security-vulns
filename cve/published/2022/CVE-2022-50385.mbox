Subject: CVE-2022-50385: NFS: Fix an Oops in nfs_d_automount()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix an Oops in nfs_d_automount()

When mounting from a NFSv4 referral, path->dentry can end up being a
negative dentry, so derive the struct nfs_server from the dentry
itself instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50385 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
