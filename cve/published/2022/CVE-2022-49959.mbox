Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

openvswitch: fix memory leak at failed datapath creation

ovs_dp_cmd_new()->ovs_dp_change()->ovs_dp_set_upcall_portids()
allocates array via kmalloc.
If for some reason new_vport() fails during ovs_dp_cmd_new()
dp->upcall_portids must be freed.
Add missing kfree.

Kmemleak example:
unreferenced object 0xffff88800c382500 (size 64):
  comm "dump_state", pid 323, jiffies 4294955418 (age 104.347s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
