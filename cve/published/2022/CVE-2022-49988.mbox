Subject: CVE-2022-49988: binder_alloc: add missing mmap_lock calls when using the VMA

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder_alloc: add missing mmap_lock calls when using the VMA

Take the mmap_read_lock() when using the VMA in binder_alloc_print_pages()
and when checking for a VMA in binder_alloc_new_buf_locked().

It is worth noting binder_alloc_new_buf_locked() drops the VMA read lock
after it verifies a VMA exists, but may be taken again deeper in the call
stack, if necessary.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
