Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rapidio: fix possible name leaks when rio_add_device() fails

Patch series "rapidio: fix three possible memory leaks".

This patchset fixes three name leaks in error handling.
 - patch #1 fixes two name leaks while rio_add_device() fails.
 - patch #2 fixes a name leak while  rio_register_mport() fails.


This patch (of 2):

If rio_add_device() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name()
need be freed.  It should use put_device() to give up the reference in the
error path, so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(), and the
'rdev' can be freed in rio_release_dev().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50343 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
