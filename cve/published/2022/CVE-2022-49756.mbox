Subject: CVE-2022-49756: phy: usb: sunplus: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in sp_usb_phy_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: usb: sunplus: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in sp_usb_phy_probe()

sp_usb_phy_probe() will call platform_get_resource_byname() that may fail
and return NULL. devm_ioremap() will use usbphy->moon4_res_mem->start as
input, which may causes null-ptr-deref. Check the ret value of
platform_get_resource_byname() to avoid the null-ptr-deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49756 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d838b5c99bcecd593b4710a93fce8fdbf122395b
