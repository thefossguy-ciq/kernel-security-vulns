Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: replace WARN_ONs by nilfs_error for checkpoint acquisition failure

If creation or finalization of a checkpoint fails due to anomalies in the
checkpoint metadata on disk, a kernel warning is generated.

This patch replaces the WARN_ONs by nilfs_error, so that a kernel, booted
with panic_on_warn, does not panic.  A nilfs_error is appropriate here to
handle the abnormal filesystem condition.

This also replaces the detected error codes with an I/O error so that
neither of the internal error codes is returned to callers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50519 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
