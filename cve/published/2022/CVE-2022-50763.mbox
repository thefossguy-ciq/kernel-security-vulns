Subject: CVE-2022-50763: crypto: marvell/octeontx - prevent integer overflows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: marvell/octeontx - prevent integer overflows

The "code_length" value comes from the firmware file.  If your firmware
is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to
protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible.
Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and
prints warnings if it not capped correctly.

The "code_length * 2" can overflow.  The round_up(ucode_size, 16) +
sizeof() expression can overflow too.  Prevent these overflows.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50763 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
