Subject: CVE-2022-50022: drivers:md:fix a potential use-after-free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers:md:fix a potential use-after-free bug

In line 2884, "raid5_release_stripe(sh);" drops the reference to sh and
may cause sh to be released. However, sh is subsequently used in lines
2886 "if (sh->batch_head && sh != sh->batch_head)". This may result in an
use-after-free bug.

It can be fixed by moving "raid5_release_stripe(sh);" to the bottom of
the function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50022 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
