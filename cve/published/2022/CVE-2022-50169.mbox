Subject: CVE-2022-50169: wifi: wil6210: debugfs: fix info leak in wil_write_file_wmi()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wil6210: debugfs: fix info leak in wil_write_file_wmi()

The simple_write_to_buffer() function will succeed if even a single
byte is initialized.  However, we need to initialize the whole buffer
to prevent information leaks.  Just use memdup_user().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50169 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
