Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: null_blk: end timed out poll request

When poll request is timed out, it is removed from the poll list,
but not completed, so the request is leaked, and never get chance
to complete.

Fix the issue by ending it in timeout handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49057 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/407d09a22f3f685fd634aa5d05840c64b23bfebc
