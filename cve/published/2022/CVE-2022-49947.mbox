Subject: CVE-2022-49947: binder: fix alloc->vma_vm_mm null-ptr dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix alloc->vma_vm_mm null-ptr dereference

Syzbot reported a couple issues introduced by commit 44e602b4e52f
("binder_alloc: add missing mmap_lock calls when using the VMA"), in
which we attempt to acquire the mmap_lock when alloc->vma_vm_mm has not
been initialized yet.

This can happen if a binder_proc receives a transaction without having
previously called mmap() to setup the binder_proc->alloc space in [1].
Also, a similar issue occurs via binder_alloc_print_pages() when we try
to dump the debugfs binder stats file in [2].

  ==================================================================

Fix these issues by setting up alloc->vma_vm_mm pointer during open()
and caching directly from current->mm. This guarantees we have a valid
reference to take the mmap_lock during scenarios described above.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81203ab7a6ef843a2b904a0a494f28c457d44d27
