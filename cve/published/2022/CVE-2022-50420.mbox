Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/hpre - fix resource leak in remove process

In hpre_remove(), when the disable operation of qm sriov failed,
the following logic should continue to be executed to release the
remaining resources that have been allocated, instead of returning
directly, otherwise there will be resource leakage.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50420 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
