Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: ops: Fix bounds check for _sx controls

For _sx controls the semantics of the max field is not the usual one, max
is the number of steps rather than the maximum value. This means that our
check in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx() needs to just check against the maximum
value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
