Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

chardev: fix error handling in cdev_device_add()

While doing fault injection test, I got the following report:

------------[ cut here ]------------
kobject: '(null)' (0000000039956980): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.
WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 6306 at kobject_put+0x23d/0x4e0
CPU: 3 PID: 6306 Comm: 283 Tainted: G        W          6.1.0-rc2-00005-g307c1086d7c9 #1253
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014
RIP: 0010:kobject_put+0x23d/0x4e0
Call Trace:

 i2c_device_probe+0xa81/0xc00

When device_add() is injected fault and returns error, if dev->devt is not set,
cdev_add() is not called, cdev_del() is not needed. Fix this by checking dev->devt
in error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50282 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
