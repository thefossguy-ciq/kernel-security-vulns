Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Fix kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrupt

Fix the following kernel oops in btmtksdio_interrrupt

[   14.339134]  btmtksdio_interrupt+0x28/0x54
[   14.339139]  process_sdio_pending_irqs+0x68/0x1a0
[   14.339144]  sdio_irq_work+0x40/0x70
[   14.339154]  process_one_work+0x184/0x39c
[   14.339160]  worker_thread+0x228/0x3e8
[   14.339168]  kthread+0x148/0x3ac
[   14.339176]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x30

That happened because hdev->power_on is already called before
sdio_set_drvdata which btmtksdio_interrupt handler relies on is not
properly set up.

The details are shown as the below: hci_register_dev would run
queue_work(hdev->req_workqueue, &hdev->power_on) as WQ_HIGHPRI
workqueue_struct to complete the power-on sequeunce and thus hci_power_on
may run before sdio_set_drvdata is done in btmtksdio_probe.

The hci_dev_do_open in hci_power_on would initialize the device and enable
the interrupt and thus it is possible that btmtksdio_interrupt is being
called right before sdio_set_drvdata is filled out.

When btmtksdio_interrupt is being called and sdio_set_drvdata is not filled
, the kernel oops is going to happen because btmtksdio_interrupt access an
uninitialized pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49200 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
