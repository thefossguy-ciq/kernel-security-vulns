Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix crash due to out of bounds access into reg2btf_ids.

When commit e6ac2450d6de ("bpf: Support bpf program calling kernel function") added
kfunc support, it defined reg2btf_ids as a cheap way to translate the verifier
reg type to the appropriate btf_vmlinux BTF ID, however
commit c25b2ae13603 ("bpf: Replace PTR_TO_XXX_OR_NULL with PTR_TO_XXX | PTR_MAYBE_NULL")
moved the __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX from the last member of bpf_reg_type enum to after
the base register types, and defined other variants using type flag
composition. However, now, the direct usage of reg->type to index into
reg2btf_ids may no longer fall into __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX range, and hence lead to
out of bounds access and kernel crash on dereference of bad pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
