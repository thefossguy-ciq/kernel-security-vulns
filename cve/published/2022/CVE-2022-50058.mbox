Subject: CVE-2022-50058: vdpa_sim_blk: set number of address spaces and virtqueue groups

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa_sim_blk: set number of address spaces and virtqueue groups

Commit bda324fd037a ("vdpasim: control virtqueue support") added two
new fields (nas, ngroups) to vdpasim_dev_attr, but we forgot to
initialize them for vdpa_sim_blk.

When creating a new vdpa_sim_blk device this causes the kernel
to panic in this way:
    $ vdpa dev add mgmtdev vdpasim_blk name blk0
    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030
    ...
    RIP: 0010:vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx+0x41/0x220 [vhost_iotlb]
    ...
    Call Trace:
     <TASK>
     vhost_iotlb_add_range+0x11/0x800 [vhost_iotlb]
     vdpasim_map_range+0x91/0xd0 [vdpa_sim]
     vdpasim_alloc_coherent+0x56/0x90 [vdpa_sim]
     ...

This happens because vdpasim->iommu[0] is not initialized when
dev_attr.nas is 0.

Let's fix this issue by initializing both (nas, ngroups) to 1 for
vdpa_sim_blk.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a291c7d289fac2cb13fb2614a9a251afbbd86ce9
