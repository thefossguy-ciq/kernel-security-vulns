Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: usbtmc: Fix bug in pipe direction for control transfers

The syzbot fuzzer reported a minor bug in the usbtmc driver:

usb 5-1: BOGUS control dir, pipe 80001e80 doesn't match bRequestType 0
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 3813 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:412

Call Trace:

 usb_control_msg+0x2a5/0x4b0 drivers/usb/core/message.c:153
 usbtmc_ioctl_request drivers/usb/class/usbtmc.c:1947 [inline]

The problem is that usbtmc_ioctl_request() uses usb_rcvctrlpipe() for
all of its transfers, whether they are in or out.  It's easy to fix.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48834 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
