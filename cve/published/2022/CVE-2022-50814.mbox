Subject: CVE-2022-50814: crypto: hisilicon/zip - fix mismatch in get/set sgl_sge_nr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/zip - fix mismatch in get/set sgl_sge_nr

KASAN reported this Bug:

	[17619.659757] BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in param_get_int+0x34/0x60
	[17619.673193] Read of size 4 at addr fffff01332d7ed00 by task read_all/1507958
	...
	[17619.698934] The buggy address belongs to the variable:
	[17619.708371]  sgl_sge_nr+0x0/0xffffffffffffa300 [hisi_zip]

There is a mismatch in hisi_zip when get/set the variable sgl_sge_nr.
The type of sgl_sge_nr is u16, and get/set sgl_sge_nr by
param_get/set_int.

Replacing param_get/set_int to param_get/set_ushort can fix this bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50814 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
