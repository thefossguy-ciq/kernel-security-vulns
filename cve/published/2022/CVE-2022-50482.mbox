Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path

A splat from kmem_cache_destroy() was seen with a kernel prior to
commit ee2653bbe89d ("iommu/vt-d: Remove domain and devinfo mempool")
when there was a failure in init_dmars(), because the iommu_domain
cache still had objects. While the mempool code is now gone, there
still is a leak of the si_domain memory if init_dmars() fails. So
clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50482 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
