On abort timeout, completion was called without checking if the I/O was
already completed.

Verify that I/O and abort request are indeed outstanding before attempting
completion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50493 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
