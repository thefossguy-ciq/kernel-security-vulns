Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtw88: fix memory overrun and memory leak during hw_scan

Previously we allocated less memory than actual required, overwrite
to the buffer causes the mm module to complaint and raise access
violation faults. Along with potential memory leaks when returned
early. Fix these by passing the correct size and proper deinit flow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49231 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec5da191bfcd5fd22b95459b623694f66c1cc10b
