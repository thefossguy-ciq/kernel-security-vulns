Subject: CVE-2022-50527: drm/amdgpu: Fix size validation for non-exclusive domains (v4)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix size validation for non-exclusive domains (v4)

Fix amdgpu_bo_validate_size() to check whether the TTM domain manager for the
requested memory exists, else we get a kernel oops when dereferencing "man".

v2: Make the patch standalone, i.e. not dependent on local patches.
v3: Preserve old behaviour and just check that the manager pointer is not
    NULL.
v4: Complain if GTT domain requested and it is uninitialized--most likely a
    bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50527 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
