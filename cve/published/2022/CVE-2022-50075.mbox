Subject: CVE-2022-50075: tracing/eprobes: Have event probes be consistent with kprobes and uprobes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/eprobes: Have event probes be consistent with kprobes and uprobes

Currently, if a symbol "@" is attempted to be used with an event probe
(eprobes), it will cause a NULL pointer dereference crash.

Both kprobes and uprobes can reference data other than the main registers.
Such as immediate address, symbols and the current task name. Have eprobes
do the same thing.

For "comm", if "comm" is used and the event being attached to does not
have the "comm" field, then make it the "$comm" that kprobes has. This is
consistent to the way histograms and filters work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
