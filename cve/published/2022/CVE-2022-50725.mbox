Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: vidtv: Fix use-after-free in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init()

KASAN reports a use-after-free:
BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in dvb_dmxdev_release+0x4d5/0x5d0 [dvb_core]
Call Trace:
 ...
 dvb_dmxdev_release+0x4d5/0x5d0 [dvb_core]
 vidtv_bridge_probe+0x7bf/0xa40 [dvb_vidtv_bridge]
 platform_probe+0xb6/0x170
 ...
Allocated by task 1238:
 ...

 dvb_dmxdev_init+0x2af/0x4a0 [dvb_core]

Freed by task 1238:
 dvb_register_device+0x6d2/0xa70 [dvb_core]
 dvb_dmxdev_init+0x2af/0x4a0 [dvb_core]
 vidtv_bridge_probe+0x766/0xa40 [dvb_vidtv_bridge]
 ...

It is because the error handling in vidtv_bridge_dvb_init() is wrong.

First, vidtv_bridge_dmx(dev)_init() will clean themselves when fail, but
goto fail_dmx(_dev): calls release functions again, which causes
use-after-free.

Also, in fail_fe, fail_tuner_probe and fail_demod_probe, j = i will cause
out-of-bound when i finished its loop (i == NUM_FE). And the loop
releasing is wrong, although now NUM_FE is 1 so it won't cause problem.

Fix this by correctly releasing everything.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50725 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
