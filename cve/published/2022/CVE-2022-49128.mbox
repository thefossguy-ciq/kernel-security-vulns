Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: Add missing pm_runtime_put_sync

pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the rumtime PM counter
even when it returns an error. Thus a pairing decrement is needed
to prevent refcount leak. Fix this by replacing this API with
pm_runtime_resume_and_get(), which will not change the runtime
PM counter on error. Besides, a matching decrement is needed
on the error handling path to keep the counter balanced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49128 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
