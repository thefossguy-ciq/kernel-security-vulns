Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: avoid hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() in mgmt_init_hdev()

syzbot is again reporting attempt to cancel uninitialized work
at mgmt_index_removed() [1], for setting of HCI_MGMT flag from
mgmt_init_hdev() from hci_mgmt_cmd() from hci_sock_sendmsg() can
race with testing of HCI_MGMT flag from mgmt_index_removed() from
hci_sock_bind() due to lack of serialization via hci_dev_lock().

Since mgmt_init_hdev() is called with mgmt_chan_list_lock held, we can
safely split hci_dev_test_and_set_flag() into hci_dev_test_flag() and
hci_dev_set_flag(). Thus, in order to close this race, set HCI_MGMT flag
after INIT_DELAYED_WORK() completed.

This is a local fix based on mgmt_chan_list_lock. Lack of serialization
via hci_dev_lock() might be causing different race conditions somewhere
else. But a global fix based on hci_dev_lock() should deserve a future
patch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50339 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e53c6180db8dd09de94e0a3bdf4fef6f5f9dd6e6
