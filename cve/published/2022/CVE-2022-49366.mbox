Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix reference count leak in smb_check_perm_dacl()

The issue happens in a specific path in smb_check_perm_dacl(). When
"id" and "uid" have the same value, the function simply jumps out of
the loop without decrementing the reference count of the object
"posix_acls", which is increased by get_acl() earlier. This may
result in memory leaks.

Fix it by decreasing the reference count of "posix_acls" before
jumping to label "check_access_bits".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49366 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
