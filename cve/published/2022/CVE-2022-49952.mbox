Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: fix memory corruption on probe

Add the missing sanity check on the probed-session count to avoid
corrupting memory beyond the fixed-size slab-allocated session array
when there are more than FASTRPC_MAX_SESSIONS sessions defined in the
devicetree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
