Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/virtio: Check whether transferred 2D BO is shmem

Transferred 2D BO always must be a shmem BO. Add check for that to prevent
NULL dereference if userspace passes a VRAM BO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
