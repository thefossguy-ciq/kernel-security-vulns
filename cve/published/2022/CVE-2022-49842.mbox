Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: core: Fix use-after-free in snd_soc_exit()

KASAN reports a use-after-free:

BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in device_del+0xb5b/0xc60

It's bacause in snd_soc_init(), snd_soc_util_init() is possble to fail,
but its ret is ignored, which makes soc_dummy_dev unregistered twice.

snd_soc_init()
    snd_soc_util_init()
        platform_device_register_simple(soc_dummy_dev)
        platform_driver_register() # fail
    	platform_device_unregister(soc_dummy_dev)
    platform_driver_register() # success
...
snd_soc_exit()
    snd_soc_util_exit()
    # soc_dummy_dev will be unregistered for second time

To fix it, handle error and stop snd_soc_init() when util_init() fail.
Also clean debugfs when util_init() or driver_register() fail.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
