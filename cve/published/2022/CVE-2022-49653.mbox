Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: piix4: Fix a memory leak in the EFCH MMIO support

The recently added support for EFCH MMIO regions introduced a memory
leak in that code path. The leak is caused by the fact that
release_resource() merely removes the resource from the tree but does
not free its memory. We need to call release_mem_region() instead,
which does free the memory. As a nice side effect, this brings back
some symmetry between the legacy and MMIO paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49653 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2bf1a6480e8d44658a8ac3bdcec081238873212
