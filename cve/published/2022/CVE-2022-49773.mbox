Subject: CVE-2022-49773: drm/amd/display: Fix optc2_configure warning on dcn314

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix optc2_configure warning on dcn314

[Why]
dcn314 uses optc2_configure_crc() that wraps
optc1_configure_crc() + set additional registers
not applicable to dcn314.
It's not critical but when used leads to warning like:
WARNING: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dc_helper.c
Call Trace:
<TASK>
generic_reg_set_ex+0x6d/0xe0 [amdgpu]
optc2_configure_crc+0x60/0x80 [amdgpu]
dc_stream_configure_crc+0x129/0x150 [amdgpu]
amdgpu_dm_crtc_configure_crc_source+0x5d/0xe0 [amdgpu]

[How]
Use optc1_configure_crc() directly

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
