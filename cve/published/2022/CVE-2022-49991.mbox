Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: avoid corrupting page->mapping in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte

In MCOPY_ATOMIC_CONTINUE case with a non-shared VMA, pages in the page
cache are installed in the ptes.  But hugepage_add_new_anon_rmap is called
for them mistakenly because they're not vm_shared.  This will corrupt the
page->mapping used by page cache code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
