Subject: CVE-2022-50576: serial: pch: Fix PCI device refcount leak in pch_request_dma()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: pch: Fix PCI device refcount leak in pch_request_dma()

As comment of pci_get_slot() says, it returns a pci_device with its
refcount increased. The caller must decrement the reference count by
calling pci_dev_put().

Since 'dma_dev' is only used to filter the channel in filter(), we can
call pci_dev_put() before exiting from pch_request_dma(). Add the
missing pci_dev_put() for the normal and error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50576 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
