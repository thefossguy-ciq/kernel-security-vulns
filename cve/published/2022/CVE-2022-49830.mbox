Subject: CVE-2022-49830: drm/drv: Fix potential memory leak in drm_dev_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/drv: Fix potential memory leak in drm_dev_init()

drm_dev_init() will add drm_dev_init_release() as a callback. When
drmm_add_action() failed, the release function won't be added. As the
result, the ref cnt added by device_get() in drm_dev_init() won't be put
by drm_dev_init_release(), which leads to the memleak. Use
drmm_add_action_or_reset() instead of drmm_add_action() to prevent
memleak.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
