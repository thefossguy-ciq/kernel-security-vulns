Subject: CVE-2022-50326: media: airspy: fix memory leak in airspy probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: airspy: fix memory leak in airspy probe

The commit ca9dc8d06ab6 ("media: airspy: respect the DMA coherency
 rules") moves variable buf from stack to heap, however, it only frees
buf in the error handling code, missing deallocation in the success
path.

Fix this by freeing buf in the success path since this variable does not
have any references in other code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50326 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4285dd02b6b2ca3435b65fb62c053dd9408fd71
