Subject: CVE-2022-50548: media: i2c: hi846: Fix memory leak in hi846_parse_dt()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: i2c: hi846: Fix memory leak in hi846_parse_dt()

If any of the checks related to the supported link frequencies fail, then
the V4L2 fwnode resources don't get released before returning, which leads
to a memleak. Fix this by properly freeing the V4L2 fwnode data in a
designated label.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50548 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
