Subject: CVE-2022-50240: binder: fix UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix UAF of alloc->vma in race with munmap()

In commit 720c24192404 ("ANDROID: binder: change down_write to
down_read") binder assumed the mmap read lock is sufficient to protect
alloc->vma inside binder_update_page_range(). This used to be accurate
until commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
munmap"), which now downgrades the mmap_lock after detaching the vma
from the rbtree in munmap(). Then it proceeds to teardown and free the
vma with only the read lock held.

This means that accesses to alloc->vma in binder_update_page_range() now
will race with vm_area_free() in munmap() and can cause a UAF as shown
in the following KASAN trace:

  ==================================================================

To prevent the race above, revert back to taking the mmap write lock
inside binder_update_page_range(). One might expect an increase of mmap
lock contention. However, binder already serializes these calls via top
level alloc->mutex. Also, there was no performance impact shown when
running the binder benchmark tests.

Note this patch is specific to stable branches 5.4 and 5.10. Since in
newer kernel releases binder no longer caches a pointer to the vma.
Instead, it has been refactored to use vma_lookup() which avoids the
issue described here. This switch was introduced in commit a43cfc87caaf
("android: binder: stop saving a pointer to the VMA").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50240 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
