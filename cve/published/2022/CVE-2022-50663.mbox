Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: fix possible memory leak in stmmac_dvr_probe()

The bitmap_free() should be called to free priv->af_xdp_zc_qps
when create_singlethread_workqueue() fails, otherwise there will
be a memory leak, so we add the err path error_wq_init to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50663 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
