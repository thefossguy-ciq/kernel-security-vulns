Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: fix a bug of accessing array out of bounds

When error occurs in parsing jpeg, the slot isn't acquired yet, it may
be the default value MXC_MAX_SLOTS.
If the driver access the slot using the incorrect slot number, it will
access array out of bounds.
The result is the driver will change num_domains, which follows
slot_data in struct mxc_jpeg_dev.
Then the driver won't detach the pm domain at rmmod, which will lead to
kernel panic when trying to insmod again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49163 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
