Subject: CVE-2022-50736: RDMA/siw: Fix immediate work request flush to completion queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix immediate work request flush to completion queue

Correctly set send queue element opcode during immediate work request
flushing in post sendqueue operation, if the QP is in ERROR state.
An undefined ocode value results in out-of-bounds access to an array
for mapping the opcode between siw internal and RDMA core representation
in work completion generation. It resulted in a KASAN BUG report
of type 'global-out-of-bounds' during NFSoRDMA testing.

This patch further fixes a potential case of a malicious user which may
write undefined values for completion queue elements status or opcode,
if the CQ is memory mapped to user land. It avoids the same out-of-bounds
access to arrays for status and opcode mapping as described above.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
