Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6/sit: use DEV_STATS_INC() to avoid data-races

syzbot/KCSAN reported that multiple cpus are updating dev->stats.tx_error
concurrently.

This is because sit tunnels are NETIF_F_LLTX, meaning their ndo_start_xmit()
is not protected by a spinlock.

While original KCSAN report was about tx path, rx path has the same issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50764 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
