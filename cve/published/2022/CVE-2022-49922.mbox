Subject: CVE-2022-49922: nfc: nfcmrvl: Fix potential memory leak in nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: nfcmrvl: Fix potential memory leak in nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send()

nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send() will be called by nfcmrvl_nci_send(), and skb
should be freed in nfcmrvl_i2c_nci_send(). However, nfcmrvl_nci_send()
will only free skb when i2c_master_send() return >=0, which means skb
will memleak when i2c_master_send() failed. Free skb no matter whether
i2c_master_send() succeeds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49922 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
