Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix hard lockup when reading the rx_monitor from debugfs

During I/O and simultaneous cat of /sys/kernel/debug/lpfc/fnX/rx_monitor, a
hard lockup similar to the call trace below may occur.

The spin_lock_bh in lpfc_rx_monitor_report is not protecting from timer
interrupts as expected, so change the strength of the spin lock to _irq.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Hard LOCKUP
CPU: 3 PID: 110402 Comm: cat Kdump: loaded

exception RIP: native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+91

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
