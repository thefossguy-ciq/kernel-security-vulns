Subject: CVE-2022-49962: xhci: Fix null pointer dereference in remove if xHC has only one roothub

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xhci: Fix null pointer dereference in remove if xHC has only one roothub

The remove path in xhci platform driver tries to remove and put both main
and shared hcds even if only a main hcd exists (one roothub)

This causes a null pointer dereference in reboot for those controllers.

Check that the shared_hcd exists before trying to remove it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49962 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7081b2f34ff291ada012bd6abacaf7d51c4cf73f
