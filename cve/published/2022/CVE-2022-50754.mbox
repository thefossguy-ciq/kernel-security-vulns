Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

apparmor: fix a memleak in multi_transaction_new()

In multi_transaction_new(), the variable t is not freed or passed out
on the failure of copy_from_user(t->data, buf, size), which could lead
to a memleak.

Fix this bug by adding a put_multi_transaction(t) in the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50754 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
