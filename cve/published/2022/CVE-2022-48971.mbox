Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix not cleanup led when bt_init fails

bt_init() calls bt_leds_init() to register led, but if it fails later,
bt_leds_cleanup() is not called to unregister it.

This can cause panic if the argument "bluetooth-power" in text is freed
and then another led_trigger_register() tries to access it:

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc06d3bc0
RIP: 0010:strcmp+0xc/0x30
  Call Trace:
    <TASK>
    led_trigger_register+0x10d/0x4f0
    led_trigger_register_simple+0x7d/0x100
    bt_init+0x39/0xf7 [bluetooth]
    do_one_initcall+0xd0/0x4e0

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48971 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
