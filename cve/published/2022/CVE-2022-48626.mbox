Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

moxart: fix potential use-after-free on remove path

It was reported that the mmc host structure could be accessed after it
was freed in moxart_remove(), so fix this by saving the base register of
the device and using it instead of the pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48626 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
