Subject: CVE-2022-50272: media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()

Wei Chen reports a kernel bug as blew:

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000010-0x0000000000000017]
...

In az6027_i2c_xfer(), if msg[i].addr is 0x99,
a null-ptr-deref will caused when accessing msg[i].buf.
For msg[i].len is 0 and msg[i].buf is null.

Fix this by checking msg[i].len in az6027_i2c_xfer().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50272 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
