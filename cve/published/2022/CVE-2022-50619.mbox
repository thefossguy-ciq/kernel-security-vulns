Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix memory leak in kfd_mem_dmamap_userptr()

If the number of pages from the userptr BO differs from the SG BO then the
allocated memory for the SG table doesn't get freed before returning
-EINVAL, which may lead to a memory leak in some error paths. Fix this by
checking the number of pages before allocating memory for the SG table.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50619 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/304a10161696d86300ceab1cbe72b2d74b8cdd94
