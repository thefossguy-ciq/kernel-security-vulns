Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: fix a use-after-free in nouveau_gem_prime_import_sg_table()

nouveau_bo_init() is backed by ttm_bo_init() and ferries its return code
back to the caller. On failures, ttm will call nouveau_bo_del_ttm() and
free the memory.Thus, when nouveau_bo_init() returns an error, the gem
object has already been released. Then the call to nouveau_bo_ref() will
use the freed "nvbo->bo" and lead to a use-after-free bug.

We should delete the call to nouveau_bo_ref() to avoid the use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50454 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
