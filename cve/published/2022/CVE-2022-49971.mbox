Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: Fix a potential gpu_metrics_table memory leak

Memory is allocated for gpu_metrics_table in
smu_v13_0_4_init_smc_tables(), but not freed in
smu_v13_0_4_fini_smc_tables(). This may cause memory leaks, fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49971 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.19.7 with commit 4b25bdb54578f3b96ff055e5d27bc1cb82950e51
	Fixed in 6.0 with commit 5afb76522a0af0513b6dc01f84128a73206b051b

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-49971
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/pm/swsmu/smu13/smu_v13_0_4_ppt.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b25bdb54578f3b96ff055e5d27bc1cb82950e51
