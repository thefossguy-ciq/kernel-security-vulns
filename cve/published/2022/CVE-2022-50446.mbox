Subject: CVE-2022-50446: ARC: mm: fix leakage of memory allocated for PTE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARC: mm: fix leakage of memory allocated for PTE

Since commit d9820ff ("ARC: mm: switch pgtable_t back to struct page *")
a memory leakage problem occurs. Memory allocated for page table entries
not released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by
a small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several
runs, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will
continue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this
issue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.

As described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct
page *, a pointer to "struct page" and appropriate functions are used to
allocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't
changed and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.
Than this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result
this function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.

Fix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to
struct page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50446 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
