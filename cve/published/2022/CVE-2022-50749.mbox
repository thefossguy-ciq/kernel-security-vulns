Subject: CVE-2022-50749: acct: fix potential integer overflow in encode_comp_t()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acct: fix potential integer overflow in encode_comp_t()

The integer overflow is descripted with following codes:
  > 317 static comp_t encode_comp_t(u64 value)
  > 318 {
  > 319         int exp, rnd;
    ......
  > 341         exp <<= MANTSIZE;
  > 342         exp += value;
  > 343         return exp;
  > 344 }

Currently comp_t is defined as type of '__u16', but the variable 'exp' is
type of 'int', so overflow would happen when variable 'exp' in line 343 is
greater than 65535.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50749 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
