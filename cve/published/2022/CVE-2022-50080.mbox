Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: add overflow check in register_shm_helper()

With special lengths supplied by user space, register_shm_helper() has
an integer overflow when calculating the number of pages covered by a
supplied user space memory region.

This causes internal_get_user_pages_fast() a helper function of
pin_user_pages_fast() to do a NULL pointer dereference:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 1 PID: 173 Comm: optee_example_a Not tainted 5.19.0 #11
  Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015
  pc : internal_get_user_pages_fast+0x474/0xa80
  Call trace:
   internal_get_user_pages_fast+0x474/0xa80
   pin_user_pages_fast+0x24/0x4c
   register_shm_helper+0x194/0x330

   tee_ioctl+0xd0/0x11a0
   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0xa8/0xec
   invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114

Fix this by adding an an explicit call to access_ok() in
tee_shm_register_user_buf() to catch an invalid user space address
early.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50080 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
