Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: dev: fix skb drop check

In commit a6d190f8c767 ("can: skb: drop tx skb if in listen only
mode") the priv->ctrlmode element is read even on virtual CAN
interfaces that do not create the struct can_priv at startup. This
out-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN
interfaces like vcan and vxcan.

This patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper
for CAN interface drivers that provide the required information in
struct can_priv.

[mkl: patch pch_can, too]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49844 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/386c49fe31ee748e053860b3bac7794a933ac9ac
