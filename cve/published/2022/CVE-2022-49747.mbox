Subject: CVE-2022-49747: erofs/zmap.c: Fix incorrect offset calculation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs/zmap.c: Fix incorrect offset calculation

Effective offset to add to length was being incorrectly calculated,
which resulted in iomap->length being set to 0, triggering a WARN_ON
in iomap_iter_done().

Fix that, and describe it in comments.

This was reported as a crash by syzbot under an issue about a warning
encountered in iomap_iter_done(), but unrelated to erofs.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
