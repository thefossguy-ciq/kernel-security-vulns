Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: m_can: pci: add missing m_can_class_free_dev() in probe/remove methods

In m_can_pci_remove() and error handling path of m_can_pci_probe(),
m_can_class_free_dev() should be called to free resource allocated by
m_can_class_allocate_dev(), otherwise there will be memleak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49024 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
