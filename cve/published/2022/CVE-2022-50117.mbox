Subject: CVE-2022-50117: vfio: Split migration ops from main device ops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio: Split migration ops from main device ops

vfio core checks whether the driver sets some migration op (e.g.
set_state/get_state) and accordingly calls its op.

However, currently mlx5 driver sets the above ops without regards to its
migration caps.

This might lead to unexpected usage/Oops if user space may call to the
above ops even if the driver doesn't support migration. As for example,
the migration state_mutex is not initialized in that case.

The cleanest way to manage that seems to split the migration ops from
the main device ops, this will let the driver setting them separately
from the main ops when it's applicable.

As part of that, validate ops construction on registration and include a
check for VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY since the uAPI claims it must be set
in migration_flags.

HISI driver was changed as well to match this scheme.

This scheme may enable down the road to come with some extra group of
ops (e.g. DMA log) that can be set without regards to the other options
based on driver caps.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50117 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
