Subject: CVE-2022-50330: crypto: cavium - prevent integer overflow loading firmware

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: cavium - prevent integer overflow loading firmware

The "code_length" value comes from the firmware file.  If your firmware
is untrusted realistically there is probably very little you can do to
protect yourself.  Still we try to limit the damage as much as possible.
Also Smatch marks any data read from the filesystem as untrusted and
prints warnings if it not capped correctly.

The "ntohl(ucode->code_length) * 2" multiplication can have an
integer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50330 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
