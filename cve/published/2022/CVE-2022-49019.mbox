Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: nixge: fix NULL dereference

In function nixge_hw_dma_bd_release() dereference of NULL pointer
priv->rx_bd_v is possible for the case of its allocation failure in
nixge_hw_dma_bd_init().

Move for() loop with priv->rx_bd_v dereference under the check for
its validity.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49019 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
