Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-ipc: Do not process IPC reply before firmware boot

It is not yet clear, but it is possible to create a firmware so broken
that it will send a reply message before a FW_READY message (it is not
yet clear if FW_READY will arrive later).
Since the reply_data is allocated only after the FW_READY message, this
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference if not filtered out.

The issue was reported with IPC4 firmware but the same condition is present
for IPC3.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50015 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.19.4 with commit 48945246cf802b9866f3a821103f1a7a196baf68
	Fixed in 6.0 with commit 499cc881b09c8283ab5e75b0d6d21cb427722161

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-50015
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/soc/sof/intel/hda-ipc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48945246cf802b9866f3a821103f1a7a196baf68
