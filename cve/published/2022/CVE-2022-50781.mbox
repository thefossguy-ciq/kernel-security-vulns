Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amdgpu/pm: prevent array underflow in vega20_odn_edit_dpm_table()

In the PP_OD_EDIT_VDDC_CURVE case the "input_index" variable is capped at
2 but not checked for negative values so it results in an out of bounds
read.  This value comes from the user via sysfs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50781 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
