Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mt76: mt7915: Fix PCI device refcount leak in mt7915_pci_init_hif2()

As comment of pci_get_device() says, it returns a pci_device with its
refcount increased. We need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the
refcount. Save the return value of pci_get_device() and call
pci_dev_put() to decrease the refcount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50464 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8abc6579667129afd13ff2ccb0319ba3f46e6995
