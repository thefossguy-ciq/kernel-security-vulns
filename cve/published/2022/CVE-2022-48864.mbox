Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa/mlx5: add validation for VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command

When control vq receives a VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_MQ_VQ_PAIRS_SET command
request from the driver, presently there is no validation against the
number of queue pairs to configure, or even if multiqueue had been
negotiated or not is unverified. This may lead to kernel panic due to
uninitialized resource for the queues were there any bogus request
sent down by untrusted driver. Tie up the loose ends there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
