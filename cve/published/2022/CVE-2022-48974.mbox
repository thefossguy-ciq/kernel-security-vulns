Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: fix using __this_cpu_add in preemptible

Currently in nf_conntrack_hash_check_insert(), when it fails in
nf_ct_ext_valid_pre/post(), NF_CT_STAT_INC() will be called in the
preemptible context, a call trace can be triggered:

   BUG: using __this_cpu_add() in preemptible [00000000] code: conntrack/1636
   caller is nf_conntrack_hash_check_insert+0x45/0x430 [nf_conntrack]
   Call Trace:

    netlink_sendmsg+0x257/0x4f0
    sock_sendmsg+0x5f/0x70

This patch is to fix it by changing to use NF_CT_STAT_INC_ATOMIC() for
nf_ct_ext_valid_pre/post() check in nf_conntrack_hash_check_insert(),
as well as nf_ct_ext_valid_post() in __nf_conntrack_confirm().

Note that nf_ct_ext_valid_pre() check in __nf_conntrack_confirm() is
safe to use NF_CT_STAT_INC(), as it's under local_bh_disable().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48974 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9bf1138a5db419db13bd9fcd3a7178d6bb20f7c
