Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: smm: number of GPRs in the SMRAM image depends on the image format

On 64 bit host, if the guest doesn't have X86_FEATURE_LM, KVM will
access 16 gprs to 32-bit smram image, causing out-ouf-bound ram
access.

On 32 bit host, the rsm_load_state_64/enter_smm_save_state_64
is compiled out, thus access overflow can't happen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49883 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7ebfbea0f52550d7cdf12c38f3f5eaa7b2b6494
