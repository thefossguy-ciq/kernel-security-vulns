Subject: CVE-2022-50101: video: fbdev: vt8623fb: Check the size of screen before memset_io()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: vt8623fb: Check the size of screen before memset_io()

In the function vt8623fb_set_par(), the value of 'screen_size' is
calculated by the user input. If the user provides the improper value,
the value of 'screen_size' may larger than 'info->screen_size', which
may cause the following bug:

[  583.339036] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc90005000000
[  583.339049] #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
[  583.339052] #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
[  583.339074] RIP: 0010:memset_orig+0x33/0xb0
[  583.339110] Call Trace:

[  583.339181]  do_fb_ioctl+0x234/0x670
[  583.339209]  fb_ioctl+0xdd/0x130

Fix the this by checking the value of 'screen_size' before memset_io().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
