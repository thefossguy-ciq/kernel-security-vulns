Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: mt8183: fix refcount leak in mt8183_mt6358_ts3a227_max98357_dev_probe()

The node returned by of_parse_phandle() with refcount incremented,
of_node_put() needs be called when finish using it. So add it in the
error path in mt8183_mt6358_ts3a227_max98357_dev_probe().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50392 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
