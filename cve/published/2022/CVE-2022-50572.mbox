Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: audio-graph-card: fix refcount leak of cpu_ep in __graph_for_each_link()

The of_get_next_child() returns a node with refcount incremented, and
decrements the refcount of prev. So in the error path of the while loop,
of_node_put() needs be called for cpu_ep.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50572 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
