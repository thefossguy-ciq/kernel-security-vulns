Subject: CVE-2022-50533: wifi: mac80211: mlme: fix null-ptr deref on failed assoc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: mlme: fix null-ptr deref on failed assoc

If association to an AP without a link 0 fails, then we crash in
tracing because it assumes that either ap_mld_addr or link 0 BSS
is valid, since we clear sdata->vif.valid_links and then don't
add the ap_mld_addr to the struct.

Since we clear also sdata->vif.cfg.ap_addr, keep a local copy of
it and assign it earlier, before clearing valid_links, to fix
this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50533 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
