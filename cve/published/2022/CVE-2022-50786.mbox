Subject: CVE-2022-50786: media: s5p-mfc: Clear workbit to handle error condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: s5p-mfc: Clear workbit to handle error condition

During error on CLOSE_INSTANCE command, ctx_work_bits was not getting
cleared. During consequent mfc execution NULL pointer dereferencing of
this context led to kernel panic. This patch fixes this issue by making
sure to clear ctx_work_bits always.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50786 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
