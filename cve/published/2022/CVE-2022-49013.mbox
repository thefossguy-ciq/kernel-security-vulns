Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: fix memory leak in sctp_stream_outq_migrate()

When sctp_stream_outq_migrate() is called to release stream out resources,
the memory pointed to by prio_head in stream out is not released.

The memory leak information is as follows:
 unreferenced object 0xffff88801fe79f80 (size 64):
   comm "sctp_repo", pid 7957, jiffies 4294951704 (age 36.480s)
   hex dump (first 32 bytes):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
