Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix potential null-deref in dm_resume

[Why]
Fixing smatch error:
dm_resume() error: we previously assumed 'aconnector->dc_link' could be null

[How]
Check if dc_link null at the beginning of the loop,
so further checks can be dropped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50535 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
