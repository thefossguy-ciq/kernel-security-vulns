Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: fix resource leak in regulator_register()

I got some resource leak reports while doing fault injection test:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 100,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:

After calling regulator_resolve_supply(), the 'rdev->supply' is set
by set_supply(), after this set, in the error path, the resources
need be released, so call regulator_put() to avoid the leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50724 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
