Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/meson: Fix refcount bugs in meson_vpu_has_available_connectors()

In this function, there are two refcount leak bugs:
(1) when breaking out of for_each_endpoint_of_node(), we need call
the of_node_put() for the 'ep';
(2) we should call of_node_put() for the reference returned by
of_graph_get_remote_port() when it is not used anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50038 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
