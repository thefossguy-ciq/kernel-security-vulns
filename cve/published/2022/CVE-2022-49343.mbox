Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid cycles in directory h-tree

A maliciously corrupted filesystem can contain cycles in the h-tree
stored inside a directory. That can easily lead to the kernel corrupting
tree nodes that were already verified under its hands while doing a node
split and consequently accessing unallocated memory. Fix the problem by
verifying traversed block numbers are unique.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49343 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
