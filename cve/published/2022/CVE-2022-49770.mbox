Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: avoid putting the realm twice when decoding snaps fails

When decoding the snaps fails it maybe leaving the 'first_realm'
and 'realm' pointing to the same snaprealm memory. And then it'll
put it twice and could cause random use-after-free, BUG_ON, etc
issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49770 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
