Subject: CVE-2022-49836: siox: fix possible memory leak in siox_device_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

siox: fix possible memory leak in siox_device_add()

If device_register() returns error in siox_device_add(),
the name allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As
comment of device_register() says, it should use put_device()
to give up the reference in the error path. So fix this
by calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in
kobject_cleanup(), and sdevice is freed in siox_device_release(),
set it to null in error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49836 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
