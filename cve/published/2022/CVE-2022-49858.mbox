Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-pf: Fix SQE threshold checking

Current way of checking available SQE count which is based on
HW updated SQB count could result in driver submitting an SQE
even before CQE for the previously transmitted SQE at the same
index is processed in NAPI resulting losing SKB pointers,
hence a leak. Fix this by checking a consumer index which
is updated once CQE is processed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49858 to this issue.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-49858
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
