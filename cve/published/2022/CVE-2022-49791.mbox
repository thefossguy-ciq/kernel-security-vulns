Subject: CVE-2022-49791: io_uring: fix multishot accept request leaks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix multishot accept request leaks

Having REQ_F_POLLED set doesn't guarantee that the request is
executed as a multishot from the polling path. Fortunately for us, if
the code thinks it's multishot issue when it's not, it can only ask to
skip completion so leaking the request. Use issue_flags to mark
multipoll issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49791 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
