Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add EXT4_IGET_BAD flag to prevent unexpected bad inode

There are many places that will get unhappy (and crash) when ext4_iget()
returns a bad inode. However, if iget the boot loader inode, allows a bad
inode to be returned, because the inode may not be initialized. This
mechanism can be used to bypass some checks and cause panic. To solve this
problem, we add a special iget flag EXT4_IGET_BAD. Only with this flag
we'd be returning bad inode from ext4_iget(), otherwise we always return
the error code if the inode is bad inode.(suggested by Jan Kara)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50485 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
