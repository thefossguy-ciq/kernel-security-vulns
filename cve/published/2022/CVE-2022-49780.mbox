Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: tcm_loop: Fix possible name leak in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus()

If device_register() fails in tcm_loop_setup_hba_bus(), the name allocated
by dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment of device_register() says, it
should use put_device() to give up the reference in the error path. So fix
this by calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().
The 'tl_hba' will be freed in tcm_loop_release_adapter(), so it don't need
goto error label in this case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49780 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
