Subject: CVE-2022-50623: fpga: prevent integer overflow in dfl_feature_ioctl_set_irq()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fpga: prevent integer overflow in dfl_feature_ioctl_set_irq()

The "hdr.count * sizeof(s32)" multiplication can overflow on 32 bit
systems leading to memory corruption.  Use array_size() to fix that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50623 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
