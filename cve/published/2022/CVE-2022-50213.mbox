Subject: CVE-2022-50213: netfilter: nf_tables: do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table

When doing lookups for sets on the same batch by using its ID, a set from a
different table can be used.

Then, when the table is removed, a reference to the set may be kept after
the set is freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.

When looking for sets by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup by
name, and only return sets belonging to that same table.

This fixes CVE-2022-2586, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50213 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
