Subject: CVE-2022-49944: Revert "usb: typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "usb: typec: ucsi: add a common function ucsi_unregister_connectors()"

The recent commit 87d0e2f41b8c ("usb: typec: ucsi: add a common
function ucsi_unregister_connectors()") introduced a regression that
caused NULL dereference at reading the power supply sysfs.  It's a
stale sysfs entry that should have been removed but remains with NULL
ops.  The commit changed the error handling to skip the entries after
a NULL con->wq, and this leaves the power device unreleased.

For addressing the regression, the straight revert is applied here.
Further code improvements can be done from the scratch again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49944 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
