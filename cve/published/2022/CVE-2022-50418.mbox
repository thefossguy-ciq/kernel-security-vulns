Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: mhi: fix potential memory leak in ath11k_mhi_register()

mhi_alloc_controller() allocates a memory space for mhi_ctrl. When gets
some error, mhi_ctrl should be freed with mhi_free_controller(). But
when ath11k_mhi_read_addr_from_dt() fails, the function returns without
calling mhi_free_controller(), which will lead to a memory leak.

We can fix it by calling mhi_free_controller() when
ath11k_mhi_read_addr_from_dt() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50418 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/72ef896e80b6ec7cdc1dd42577045f8e7c9c32b3
