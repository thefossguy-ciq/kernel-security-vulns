Subject: CVE-2022-49968: ieee802154/adf7242: defer destroy_workqueue call

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ieee802154/adf7242: defer destroy_workqueue call

There is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below

  (FREE)                     |  (USE)
  adf7242_remove             |  adf7242_channel
   cancel_delayed_work_sync  |
    destroy_workqueue (1)    |   adf7242_cmd_rx
                             |    mod_delayed_work (2)
                             |

The root cause for this race is that the upper layer (ieee802154) is
unaware of this detaching event and the function adf7242_channel can
be called without any checks.

To fix this, we can add a flag write at the beginning of adf7242_remove
and add flag check in adf7242_channel. Or we can just defer the
destructive operation like other commit 3e0588c291d6 ("hamradio: defer
ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev") which let the
ieee802154_unregister_hw() to handle the synchronization. This patch
takes the second option.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49968 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
