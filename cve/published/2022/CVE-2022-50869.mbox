Subject: CVE-2022-50869: fs/ntfs3: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in r_page

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in r_page

When PAGE_SIZE is 64K, if read_log_page is called by log_read_rst for
the first time, the size of *buffer would be equal to
DefaultLogPageSize(4K).But for *buffer operations like memcpy,
if the memory area size(n) which being assigned to buffer is larger
than 4K (log->page_size(64K) or bytes(64K-page_off)), it will cause
an out of boundary error.
 Call trace:

Fix this by setting variable r_page to NULL in log_read_rst.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50869 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
