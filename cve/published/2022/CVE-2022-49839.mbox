Subject: CVE-2022-49839: scsi: scsi_transport_sas: Fix error handling in sas_phy_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: scsi_transport_sas: Fix error handling in sas_phy_add()

If transport_add_device() fails in sas_phy_add(), the kernel will crash
trying to delete the device in transport_remove_device() called from
sas_remove_host().

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000108
CPU: 61 PID: 42829 Comm: rmmod Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.1.0-rc1+ #173

Fix this by checking and handling return value of transport_add_device()
in sas_phy_add().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
