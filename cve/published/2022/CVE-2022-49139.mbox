Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: fix null ptr deref on hci_sync_conn_complete_evt

This event is just specified for SCO and eSCO link types.
On the reception of a HCI_Synchronous_Connection_Complete for a BDADDR
of an existing LE connection, LE link type and a status that triggers the
second case of the packet processing a NULL pointer dereference happens,
as conn->link is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49139 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
