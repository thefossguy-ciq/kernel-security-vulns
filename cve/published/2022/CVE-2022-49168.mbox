Subject: CVE-2022-49168: btrfs: do not clean up repair bio if submit fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not clean up repair bio if submit fails

The submit helper will always run bio_endio() on the bio if it fails to
submit, so cleaning up the bio just leads to a variety of use-after-free
and NULL pointer dereference bugs because we race with the endio
function that is cleaning up the bio.  Instead just return BLK_STS_OK as
the repair function has to continue to process the rest of the pages,
and the endio for the repair bio will do the appropriate cleanup for the
page that it was given.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49168 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
