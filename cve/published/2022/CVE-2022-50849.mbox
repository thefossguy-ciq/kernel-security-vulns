Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pstore: Avoid kcore oops by vmap()ing with VM_IOREMAP

An oops can be induced by running 'cat /proc/kcore > /dev/null' on
devices using pstore with the ram backend because kmap_atomic() assumes
lowmem pages are accessible with __va().

During early boot, memblock reserves the pages for the ramoops reserved
memory node in DT that would otherwise be part of the direct lowmem
mapping. Pstore's ram backend reuses those reserved pages to change the
memory type (writeback or non-cached) by passing the pages to vmap()
(see pfn_to_page() usage in persistent_ram_vmap() for more details) with
specific flags. When read_kcore() starts iterating over the vmalloc
region, it runs over the virtual address that vmap() returned for
ramoops. In aligned_vread() the virtual address is passed to
vmalloc_to_page() which returns the page struct for the reserved lowmem
area. That lowmem page is passed to kmap_atomic(), which effectively
calls page_to_virt() that assumes a lowmem page struct must be directly
accessible with __va() and friends. These pages are mapped via vmap()
though, and the lowmem mapping was never made, so accessing them via the
lowmem virtual address oopses like above.

Let's side-step this problem by passing VM_IOREMAP to vmap(). This will
tell vread() to not include the ramoops region in the kcore. Instead the
area will look like a bunch of zeros. The alternative is to teach kmap()
about vmalloc areas that intersect with lowmem. Presumably such a change
isn't a one-liner, and there isn't much interest in inspecting the
ramoops region in kcore files anyway, so the most expedient route is
taken for now.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
