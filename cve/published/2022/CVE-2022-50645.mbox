Subject: CVE-2022-50645: EDAC/i10nm: fix refcount leak in pci_get_dev_wrapper()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/i10nm: fix refcount leak in pci_get_dev_wrapper()

As the comment of pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() says, it returns
a PCI device with refcount incremented, so it doesn't need to
call an extra pci_dev_get() in pci_get_dev_wrapper(), and the PCI
device needs to be put in the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50645 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
