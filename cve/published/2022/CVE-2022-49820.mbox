Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mctp i2c: don't count unused / invalid keys for flow release

We're currently hitting the WARN_ON in mctp_i2c_flow_release:

    if (midev->release_count > midev->i2c_lock_count) {
        WARN_ONCE(1, "release count overflow");

This may be hit if we expire a flow before sending the first packet it
contains - as we will not be pairing the increment of release_count
(performed on flow release) with the i2c lock operation (only
performed on actual TX).

To fix this, only release a flow if we've encountered it previously (ie,
dev_flow_state does not indicate NEW), as we will mark the flow as
ACTIVE at the same time as accounting for the i2c lock operation. We
also need to add an INVALID flow state, to indicate when we've done the
release.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49820 to this issue.

	drivers/net/mctp/mctp-i2c.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5915a9a3ab4067ef8996a57738d156eabeb3a12
