Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/bios: fix a memory leak in generate_lfp_data_ptrs

When (size != 0 || ptrs->lvds_ entries != 3), the program tries to
free() the ptrs. However, the ptrs is not created by calling kzmalloc(),
but is obtained by pointer offset operation.
This may lead to memory leaks or undefined behavior.

Fix this by replacing the arguments of kfree() with ptrs_block.

(cherry picked from commit 7674cd0b7d28b952151c3df26bbfa7e07eb2b4ec)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50287 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4758d04014cfe6cdb6e9b4738d1d6728487bbb3a
