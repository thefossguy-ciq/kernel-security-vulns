Subject: CVE-2022-50615: perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in snr_uncore_mmio_map()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in snr_uncore_mmio_map()

pci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned
pci_dev, so snr_uncore_get_mc_dev() will return a pci_dev with its
reference count increased. We need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the
reference count. Let's add the missing pci_dev_put().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50615 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
