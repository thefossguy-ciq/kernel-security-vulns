Subject: CVE-2022-50319: coresight: trbe: remove cpuhp instance node before remove cpuhp state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: trbe: remove cpuhp instance node before remove cpuhp state

cpuhp_state_add_instance() and cpuhp_state_remove_instance() should
be used in pairs. Or there will lead to the warn on
cpuhp_remove_multi_state() since the cpuhp_step list is not empty.

The following is the error log with 'rmmod coresight-trbe':
Error: Removing state 215 which has instances left.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
