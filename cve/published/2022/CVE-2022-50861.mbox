Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Finish converting the NFSv2 GETACL result encoder

The xdr_stream conversion inadvertently left some code that set the
page_len of the send buffer. The XDR stream encoders should handle
this automatically now.

This oversight adds garbage past the end of the Reply message.
Clients typically ignore the garbage, but NFSD does not need to send
it, as it leaks stale memory contents onto the wire.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50861 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
