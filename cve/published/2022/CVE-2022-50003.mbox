Subject: CVE-2022-50003: ice: xsk: prohibit usage of non-balanced queue id

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: xsk: prohibit usage of non-balanced queue id

Fix the following scenario:
1. ethtool -L $IFACE rx 8 tx 96
2. xdpsock -q 10 -t -z

Above refers to a case where user would like to attach XSK socket in
txonly mode at a queue id that does not have a corresponding Rx queue.
At this moment ice's XSK logic is tightly bound to act on a "queue pair",
e.g. both Tx and Rx queues at a given queue id are disabled/enabled and
both of them will get XSK pool assigned, which is broken for the presented
queue configuration. This results in the splat included at the bottom,
which is basically an OOB access to Rx ring array.

To fix this, allow using the ids only in scope of "combined" queues
reported by ethtool. However, logic should be rewritten to allow such
configurations later on, which would end up as a complete rewrite of the
control path, so let us go with this temporary fix.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
