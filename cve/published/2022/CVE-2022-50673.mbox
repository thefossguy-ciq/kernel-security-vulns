Subject: CVE-2022-50673: ext4: fix use-after-free in ext4_orphan_cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix use-after-free in ext4_orphan_cleanup

I caught a issue as follows:
==================================================================
 BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __list_add_valid+0x28/0x1a0

==================================================================

Above issue may happen as follows:
-------------------------------------
ext4_fill_super
  ext4_orphan_cleanup
   --- loop1: assume last_orphan is 12 ---
    list_add(&EXT4_I(inode)->i_orphan, &EXT4_SB(sb)->s_orphan)
    ext4_truncate --> return 0
      ext4_inode_attach_jinode --> return -ENOMEM
    iput(inode) --> free inode<12>
   --- loop2: last_orphan is still 12 ---
    list_add(&EXT4_I(inode)->i_orphan, &EXT4_SB(sb)->s_orphan);
    // use inode<12> and trigger UAF

To solve this issue, we need to propagate the return value of
ext4_inode_attach_jinode() appropriately.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50673 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
