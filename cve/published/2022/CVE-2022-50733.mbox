Subject: CVE-2022-50733: usb: idmouse: fix an uninit-value in idmouse_open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: idmouse: fix an uninit-value in idmouse_open

In idmouse_create_image, if any ftip_command fails, it will
go to the reset label. However, this leads to the data in
bulk_in_buffer[HEADER..IMGSIZE] uninitialized. And the check
for valid image incurs an uninitialized dereference.

Fix this by moving the check before reset label since this
check only be valid if the data after bulk_in_buffer[HEADER]
has concrete data.

Note that this is found by KMSAN, so only kernel compilation
is tested.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50733 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
