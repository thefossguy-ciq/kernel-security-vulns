Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: health: afe4403: Fix oob read in afe4403_read_raw

KASAN report out-of-bounds read as follows:

BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in afe4403_read_raw+0x42e/0x4c0
Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc02ac638 by task cat/279

Call Trace:
 afe4403_read_raw
 iio_read_channel_info
 dev_attr_show

The buggy address belongs to the variable:
 afe4403_channel_leds+0x18/0xffffffffffffe9e0

This issue can be reproduced by singe command:

 $ cat /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi0.0/iio\:device0/in_intensity6_raw

The array size of afe4403_channel_leds is less than channels, so access
with chan->address cause OOB read in afe4403_read_raw. Fix it by moving
access before use it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49031 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
