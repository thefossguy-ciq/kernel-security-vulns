Subject: CVE-2022-50839: jbd2: fix potential buffer head reference count leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: fix potential buffer head reference count leak

As in 'jbd2_fc_wait_bufs' if buffer isn't uptodate, will return -EIO without
update 'journal->j_fc_off'. But 'jbd2_fc_release_bufs' will release buffer head
from ‘j_fc_off - 1’ if 'bh' is NULL will terminal release which will lead to
buffer head buffer head reference count leak.
To solve above issue, update 'journal->j_fc_off' before return -EIO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
