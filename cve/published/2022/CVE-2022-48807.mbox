Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler

Currently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO
LAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is
causing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has
a different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem
manifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.

Fix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only
is passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the
NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.

Also included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev
and related braces.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48807 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f9daedc3ab8f673e3a9374b91a89fbf1174df469
