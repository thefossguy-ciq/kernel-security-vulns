Subject: CVE-2022-50847: drm/bridge: it6505: Initialize AUX channel in it6505_i2c_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: it6505: Initialize AUX channel in it6505_i2c_probe

During device boot, the HPD interrupt could be triggered before the DRM
subsystem registers it6505 as a DRM bridge. In such cases, the driver
tries to access AUX channel and causes NULL pointer dereference.
Initializing the AUX channel earlier to prevent such error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50847 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
