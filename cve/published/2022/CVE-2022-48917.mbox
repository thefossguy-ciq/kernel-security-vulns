Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: ops: Shift tested values in snd_soc_put_volsw() by +min

While the $val/$val2 values passed in from userspace are always >= 0
integers, the limits of the control can be signed integers and the $min
can be non-zero and less than zero. To correctly validate $val/$val2
against platform_max, add the $min offset to val first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
