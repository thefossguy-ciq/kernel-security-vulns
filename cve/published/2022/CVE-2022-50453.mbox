Subject: CVE-2022-50453: gpiolib: cdev: fix NULL-pointer dereferences

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: fix NULL-pointer dereferences

There are several places where we can crash the kernel by requesting
lines, unbinding the GPIO device, then calling any of the system calls
relevant to the GPIO character device's annonymous file descriptors:
ioctl(), read(), poll().

While I observed it with the GPIO simulator, it will also happen for any
of the GPIO devices that can be hot-unplugged - for instance any HID GPIO
expander (e.g. CP2112).

This affects both v1 and v2 uAPI.

This fixes it partially by checking if gdev->chip is not NULL but it
doesn't entirely remedy the situation as we still have a race condition
in which another thread can remove the device after the check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50453 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
