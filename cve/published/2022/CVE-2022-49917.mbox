Subject: CVE-2022-49917: ipvs: fix WARNING in ip_vs_app_net_cleanup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvs: fix WARNING in ip_vs_app_net_cleanup()

During the initialization of ip_vs_app_net_init(), if file ip_vs_app
fails to be created, the initialization is successful by default.
Therefore, the ip_vs_app file doesn't be found during the remove in
ip_vs_app_net_cleanup(). It will cause WRNING.

The following is the stack information:
name 'ip_vs_app'

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
