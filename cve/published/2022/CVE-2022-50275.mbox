Subject: CVE-2022-50275: drm/radeon: Add the missed acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: Add the missed acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak

When the radeon driver reads the bios information from ACPI
table in radeon_acpi_vfct_bios(), it misses to call acpi_put_table()
to release the ACPI memory after the init, so add acpi_put_table()
properly to fix the memory leak.

v2: fix text formatting (Alex)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50275 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
