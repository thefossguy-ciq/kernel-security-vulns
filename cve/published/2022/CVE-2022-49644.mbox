Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: fix a possible refcount leak in intel_dp_add_mst_connector()

If drm_connector_init fails, intel_connector_free will be called to take
care of proper free. So it is necessary to drop the refcount of port
before intel_connector_free.

(cherry picked from commit cea9ed611e85d36a05db52b6457bf584b7d969e2)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49644 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
