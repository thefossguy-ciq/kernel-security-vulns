Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpasim: fix memory leak when freeing IOTLBs

After commit bda324fd037a ("vdpasim: control virtqueue support"),
vdpasim->iommu became an array of IOTLB, so we should clean the
mappings of each free one by one instead of just deleting the ranges
in the first IOTLB which may leak maps.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50263 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/54b210c90d2803a9f1c8fd2f0d08e90172e9a06d
