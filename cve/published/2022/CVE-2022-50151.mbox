Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: fix random warning message when driver load

Warning log:
[    4.141392] Unexpected gfp: 0x4 (GFP_DMA32). Fixing up to gfp: 0xa20 (GFP_ATOMIC). Fix your code!
[    4.150340] CPU: 1 PID: 175 Comm: 1-0050 Not tainted 5.15.5-00039-g2fd9ae1b568c #20

pool_alloc_page(struct dma_pool *pool, gfp_t mem_flags)
{
	...
	page = kmalloc(sizeof(*page), mem_flags);
	page->vaddr = dma_alloc_coherent(pool->dev, pool->allocation,
					 &page->dma, mem_flags);
	...
}

kmalloc was called with mem_flags, which is passed down in
cdns3_allocate_trb_pool() and have GFP_DMA32 flags.
kmall_fix_flags() report warning.

GFP_DMA32 is not useful at all. dma_alloc_coherent() will handle
DMA memory region correctly by pool->dev. GFP_DMA32 can be removed
safely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50151 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
