Subject: CVE-2022-50715: md/raid1: stop mdx_raid1 thread when raid1 array run failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid1: stop mdx_raid1 thread when raid1 array run failed

fail run raid1 array when we assemble array with the inactive disk only,
but the mdx_raid1 thread were not stop, Even if the associated resources
have been released. it will caused a NULL dereference when we do poweroff.

This causes the following Oops:
    [  287.587787] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000070

In fact, when raid1 array run fail, we need to do
md_unregister_thread() before raid1_free().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
