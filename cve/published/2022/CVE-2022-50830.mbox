Subject: CVE-2022-50830: auxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

auxdisplay: hd44780: Fix potential memory leak in hd44780_remove()

hd44780_probe() allocates a memory chunk for hd with kzalloc() and
makes "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" point to it. When we call hd44780_remove(),
we should release all relevant memory and resource. But "lcd->drvdata
->hd44780" is not released, which will lead to a memory leak.

We should release the "lcd->drvdata->hd44780" in hd44780_remove() to fix
the memory leak bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50830 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
