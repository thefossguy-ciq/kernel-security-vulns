Subject: CVE-2022-50383: media: mediatek: vcodec: Can't set dst buffer to done when lat decode error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: Can't set dst buffer to done when lat decode error

Core thread will call v4l2_m2m_buf_done to set dst buffer done for
lat architecture. If lat call v4l2_m2m_buf_done_and_job_finish to
free dst buffer when lat decode error, core thread will access kernel
NULL pointer dereference, then crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50383 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
