Subject: CVE-2022-50017: mips: cavium-octeon: Fix missing of_node_put() in octeon2_usb_clocks_start

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mips: cavium-octeon: Fix missing of_node_put() in octeon2_usb_clocks_start

We should call of_node_put() for the reference 'uctl_node' returned by
of_get_parent() which will increase the refcount. Otherwise, there will
be a refcount leak bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
