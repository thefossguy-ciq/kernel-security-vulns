Subject: CVE-2022-50361: wifi: wilc1000: add missing unregister_netdev() in wilc_netdev_ifc_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wilc1000: add missing unregister_netdev() in wilc_netdev_ifc_init()

Fault injection test reports this issue:

kernel BUG at net/core/dev.c:10731!
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
Call Trace:

The root case here is alloc_ordered_workqueue() fails, but
cfg80211_unregister_netdevice() or unregister_netdev() not be called in
error handling path. To fix add unregister_netdev goto lable to add the
unregister operation in error handling path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50361 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
