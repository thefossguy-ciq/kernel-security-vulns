Subject: CVE-2022-50366: powercap: intel_rapl: fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powercap: intel_rapl: fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue

When value < time_unit, the parameter of ilog2() will be zero and
the return value is -1. u64(-1) is too large for shift exponent
and then will trigger shift-out-of-bounds:

shift exponent 18446744073709551615 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
Call Trace:
 rapl_compute_time_window_core
 rapl_write_data_raw
 set_time_window
 store_constraint_time_window_us

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50366 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
