Subject: CVE-2022-50142: intel_th: msu: Fix vmalloced buffers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

intel_th: msu: Fix vmalloced buffers

After commit f5ff79fddf0e ("dma-mapping: remove CONFIG_DMA_REMAP") there's
a chance of DMA buffer getting allocated via vmalloc(), which messes up
the mmapping code:

> RIP: msc_mmap_fault [intel_th_msu]
> Call Trace:
>  <TASK>
>  __do_fault
>  do_fault
...

Fix this by accounting for vmalloc possibility.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50142 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
