Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: Replace kcalloc() with kvzalloc()

In order to reduce chance of allocation failure while capturing a6xx
gpu state, use kvzalloc() instead of kcalloc() in state_kcalloc().

Indirectly, this patch helps to fix leaking memory allocated for
gmu_debug object.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ecd63b2fbabc8fd6e5355c25fe1e186a74fa5272
