Subject: CVE-2022-50867: drm/msm/a6xx: Fix kvzalloc vs state_kcalloc usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: Fix kvzalloc vs state_kcalloc usage

adreno_show_object() is a trap!  It will re-allocate the pointer it is
passed on first call, when the data is ascii85 encoded, using kvmalloc/
kvfree().  Which means the data *passed* to it must be kvmalloc'd, ie.
we cannot use the state_kcalloc() helper.

This partially reverts commit ec8f1813bf8d ("drm/msm/a6xx: Replace
kcalloc() with kvzalloc()"), but adds the missing kvfree() to fix the
memory leak that was present previously.  And adds a warning comment.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b1bbc0571a5d7ee10f754186dc3d619b9ced5c1
