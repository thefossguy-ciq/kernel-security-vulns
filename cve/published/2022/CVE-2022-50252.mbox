Subject: CVE-2022-50252: igb: Do not free q_vector unless new one was allocated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Do not free q_vector unless new one was allocated

Avoid potential use-after-free condition under memory pressure. If the
kzalloc() fails, q_vector will be freed but left in the original
adapter->q_vector[v_idx] array position.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50252 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
