Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: Prevent integer underflow

By using a ratio of delay to poll_enabled_time that is not integer
time_remaining underflows and does not exit the loop as expected.
As delay could be derived from DT and poll_enabled_time is defined
in the driver this can easily happen.

Use a signed iterator to make sure that the loop exits once
the remaining time is negative.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50582 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
