In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix the assign logic of iocb

commit 18ae8d12991b ("f2fs: show more DIO information in tracepoint")
introduces iocb field in 'f2fs_direct_IO_enter' trace event
And it only assigns the pointer and later it accesses its field
in trace print log.

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffc04cef3d30

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
