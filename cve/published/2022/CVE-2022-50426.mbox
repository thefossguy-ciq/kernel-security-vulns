Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: imx_dsp_rproc: Add mutex protection for workqueue

The workqueue may execute late even after remoteproc is stopped or
stopping, some resources (rpmsg device and endpoint) have been
released in rproc_stop_subdevices(), then rproc_vq_interrupt()
accessing these resources will cause kennel dump.

Call trace:
 virtqueue_add_split+0x1ac/0x560
 virtqueue_add_inbuf+0x4c/0x60
 rpmsg_recv_done+0x15c/0x294
 vring_interrupt+0x6c/0xa4
 rproc_vq_interrupt+0x30/0x50
 imx_dsp_rproc_vq_work+0x24/0x40 [imx_dsp_rproc]
 process_one_work+0x1d0/0x354
 worker_thread+0x13c/0x470
 kthread+0x154/0x160
 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

Add mutex protection in imx_dsp_rproc_vq_work(), if the state is
not running, then just skip calling rproc_vq_interrupt().

Also the flush workqueue operation can't be added in rproc stop
for the same reason. The call sequence is

rproc_shutdown
-> rproc_stop
   ->rproc_stop_subdevices
   ->rproc->ops->stop()
     ->imx_dsp_rproc_stop
       ->flush_work
         -> rproc_vq_interrupt

The resource needed by rproc_vq_interrupt has been released in
rproc_stop_subdevices, so flush_work is not safe to be called in
imx_dsp_rproc_stop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50426 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a3e1fa7a77838617bdbcd95127ce93a959fad44
