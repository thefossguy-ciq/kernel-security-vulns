Subject: CVE-2022-50542: media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()

syzbot reported use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback() [1].  This
indicates that urb->context, which contains struct si470x_device
object, is freed when si470x_int_in_callback() is called.

The cause of this issue is that si470x_int_in_callback() is called for
freed urb.

si470x_usb_driver_probe() calls si470x_start_usb(), which then calls
usb_submit_urb() and si470x_start().  If si470x_start_usb() fails,
si470x_usb_driver_probe() doesn't kill urb, but it just frees struct
si470x_device object, as depicted below:

si470x_usb_driver_probe()
  ...
  si470x_start_usb()
    ...
    usb_submit_urb()
    retval = si470x_start()
    return retval
  if (retval < 0)
    free struct si470x_device object, but don't kill urb

This patch fixes this issue by killing urb when si470x_start_usb()
fails and urb is submitted.  If si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is
not submitted, i.e. submitting usb fails, it just frees struct
si470x_device object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50542 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
