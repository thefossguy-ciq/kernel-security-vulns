Subject: CVE-2022-50130: staging: fbtft: core: set smem_len before fb_deferred_io_init call

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: fbtft: core: set smem_len before fb_deferred_io_init call

The fbtft_framebuffer_alloc() calls fb_deferred_io_init() before
initializing info->fix.smem_len.  It is set to zero by the
framebuffer_alloc() function.  It will trigger a WARN_ON() at the
start of fb_deferred_io_init() and the function will not do anything.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
