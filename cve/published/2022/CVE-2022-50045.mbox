Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pci: Fix get_phb_number() locking

The recent change to get_phb_number() causes a DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP
warning on some systems:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:580
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 1, name: swapper

  [d101df30] [c001b334] ret_from_kernel_thread+0x5c/0x64

This is because pcibios_alloc_controller() holds hose_spinlock but
of_alias_get_id() takes of_mutex which can sleep.

The hose_spinlock protects the phb_bitmap, and also the hose_list, but
it doesn't need to be held while get_phb_number() calls the OF routines,
because those are only looking up information in the device tree.

So fix it by having get_phb_number() take the hose_spinlock itself, only
where required, and then dropping the lock before returning.
pcibios_alloc_controller() then needs to take the lock again before the
list_add() but that's safe, the order of the list is not important.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
