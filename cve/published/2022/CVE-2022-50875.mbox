Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: overlay: fix null pointer dereferencing in find_dup_cset_node_entry() and find_dup_cset_prop()

When kmalloc() fail to allocate memory in kasprintf(), fn_1 or fn_2 will
be NULL, and strcmp() will cause null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50875 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
