Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: vt6655: fix potential memory leak

In function device_init_td0_ring, memory is allocated for member
td_info of priv->apTD0Rings[i], with i increasing from 0. In case of
allocation failure, the memory is freed in reversed order, with i
decreasing to 0. However, the case i=0 is left out and thus memory is
leaked.

Modify the memory freeing loop to include the case i=0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50758 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
