Subject: CVE-2022-49951: firmware_loader: Fix use-after-free during unregister

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Fix use-after-free during unregister

In the following code within firmware_upload_unregister(), the call to
device_unregister() could result in the dev_release function freeing the
fw_upload_priv structure before it is dereferenced for the call to
module_put(). This bug was found by the kernel test robot using
CONFIG_KASAN while running the firmware selftests.

  device_unregister(&fw_sysfs->dev);
  module_put(fw_upload_priv->module);

The problem is fixed by copying fw_upload_priv->module to a local variable
for use when calling device_unregister().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49951 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d380d40930a674c520a5b55f3be1eb17dc634ebc
