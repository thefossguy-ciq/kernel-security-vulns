Subject: CVE-2022-49919: netfilter: nf_tables: release flow rule object from commit path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: release flow rule object from commit path

No need to postpone this to the commit release path, since no packets
are walking over this object, this is accessed from control plane only.
This helped uncovered UAF triggered by races with the netlink notifier.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49919 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
