Subject: CVE-2022-50021: ext4: block range must be validated before use in ext4_mb_clear_bb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: block range must be validated before use in ext4_mb_clear_bb()

Block range to free is validated in ext4_free_blocks() using
ext4_inode_block_valid() and then it's passed to ext4_mb_clear_bb().
However in some situations on bigalloc file system the range might be
adjusted after the validation in ext4_free_blocks() which can lead to
troubles on corrupted file systems such as one found by syzkaller that
resulted in the following BUG

Fix it by making sure that the block range is properly validated before
used every time it changes in ext4_free_blocks() or ext4_mb_clear_bb().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
