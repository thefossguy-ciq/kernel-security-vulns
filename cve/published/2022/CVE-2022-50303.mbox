Subject: CVE-2022-50303: drm/amdkfd: Fix double release compute pasid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix double release compute pasid

If kfd_process_device_init_vm returns failure after vm is converted to
compute vm and vm->pasid set to compute pasid, KFD will not take
pdd->drm_file reference. As a result, drm close file handler maybe
called to release the compute pasid before KFD process destroy worker to
release the same pasid and set vm->pasid to zero, this generates below
WARNING backtrace and NULL pointer access.

Add helper amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm_set_vm_pasid and call it at the last step
of kfd_process_device_init_vm, to ensure vm pasid is the original pasid
if acquiring vm failed or is the compute pasid with pdd->drm_file
reference taken to avoid double release same pasid.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
