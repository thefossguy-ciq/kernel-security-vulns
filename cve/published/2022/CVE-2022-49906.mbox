Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Free rwi on reset success

Free the rwi structure in the event that the last rwi in the list
processed successfully. The logic in commit 4f408e1fa6e1 ("ibmvnic:
retry reset if there are no other resets") introduces an issue that
results in a 32 byte memory leak whenever the last rwi in the list
gets processed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49906 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
