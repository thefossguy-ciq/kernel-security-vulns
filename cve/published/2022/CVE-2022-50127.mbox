Subject: CVE-2022-50127: RDMA/rxe: Fix error unwind in rxe_create_qp()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix error unwind in rxe_create_qp()

In the function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to
initialize qp, internally things like the spin locks are not setup until
rxe_qp_init_req().

If an error occures before this point then the unwind will call
rxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()
which will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.

Move the spinlock initializations earlier before any failures.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50127 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
