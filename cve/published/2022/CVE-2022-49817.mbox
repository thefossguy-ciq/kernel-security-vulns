Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mhi: Fix memory leak in mhi_net_dellink()

MHI driver registers network device without setting the
needs_free_netdev flag, and does NOT call free_netdev() when
unregisters network device, which causes a memory leak.

This patch calls free_netdev() to fix it since netdev_priv
is used after unregister.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49817 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
