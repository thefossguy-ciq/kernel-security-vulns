Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

VMCI: Use threaded irqs instead of tasklets

The vmci_dispatch_dgs() tasklet function calls vmci_read_data()
which uses wait_event() resulting in invalid sleep in an atomic
context (and therefore potentially in a deadlock).

Use threaded irqs to fix this issue and completely remove usage
of tasklets.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/548ea9dd5e01b0ecf53d2563004c80abd636743d
