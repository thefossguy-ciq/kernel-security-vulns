Subject: CVE-2022-50468: platform/chrome: cros_usbpd_notify: Fix error handling in cros_usbpd_notify_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/chrome: cros_usbpd_notify: Fix error handling in cros_usbpd_notify_init()

The following WARNING message was given when rmmod cros_usbpd_notify:

 Unexpected driver unregister!
 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 253 at drivers/base/driver.c:270 driver_unregister+0x8a/0xb0
 Modules linked in: cros_usbpd_notify(-)

 RIP: 0033:0x7f333fe9b1b7

The reason is that the cros_usbpd_notify_init() does not check the return
value of platform_driver_register(), and the cros_usbpd_notify can
install successfully even if platform_driver_register() failed.

Fix by checking the return value of platform_driver_register() and
unregister cros_usbpd_notify_plat_driver when it failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50468 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
