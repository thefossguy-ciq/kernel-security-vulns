Subject: CVE-2022-50557: pinctrl: thunderbay: fix possible memory leak in thunderbay_build_functions()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: thunderbay: fix possible memory leak in thunderbay_build_functions()

The thunderbay_add_functions() will free memory of thunderbay_funcs
when everything is ok, but thunderbay_funcs will not be freed when
thunderbay_add_functions() fails, then there will be a memory leak,
so we need to add kfree() when thunderbay_add_functions() fails to
fix it.

In addition, doing some cleaner works, moving kfree(funcs) from
thunderbay_add_functions() to thunderbay_build_functions().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50557 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
