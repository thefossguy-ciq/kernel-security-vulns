Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: lapbether: fix issue of invalid opcode in lapbeth_open()

If lapb_register() failed when lapb device goes to up for the first time,
the NAPI is not disabled. As a result, the invalid opcode issue is
reported when the lapb device goes to up for the second time.

The stack info is as follows:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
