Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix percpu memory leak at nf_tables_addchain()

It seems to me that percpu memory for chain stats started leaking since
commit 3bc158f8d0330f0a ("netfilter: nf_tables: map basechain priority to
hardware priority") when nft_chain_offload_priority() returned an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48642 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
