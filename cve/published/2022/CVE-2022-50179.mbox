Subject: CVE-2022-50179: ath9k: fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath9k: fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb

Syzbot reported use-after-free Read in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb() [0]. The
problem was in incorrect htc_handle->drv_priv initialization.

Probable call trace which can trigger use-after-free:

ath9k_htc_probe_device()
  /* htc_handle->drv_priv = priv; */
  ath9k_htc_wait_for_target()      <--- Failed
  ieee80211_free_hw()		   <--- priv pointer is freed

<IRQ>
...
ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb()
  ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()
   RX_STAT_INC()		<--- htc_handle->drv_priv access

In order to not add fancy protection for drv_priv we can move
htc_handle->drv_priv initialization at the end of the
ath9k_htc_probe_device() and add helper macro to make
all *_STAT_* macros NULL safe, since syzbot has reported related NULL
deref in that macros [1]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50179 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
