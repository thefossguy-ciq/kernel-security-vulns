Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ena: Fix error handling in ena_init()

The ena_init() won't destroy workqueue created by
create_singlethread_workqueue() when pci_register_driver() failed.
Call destroy_workqueue() when pci_register_driver() failed to prevent the
resource leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49813 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
