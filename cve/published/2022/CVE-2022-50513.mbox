Subject: CVE-2022-50513: staging: rtl8723bs: fix a potential memory leak in rtw_init_cmd_priv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix a potential memory leak in rtw_init_cmd_priv()

In rtw_init_cmd_priv(), if `pcmdpriv->rsp_allocated_buf` is allocated
in failure, then `pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf` will be not properly
released. Besides, considering there are only two error paths and the
first one can directly return, so we do not need implicitly jump to the
`exit` tag to execute the error handler.

So this patch added `kfree(pcmdpriv->cmd_allocated_buf);` on the error
path to release the resource and simplified the return logic of
rtw_init_cmd_priv(). As there is no proper device to test with, no runtime
testing was performed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50513 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
