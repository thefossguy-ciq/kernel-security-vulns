Subject: CVE-2022-50505: iommu/amd: Fix pci device refcount leak in ppr_notifier()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Fix pci device refcount leak in ppr_notifier()

As comment of pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() says, it returns
a pci device with refcount increment, when finish using it,
the caller must decrement the reference count by calling
pci_dev_put(). So call it before returning from ppr_notifier()
to avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50505 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
