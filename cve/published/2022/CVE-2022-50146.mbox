Subject: CVE-2022-50146: PCI: dwc: Deallocate EPC memory on dw_pcie_ep_init() errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: dwc: Deallocate EPC memory on dw_pcie_ep_init() errors

If dw_pcie_ep_init() fails to perform any action after the EPC memory is
initialized and the MSI memory region is allocated, the latter parts won't
be undone thus causing a memory leak.  Add a cleanup-on-error path to fix
these leaks.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
