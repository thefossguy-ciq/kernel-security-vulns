Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mempolicy: fix memory leak in set_mempolicy_home_node system call

When encountering any vma in the range with policy other than MPOL_BIND or
MPOL_PREFERRED_MANY, an error is returned without issuing a mpol_put on
the policy just allocated with mpol_dup().

This allows arbitrary users to leak kernel memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50391 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ca0eb6b2f3add8c5daefb726ce57dc95d103d33
