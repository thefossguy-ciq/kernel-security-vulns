Subject: CVE-2022-49805: net: lan966x: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in lan966x_stats_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: lan966x: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in lan966x_stats_init()

lan966x_stats_init() calls create_singlethread_workqueue() and not
checked the ret value, which may return NULL. And a null-ptr-deref may
happen:

lan966x_stats_init()
    create_singlethread_workqueue() # failed, lan966x->stats_queue is NULL
    queue_delayed_work()
        queue_delayed_work_on()
            __queue_delayed_work()  # warning here, but continue
                __queue_work()      # access wq->flags, null-ptr-deref

Check the ret value and return -ENOMEM if it is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49805 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
