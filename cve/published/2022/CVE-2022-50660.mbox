Subject: CVE-2022-50660: wifi: ipw2200: fix memory leak in ipw_wdev_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ipw2200: fix memory leak in ipw_wdev_init()

In the error path of ipw_wdev_init(), exception value is returned, and
the memory applied for in the function is not released. Also the memory
is not released in ipw_pci_probe(). As a result, memory leakage occurs.
So memory release needs to be added to the error path of ipw_wdev_init().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50660 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
