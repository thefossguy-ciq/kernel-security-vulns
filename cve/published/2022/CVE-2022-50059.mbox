Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: don't leak snap_rwsem in handle_cap_grant

When handle_cap_grant is called on an IMPORT op, then the snap_rwsem is
held and the function is expected to release it before returning. It
currently fails to do that in all cases which could lead to a deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50059 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
