Subject: CVE-2022-50170: kunit: executor: Fix a memory leak on failure in kunit_filter_tests

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kunit: executor: Fix a memory leak on failure in kunit_filter_tests

It's possible that memory allocation for 'filtered' will fail, but for the
copy of the suite to succeed. In this case, the copy could be leaked.

Properly free 'copy' in the error case for the allocation of 'filtered'
failing.

Note that there may also have been a similar issue in
kunit_filter_subsuites, before it was removed in "kunit: flatten
kunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites".

This was reported by clang-analyzer via the kernel test robot, here:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
