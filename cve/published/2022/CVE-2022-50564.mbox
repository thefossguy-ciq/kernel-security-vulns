Subject: CVE-2022-50564: s390/netiucv: Fix return type of netiucv_tx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/netiucv: Fix return type of netiucv_tx()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/s390/net/netiucv.c:1854:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
          .ndo_start_xmit         = netiucv_tx,
                                    ^~~~~~~~~~

->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of netiucv_tx() to
match the prototype's to resolve the warning and potential CFI failure,
should s390 select ARCH_SUPPORTS_CFI_CLANG in the future.

Additionally, while in the area, remove a comment block that is no
longer relevant.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50564 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
