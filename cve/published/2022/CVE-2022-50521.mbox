Subject: CVE-2022-50521: platform/x86: mxm-wmi: fix memleak in mxm_wmi_call_mx[ds|mx]()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: mxm-wmi: fix memleak in mxm_wmi_call_mx[ds|mx]()

The ACPI buffer memory (out.pointer) returned by wmi_evaluate_method()
is not freed after the call, so it leads to memory leak.

The method results in ACPI buffer is not used, so just pass NULL to
wmi_evaluate_method() which fixes the memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50521 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
