Subject: CVE-2022-49741: fbdev: smscufx: fix error handling code in ufx_usb_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: smscufx: fix error handling code in ufx_usb_probe

The current error handling code in ufx_usb_probe have many unmatching
issues, e.g., missing ufx_free_usb_list, destroy_modedb label should
only include framebuffer_release, fb_dealloc_cmap only matches
fb_alloc_cmap.

My local syzkaller reports a memory leak bug:

memory leak in ufx_usb_probe

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
