Subject: CVE-2022-50156: HID: cp2112: prevent a buffer overflow in cp2112_xfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: cp2112: prevent a buffer overflow in cp2112_xfer()

Smatch warnings:
drivers/hid/hid-cp2112.c:793 cp2112_xfer() error: __memcpy()
'data->block[1]' too small (33 vs 255)
drivers/hid/hid-cp2112.c:793 cp2112_xfer() error: __memcpy() 'buf' too
small (64 vs 255)

The 'read_length' variable is provided by 'data->block[0]' which comes
from user and it(read_length) can take a value between 0-255. Add an
upper bound to 'read_length' variable to prevent a buffer overflow in
memcpy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50156 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
