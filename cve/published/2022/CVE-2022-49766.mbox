Subject: CVE-2022-49766: netlink: Bounds-check struct nlmsgerr creation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: Bounds-check struct nlmsgerr creation

In preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE doing bounds-check on memcpy(),
switch from __nlmsg_put to nlmsg_put(), and explain the bounds check
for dealing with the memcpy() across a composite flexible array struct.
Avoids this future run-time warning:

  memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 32) of single field "&errmsg->msg" at net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2447 (size 16)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49766 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aff4eb16f589c3af322a2582044bca365381fcd6
