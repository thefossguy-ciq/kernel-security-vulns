Subject: CVE-2022-50260: drm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Make .remove and .shutdown HW shutdown consistent

Drivers' .remove and .shutdown callbacks are executed on different code
paths. The former is called when a device is removed from the bus, while
the latter is called at system shutdown time to quiesce the device.

This means that some overlap exists between the two, because both have to
take care of properly shutting down the hardware. But currently the logic
used in these two callbacks isn't consistent in msm drivers, which could
lead to kernel panic.

For example, on .remove the component is deleted and its .unbind callback
leads to the hardware being shutdown but only if the DRM device has been
marked as registered.

That check doesn't exist in the .shutdown logic and this can lead to the
driver calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() for a DRM device that hasn't
been properly initialized.

A situation like this can happen if drivers for expected sub-devices fail
to probe, since the .bind callback will never be executed. If that is the
case, drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() will attempt to take mutexes that are
only initialized if drm_mode_config_init() is called during a device bind.

This bug was attempted to be fixed in commit 623f279c7781 ("drm/msm: fix
shutdown hook in case GPU components failed to bind"), but unfortunately
it still happens in some cases as the one mentioned above, i.e:

  systemd-shutdown[1]: Powering off.
  kvm: exiting hardware virtualization
  platform wifi-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 12
  platform video-firmware.0: Removing from iommu group 10

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
