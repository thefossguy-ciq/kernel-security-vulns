Subject: CVE-2022-49873: bpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix wrong reg type conversion in release_reference()

Some helper functions will allocate memory. To avoid memory leaks, the
verifier requires the eBPF program to release these memories by calling
the corresponding helper functions.

When a resource is released, all pointer registers corresponding to the
resource should be invalidated. The verifier use release_references() to
do this job, by apply  __mark_reg_unknown() to each relevant register.

It will give these registers the type of SCALAR_VALUE. A register that
will contain a pointer value at runtime, but of type SCALAR_VALUE, which
may allow the unprivileged user to get a kernel pointer by storing this
register into a map.

Using __mark_reg_not_init() while NOT allow_ptr_leaks can mitigate this
problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49873 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
