Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: qcom: q6v5: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in q6v5_wcss_init_mmio()

q6v5_wcss_init_mmio() will call platform_get_resource_byname() that may
fail and return NULL. devm_ioremap() will use res->start as input, which
may causes null-ptr-deref. Check the ret value of
platform_get_resource_byname() to avoid the null-ptr-deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50888 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
