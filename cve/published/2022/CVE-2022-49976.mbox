Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Fix broken touchscreen on Chuwi Hi8 with Windows BIOS

The x86-android-tablets handling for the Chuwi Hi8 is only necessary with
the Android BIOS and it is causing problems with the Windows BIOS version.

Specifically when trying to register the already present touchscreen
x86_acpi_irq_helper_get() calls acpi_unregister_gsi(), this breaks
the working of the touchscreen and also leads to an oops:

[   14.248946] ------------[ cut here ]------------

Add an init callback for the Chuwi Hi8, which detects when the Windows BIOS
is in use and exits with -ENODEV in that case, fixing this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49976 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/platform/x86/x86-android-tablets.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c77b724cddfb8ac1291a60e3e68937e62cbfc5e0
