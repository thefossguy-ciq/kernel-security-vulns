Subject: CVE-2022-50616: regulator: core: Use different devices for resource allocation and DT lookup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: Use different devices for resource allocation and DT lookup

Following by the below discussion, there's the potential UAF issue
between regulator and mfd.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20221128143601.1698148-1-yangyingliang@huawei.com/

From the analysis of Yingliang

CPU A				|CPU B
mt6370_probe()			|
  devm_mfd_add_devices()	|
				|mt6370_regulator_probe()
				|  regulator_register()
				|    //allocate init_data and add it to devres
				|    regulator_of_get_init_data()
i2c_unregister_device()		|
  device_del()			|
    devres_release_all()	|
      // init_data is freed	|
      release_nodes()		|
				|  // using init_data causes UAF
				|  regulator_register()

It's common to use mfd core to create child device for the regulator.
In order to do the DT lookup for init data, the child that registered
the regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes
init data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen
when parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing
some operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.

To fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the
different devices for init data allocation and DT lookup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50616 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
