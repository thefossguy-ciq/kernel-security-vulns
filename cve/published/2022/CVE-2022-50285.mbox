Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm,hugetlb: take hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages

The h->*_huge_pages counters are protected by the hugetlb_lock, but
alloc_huge_page has a corner case where it can decrement the counter
outside of the lock.

This could lead to a corrupted value of h->resv_huge_pages, which we have
observed on our systems.

Take the hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages to avoid a
potential race.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
