Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: use quiesced elevator switch when reinitializing queues

The hctx's run_work may be racing with the elevator switch when
reinitializing hardware queues. The queue is merely frozen in this
context, but that only prevents requests from allocating and doesn't
stop the hctx work from running. The work may get an elevator pointer
that's being torn down, and can result in use-after-free errors and
kernel panics (example below). Use the quiesced elevator switch instead,
and make the previous one static since it is now only used locally.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63a681bcc32a43528ce0f690569f7f48e59c3963
