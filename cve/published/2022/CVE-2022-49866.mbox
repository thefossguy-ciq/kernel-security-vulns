Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: mhi: fix memory leak in mhi_mbim_dellink

MHI driver registers network device without setting the
needs_free_netdev flag, and does NOT call free_netdev() when
unregisters network device, which causes a memory leak.

This patch sets needs_free_netdev to true when registers
network device, which makes netdev subsystem call free_netdev()
automatically after unregister_netdevice().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49866 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
