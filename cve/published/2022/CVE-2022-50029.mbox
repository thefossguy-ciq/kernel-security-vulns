Subject: CVE-2022-50029: clk: qcom: ipq8074: dont disable gcc_sleep_clk_src

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: ipq8074: dont disable gcc_sleep_clk_src

Once the usb sleep clocks are disabled, clock framework is trying to
disable the sleep clock source also.

However, it seems that it cannot be disabled and trying to do so produces:

So, add CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag to the clock so that the kernel won't try
to disable the sleep clock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50029 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
