Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cx88: Fix a null-ptr-deref bug in buffer_prepare()

When the driver calls cx88_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
function call may fail, resulting in a empty buffer and null-ptr-deref
later in buffer_queue().

The following log can reveal it:

[   41.822762] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
[   41.824488] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]

Fix this by checking the return value of cx88_risc_buffer()

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
