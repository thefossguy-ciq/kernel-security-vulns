Subject: CVE-2022-50622: ext4: fix potential memory leak in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix potential memory leak in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()

As krealloc may return NULL, in this case 'state->fc_modified_inodes'
may not be freed by krealloc, but 'state->fc_modified_inodes' already
set NULL. Then will lead to 'state->fc_modified_inodes' memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50622 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
