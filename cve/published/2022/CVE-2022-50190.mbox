Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: Fix simplification of devm_spi_register_controller

This reverts commit 59ebbe40fb51 ("spi: simplify
devm_spi_register_controller").

If devm_add_action() fails in devm_add_action_or_reset(),
devm_spi_unregister() will be called, it decreases the
refcount of 'ctlr->dev' to 0, then it will cause uaf in
the drivers that calling spi_put_controller() in error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50190 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
