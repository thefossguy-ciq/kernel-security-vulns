Subject: CVE-2022-50314: nbd: Fix hung when signal interrupts nbd_start_device_ioctl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: Fix hung when signal interrupts nbd_start_device_ioctl()

syzbot reported hung task [1].  The following program is a simplified
version of the reproducer:

int main(void)
{
	int sv[2], fd;

	if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sv) < 0)
		return 1;
	if ((fd = open("/dev/nbd0", 0)) < 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_SET_SIZE_BLOCKS, 0x81) < 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_SET_SOCK, sv[0]) < 0)
		return 1;
	if (ioctl(fd, NBD_DO_IT) < 0)
		return 1;
	return 0;
}

When signal interrupt nbd_start_device_ioctl() waiting the condition
atomic_read(&config->recv_threads) == 0, the task can hung because it
waits the completion of the inflight IOs.

This patch fixes the issue by clearing queue, not just shutdown, when
signal interrupt nbd_start_device_ioctl().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50314 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
