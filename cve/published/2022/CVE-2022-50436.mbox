Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: don't set up encryption key during jbd2 transaction

Commit a80f7fcf1867 ("ext4: fixup ext4_fc_track_* functions' signature")
extended the scope of the transaction in ext4_unlink() too far, making
it include the call to ext4_find_entry().  However, ext4_find_entry()
can deadlock when called from within a transaction because it may need
to set up the directory's encryption key.

Fix this by restoring the transaction to its original scope.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50436 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
