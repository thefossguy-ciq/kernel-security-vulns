Subject: CVE-2022-49742: f2fs: initialize locks earlier in f2fs_fill_super()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: initialize locks earlier in f2fs_fill_super()

syzbot is reporting lockdep warning at f2fs_handle_error() [1], for
spin_lock(&sbi->error_lock) is called before spin_lock_init() is called.
For safe locking in error handling, move initialization of locks (and
obvious structures) in f2fs_fill_super() to immediately after memory
allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49742 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
