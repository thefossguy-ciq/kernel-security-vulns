Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix possible memory leak in btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path()

In btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path(), btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb() can fail if
the path is invalid. In this case, btrfs_get_dev_args_from_path()
returns directly without freeing args->uuid and args->fsid allocated
before, which causes memory leak.

To fix these possible leaks, when btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb() fails,
btrfs_put_dev_args_from_path() is called to clean up the memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f52402c77013e4a826394b807dd5ea4dc83bd72
