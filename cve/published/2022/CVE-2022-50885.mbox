Subject: CVE-2022-50885: RDMA/rxe: Fix NULL-ptr-deref in rxe_qp_do_cleanup() when socket create failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix NULL-ptr-deref in rxe_qp_do_cleanup() when socket create failed

There is a null-ptr-deref when mount.cifs over rdma:

  BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in rxe_qp_do_cleanup+0x2f3/0x360 [rdma_rxe]
  Read of size 8 at addr 0000000000000018 by task mount.cifs/3046

  CPU: 2 PID: 3046 Comm: mount.cifs Not tainted 6.1.0-rc5+ #62
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-1.fc3

   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

The root cause of the issue is the socket create failed in
rxe_qp_init_req().

So move the reset rxe_qp_do_cleanup() after the NULL ptr check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50885 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
