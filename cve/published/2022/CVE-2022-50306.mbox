Subject: CVE-2022-50306: ext4: fix potential out of bound read in ext4_fc_replay_scan()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix potential out of bound read in ext4_fc_replay_scan()

For scan loop must ensure that at least EXT4_FC_TAG_BASE_LEN space. If remain
space less than EXT4_FC_TAG_BASE_LEN which will lead to out of bound read
when mounting corrupt file system image.
ADD_RANGE/HEAD/TAIL is needed to add extra check when do journal scan, as this
three tags will read data during scan, tag length couldn't less than data length
which will read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50306 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
