Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hid-thrustmaster: fix OOB read in thrustmaster_interrupts

Syzbot reported an slab-out-of-bounds Read in thrustmaster_probe() bug.
The root case is in missing validation check of actual number of endpoints.

Code should not blindly access usb_host_interface::endpoint array, since
it may contain less endpoints than code expects.

Fix it by adding missing validaion check and print an error if
number of endpoints do not match expected number

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48866 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
