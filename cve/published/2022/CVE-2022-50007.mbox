Subject: CVE-2022-50007: xfrm: fix refcount leak in __xfrm_policy_check()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: fix refcount leak in __xfrm_policy_check()

The issue happens on an error path in __xfrm_policy_check(). When the
fetching process of the object `pols[1]` fails, the function simply
returns 0, forgetting to decrement the reference count of `pols[0]`,
which is incremented earlier by either xfrm_sk_policy_lookup() or
xfrm_policy_lookup(). This may result in memory leaks.

Fix it by decreasing the reference count of `pols[0]` in that path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50007 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
