Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net, neigh: Fix null-ptr-deref in neigh_table_clear()

When IPv6 module gets initialized but hits an error in the middle,
kenel panic with:

KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000598-0x000000000000059f]
CPU: 1 PID: 361 Comm: insmod
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)
RIP: 0010:__neigh_ifdown.isra.0+0x24b/0x370
RSP: 0018:ffff888012677908 EFLAGS: 00000202
...
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 neigh_table_clear+0x94/0x2d0
 ndisc_cleanup+0x27/0x40 [ipv6]
 inet6_init+0x21c/0x2cb [ipv6]
 do_one_initcall+0xd3/0x4d0
 do_init_module+0x1ae/0x670
...
Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

When ipv6 initialization fails, it will try to cleanup and calls:

neigh_table_clear()
  neigh_ifdown(tbl, NULL)
    pneigh_queue_purge(&tbl->proxy_queue, dev_net(dev == NULL))
    # dev_net(NULL) triggers null-ptr-deref.

Fix it by passing NULL to pneigh_queue_purge() in neigh_ifdown() if dev
is NULL, to make kernel not panic immediately.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49904 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
