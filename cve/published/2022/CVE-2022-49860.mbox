Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-glue: fix memory leak when register device fail

If device_register() fails, it should call put_device() to give
up reference, the name allocated in dev_set_name() can be freed
in callback function kobject_cleanup().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49860 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
