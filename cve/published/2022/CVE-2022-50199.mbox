Subject: CVE-2022-50199: ARM: OMAP2+: Fix refcount leak in omapdss_init_of

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: OMAP2+: Fix refcount leak in omapdss_init_of

omapdss_find_dss_of_node() calls of_find_compatible_node() to get device
node. of_find_compatible_node() returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented, we should use of_node_put() on it when done.
Add missing of_node_put() in later error path and normal path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50199 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
