Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool

When the user changes the number of queues via ethtool, the driver
allocates new rings. This allocation did not initialize tx_tstamps. This
results in the tx_tstamps field being zero (due to kcalloc allocation), and
would result in a NULL pointer dereference when attempting a transmit
timestamp on the new ring.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50710 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
