Subject: CVE-2022-49938: cifs: fix small mempool leak in SMB2_negotiate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix small mempool leak in SMB2_negotiate()

In some cases of failure (dialect mismatches) in SMB2_negotiate(), after
the request is sent, the checks would return -EIO when they should be
rather setting rc = -EIO and jumping to neg_exit to free the response
buffer from mempool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
