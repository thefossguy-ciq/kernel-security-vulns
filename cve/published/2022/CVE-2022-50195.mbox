Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: dts: qcom: replace gcc PXO with pxo_board fixed clock

Replace gcc PXO phandle to pxo_board fixed clock declared in the dts.
gcc driver doesn't provide PXO_SRC as it's a fixed-clock. This cause a
kernel panic if any driver actually try to use it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50195 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a4fa4ce697987b71eafce17bb198961ed9070bd
