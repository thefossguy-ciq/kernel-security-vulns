Subject: CVE-2022-50825: usb: typec: wusb3801: fix fwnode refcount leak in wusb3801_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: wusb3801: fix fwnode refcount leak in wusb3801_probe()

I got the following report while doing fault injection test:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 4,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:
  attach overlay node /i2c/tcpc@60/connector

If wusb3801_hw_init() fails, fwnode_handle_put() needs be called to
avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50825 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
