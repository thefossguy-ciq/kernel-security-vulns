Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Don't finalize CSA in IBSS mode if state is disconnected

When we are not connected to a channel, sending channel "switch"
announcement doesn't make any sense.

The BSS list is empty in that case. This causes the for loop in
cfg80211_get_bss() to be bypassed, so the function returns NULL
(check line 1424 of net/wireless/scan.c), causing the WARN_ON()
in ieee80211_ibss_csa_beacon() to get triggered (check line 500
of net/mac80211/ibss.c), which was consequently reported on the
syzkaller dashboard.

Thus, check if we have an existing connection before generating
the CSA beacon in ieee80211_ibss_finish_csa().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49942 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
