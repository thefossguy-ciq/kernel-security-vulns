Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: fix a signed-integer-overflow bug in tcp_add_backlog()

The type of sk_rcvbuf and sk_sndbuf in struct sock is int, and
in tcp_add_backlog(), the variable limit is caculated by adding
sk_rcvbuf, sk_sndbuf and 64 * 1024, it may exceed the max value
of int and overflow. This patch reduces the limit budget by
halving the sndbuf to solve this issue since ACK packets are much
smaller than the payload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50865 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
