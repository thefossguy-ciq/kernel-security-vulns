Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix memory leak in vmw_mksstat_add_ioctl()

If the copy of the description string from userspace fails, then the page
for the instance descriptor doesn't get freed before returning -EFAULT,
which leads to a memleak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
