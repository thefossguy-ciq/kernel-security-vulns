Subject: CVE-2022-50767: fbdev: smscufx: Fix several use-after-free bugs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: smscufx: Fix several use-after-free bugs

Several types of UAFs can occur when physically removing a USB device.

Adds ufx_ops_destroy() function to .fb_destroy of fb_ops, and
in this function, there is kref_put() that finally calls ufx_free().

This fix prevents multiple UAFs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50767 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
