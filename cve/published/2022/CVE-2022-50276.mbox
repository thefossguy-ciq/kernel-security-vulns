Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: fix null pointer dereferencing in power_supply_get_battery_info

when kmalloc() fail to allocate memory in kasprintf(), propname
will be NULL, strcmp() called by of_get_property() will cause
null pointer dereference.

So return ENOMEM if kasprintf() return NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
