Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: qrtr: start MHI channel after endpoit creation

MHI channel may generates event/interrupt right after enabling.
It may leads to 2 race conditions issues.

1)
Such event may be dropped by qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback() at check:

	if (!qdev || mhi_res->transaction_status)
		return;

Because dev_set_drvdata(&mhi_dev->dev, qdev) may be not performed at
this moment. In this situation qrtr-ns will be unable to enumerate
services in device.
---------------------------------------------------------------

2)
Such event may come at the moment after dev_set_drvdata() and
before qrtr_endpoint_register(). In this case kernel will panic with
accessing wrong pointer at qcom_mhi_qrtr_dl_callback():

	rc = qrtr_endpoint_post(&qdev->ep, mhi_res->buf_addr,
				mhi_res->bytes_xferd);

Because endpoint is not created yet.
--------------------------------------------------------------
So move mhi_prepare_for_transfer_autoqueue after endpoint creation
to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c682fb70a7dfc25b848a4ff3a385b0471b470606
