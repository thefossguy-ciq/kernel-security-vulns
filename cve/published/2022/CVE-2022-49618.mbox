Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: aspeed: Fix potential NULL dereference in aspeed_pinmux_set_mux()

pdesc could be null but still dereference pdesc->name and it will lead to
a null pointer access. So we move a null check before dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49618 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
