Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RISC-V: kexec: Fix memory leak of fdt buffer

This is reported by kmemleak detector:

unreferenced object 0xff60000082864000 (size 9588):
  comm "kexec", pid 146, jiffies 4294900634 (age 64.788s)

In elf_kexec_load(), a buffer is allocated via kvmalloc() to store fdt.
While it's not freed back to system when kexec kernel is reloaded or
unloaded.  Then memory leak is caused.  Fix it by introducing riscv
specific function arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup(), and freeing the
buffer there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50631 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
