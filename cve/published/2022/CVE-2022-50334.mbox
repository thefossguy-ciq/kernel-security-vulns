Subject: CVE-2022-50334: hugetlbfs: fix null-ptr-deref in hugetlbfs_parse_param()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hugetlbfs: fix null-ptr-deref in hugetlbfs_parse_param()

Syzkaller reports a null-ptr-deref bug as follows:

======================================================

According to commit "vfs: parse: deal with zero length string value",
kernel will set the param->string to null pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string()
if fs string has zero length.

Yet the problem is that, hugetlbfs_parse_param() will dereference the
param->string, without checking whether it is a null pointer.  To be more
specific, if hugetlbfs_parse_param() parses an illegal mount parameter,
such as "size=,", kernel will constructs struct fs_parameter with null
pointer in vfs_parse_fs_string(), then passes this struct fs_parameter to
hugetlbfs_parse_param(), which triggers the above null-ptr-deref bug.

This patch solves it by adding sanity check on param->string
in hugetlbfs_parse_param().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50334 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
