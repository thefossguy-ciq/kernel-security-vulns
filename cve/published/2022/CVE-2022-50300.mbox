Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix extent map use-after-free when handling missing device in read_one_chunk

Store the error code before freeing the extent_map. Though it's
reference counted structure, in that function it's the first and last
allocation so this would lead to a potential use-after-free.

The error can happen eg. when chunk is stored on a missing device and
the degraded mount option is missing.

Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216721

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50300 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
