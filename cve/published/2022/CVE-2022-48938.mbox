Subject: CVE-2022-48938: CDC-NCM: avoid overflow in sanity checking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

CDC-NCM: avoid overflow in sanity checking

A broken device may give an extreme offset like 0xFFF0
and a reasonable length for a fragment. In the sanity
check as formulated now, this will create an integer
overflow, defeating the sanity check. Both offset
and offset + len need to be checked in such a manner
that no overflow can occur.
And those quantities should be unsigned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
