Subject: CVE-2022-49949: firmware_loader: Fix memory leak in firmware upload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Fix memory leak in firmware upload

In the case of firmware-upload, an instance of struct fw_upload is
allocated in firmware_upload_register(). This data needs to be freed
in fw_dev_release(). Create a new fw_upload_free() function in
sysfs_upload.c to handle the firmware-upload specific memory frees
and incorporate the missing kfree call for the fw_upload structure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49949 to this issue.

	drivers/base/firmware_loader/sysfs_upload.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
