Subject: CVE-2022-50860: apparmor: Fix memleak in alloc_ns()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

apparmor: Fix memleak in alloc_ns()

After changes in commit a1bd627b46d1 ("apparmor: share profile name on
replacement"), the hname member of struct aa_policy is not valid slab
object, but a subset of that, it can not be freed by kfree_sensitive(),
use aa_policy_destroy() to fix it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
