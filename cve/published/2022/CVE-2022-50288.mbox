Subject: CVE-2022-50288: qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure

adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in
case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens
under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both
of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained
pointer, which is potentially freed at that point.

Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb
pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now
unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around
kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE
static analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50288 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
