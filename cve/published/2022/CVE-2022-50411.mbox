Subject: CVE-2022-50411: ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()

A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of
acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code
inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by
acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped
from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new
walk state which is incorrect.

To address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call
acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before
returning an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50411 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
