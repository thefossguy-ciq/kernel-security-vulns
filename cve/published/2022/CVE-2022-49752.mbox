Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

device property: fix of node refcount leak in fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint()

The 'parent' returned by fwnode_graph_get_port_parent()
with refcount incremented when 'prev' is not NULL, it
needs be put when finish using it.

Because the parent is const, introduce a new variable to
store the returned fwnode, then put it before returning
from fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49752 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
