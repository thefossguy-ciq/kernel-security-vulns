Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm raid: fix address sanitizer warning in raid_resume

There is a KASAN warning in raid_resume when running the lvm test
lvconvert-raid.sh. The reason for the warning is that mddev->raid_disks
is greater than rs->raid_disks, so the loop touches one entry beyond
the allocated length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
