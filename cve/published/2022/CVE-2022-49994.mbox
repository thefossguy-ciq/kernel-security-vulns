Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bootmem: remove the vmemmap pages from kmemleak in put_page_bootmem

The vmemmap pages is marked by kmemleak when allocated from memblock. 
Remove it from kmemleak when freeing the page.  Otherwise, when we reuse
the page, kmemleak may report such an error and then stop working.

 kmemleak: Cannot insert 0xffff98fb6eab3d40 into the object search tree (overlaps existing)
 kmemleak: Kernel memory leak detector disabled
 kmemleak: Object 0xffff98fb6be00000 (size 335544320):
 kmemleak:   comm "swapper", pid 0, jiffies 4294892296
 kmemleak:   min_count = 0
 kmemleak:   count = 0
 kmemleak:   flags = 0x1
 kmemleak:   checksum = 0
 kmemleak:   backtrace:

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
