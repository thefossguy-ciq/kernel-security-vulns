Subject: CVE-2022-49984: HID: steam: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in steam_{recv,send}_report

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: steam: Prevent NULL pointer dereference in steam_{recv,send}_report

It is possible for a malicious device to forgo submitting a Feature
Report.  The HID Steam driver presently makes no prevision for this
and de-references the 'struct hid_report' pointer obtained from the
HID devices without first checking its validity.  Let's change that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49984 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
