Subject: CVE-2022-50578: class: fix possible memory leak in __class_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

class: fix possible memory leak in __class_register()

If class_add_groups() returns error, the 'cp->subsys' need be
unregister, and the 'cp' need be freed.

We can not call kset_unregister() here, because the 'cls' will
be freed in callback function class_release() and it's also
freed in caller's error path, it will cause double free.

So fix this by calling kobject_del() and kfree_const(name) to
cleanup kobject. Besides, call kfree() to free the 'cp'.

Fault injection test can trigger this:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
