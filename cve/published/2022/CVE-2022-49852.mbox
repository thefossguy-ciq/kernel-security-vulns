Subject: CVE-2022-49852: riscv: process: fix kernel info leakage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: process: fix kernel info leakage

thread_struct's s[12] may contain random kernel memory content, which
may be finally leaked to userspace. This is a security hole. Fix it
by clearing the s[12] array in thread_struct when fork.

As for kthread case, it's better to clear the s[12] array as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49852 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
