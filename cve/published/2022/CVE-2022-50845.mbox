Subject: CVE-2022-50845: ext4: fix inode leak in ext4_xattr_inode_create() on an error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix inode leak in ext4_xattr_inode_create() on an error path

There is issue as follows when do setxattr with inject fault:

[localhost]# fsck.ext4  -fn  /dev/sda
e2fsck 1.46.6-rc1 (12-Sep-2022)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Unattached zero-length inode 15.  Clear? no

Unattached inode 15
Connect to /lost+found? no

Pass 5: Checking group summary information

/dev/sda: ********** WARNING: Filesystem still has errors **********

/dev/sda: 15/655360 files (0.0% non-contiguous), 66755/2621440 blocks

This occurs in 'ext4_xattr_inode_create()'. If 'ext4_mark_inode_dirty()'
fails, dropping i_nlink of the inode is needed. Or will lead to inode leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50845 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
