Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netdevsim: Fix memory leak of nsim_dev->fa_cookie

kmemleak reports this issue:

unreferenced object 0xffff8881bac872d0 (size 8):
  comm "sh", pid 58603, jiffies 4481524462 (age 68.065s)
  hex dump (first 8 bytes):

  backtrace:
    [<00000000c80b8577>] __kmalloc+0x49/0x150
    [<000000005292b8c6>] nsim_dev_trap_fa_cookie_write+0xc1/0x210 [netdevsim]

    [<000000006001c6ec>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd

The issue occurs in the following scenarios:

nsim_dev_trap_fa_cookie_write()
  kmalloc() fa_cookie
  nsim_dev->fa_cookie = fa_cookie
..
nsim_drv_remove()

The fa_cookie allocked in nsim_dev_trap_fa_cookie_write() is not freed. To
fix, add kfree(nsim_dev->fa_cookie) to nsim_drv_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49803 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/207edad5717e0a5709ce8467f0eff41c607835c9
