Subject: CVE-2022-49771: dm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading

__list_versions will first estimate the required space using the
"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_needed, &needed)" call and then will
fill the space using the "dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_info,
&iter_info)" call. Each of these calls locks the targets using the
"down_read(&_lock)" and "up_read(&_lock)" calls, however between the first
and second "dm_target_iterate" there is no lock held and the target
modules can be loaded at this point, so the second "dm_target_iterate"
call may need more space than what was the first "dm_target_iterate"
returned.

The code tries to handle this overflow (see the beginning of
list_version_get_info), however this handling is incorrect.

The code sets "param->data_size = param->data_start + needed" and
"iter_info.end = (char *)vers+len" - "needed" is the size returned by the
first dm_target_iterate call; "len" is the size of the buffer allocated by
userspace.

"len" may be greater than "needed"; in this case, the code will write up
to "len" bytes into the buffer, however param->data_size is set to
"needed", so it may write data past the param->data_size value. The ioctl
interface copies only up to param->data_size into userspace, thus part of
the result will be truncated.

Fix this bug by setting "iter_info.end = (char *)vers + needed;" - this
guarantees that the second "dm_target_iterate" call will write only up to
the "needed" buffer and it will exit with "DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG" if it
overflows the "needed" space - in this case, userspace will allocate a
larger buffer and retry.

Note that there is also a bug in list_version_get_needed - we need to add
"strlen(tt->name) + 1" to the needed size, not "strlen(tt->name)".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49771 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
