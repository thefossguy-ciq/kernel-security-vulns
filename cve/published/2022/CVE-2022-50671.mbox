Subject: CVE-2022-50671: RDMA/rxe: Fix "kernel NULL pointer dereference" error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix "kernel NULL pointer dereference" error

When rxe_queue_init in the function rxe_qp_init_req fails,
both qp->req.task.func and qp->req.task.arg are not initialized.

Because of creation of qp fails, the function rxe_create_qp will
call rxe_qp_do_cleanup to handle allocated resource.

Before calling __rxe_do_task, both qp->req.task.func and
qp->req.task.arg should be checked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
