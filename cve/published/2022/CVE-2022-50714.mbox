Subject: CVE-2022-50714: wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix rmmod crash in driver reload test

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix rmmod crash in driver reload test

In insmod/rmmod stress test, the following crash dump shows up immediately.
The problem is caused by missing mt76_dev in mt7921_pci_remove(). We
should make sure the drvdata is ready before probe() finished.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
