Subject: CVE-2022-49848: phy: qcom-qmp-combo: fix NULL-deref on runtime resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: qcom-qmp-combo: fix NULL-deref on runtime resume

Commit fc64623637da ("phy: qcom-qmp-combo,usb: add support for separate
PCS_USB region") started treating the PCS_USB registers as potentially
separate from the PCS registers but used the wrong base when no PCS_USB
offset has been provided.

Fix the PCS_USB base used at runtime resume to prevent dereferencing a
NULL pointer on platforms that do not provide a PCS_USB offset (e.g.
SC7180).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
