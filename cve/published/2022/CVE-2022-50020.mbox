Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid resizing to a partial cluster size

This patch avoids an attempt to resize the filesystem to an
unaligned cluster boundary.  An online resize to a size that is not
integral to cluster size results in the last iteration attempting to
grow the fs by a negative amount, which trips a BUG_ON and leaves the fs
with a corrupted in-memory superblock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
