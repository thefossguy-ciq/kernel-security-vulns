Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: qcom-adm: fix wrong sizeof config in slave_config

Fix broken slave_config function that uncorrectly compare the
peripheral_size with the size of the config pointer instead of the size
of the config struct. This cause the crci value to be ignored and cause
a kernel panic on any slave that use adm driver.

To fix this, compare to the size of the struct and NOT the size of the
pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50540 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
