Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/omap: dss: Fix refcount leak bugs

In dss_init_ports() and __dss_uninit_ports(), we should call
of_node_put() for the reference returned by of_graph_get_port_by_id()
in fail path or when it is not used anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50574 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
