Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: mt8173: Enable IRQ when pdata is ready

If the device does not come straight from reset, we might receive an IRQ
before we are ready to handle it.


[    2.334737] Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 00000000000001e4
[    2.522601] Call trace:

...
[    2.598921]  start_kernel+0x338/0x42c

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50439 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
