Subject: CVE-2022-50217: fuse: write inode in fuse_release()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: write inode in fuse_release()

A race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after
fuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from
fuse_release(), then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any
remaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.

This is a partial revert of the blamed commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50217 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
