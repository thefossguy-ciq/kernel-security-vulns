Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: Fix pcluster memleak when its block address is zero

syzkaller reported a memleak:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=62f37ff612f0021641eda5b17f056f1668aa9aed

unreferenced object 0xffff88811009c7f8 (size 136):
  ...
  backtrace:
    [<ffffffff821db19b>] z_erofs_do_read_page+0x99b/0x1740
    [<ffffffff821dee9e>] z_erofs_readahead+0x24e/0x580
    [<ffffffff814bc0d6>] read_pages+0x86/0x3d0
    ...

syzkaller constructed a case: in z_erofs_register_pcluster(),
ztailpacking = false and map->m_pa = zero. This makes pcl->obj.index be
zero although pcl is not a inline pcluster.

Then following path adds refcount for grp, but the refcount won't be put
because pcl is inline.

z_erofs_readahead()
  z_erofs_do_read_page() # for another page
    z_erofs_collector_begin()
      erofs_find_workgroup()
        erofs_workgroup_get()

Since it's illegal for the block address of a non-inlined pcluster to
be zero, add check here to avoid registering the pcluster which would
be leaked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50743 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac54c1f7b288d83b6ba1e320efff24ecc21309cd
