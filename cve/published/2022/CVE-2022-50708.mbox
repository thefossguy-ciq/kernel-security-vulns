Subject: CVE-2022-50708: HSI: ssi_protocol: fix potential resource leak in ssip_pn_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HSI: ssi_protocol: fix potential resource leak in ssip_pn_open()

ssip_pn_open() claims the HSI client's port with hsi_claim_port(). When
hsi_register_port_event() gets some error and returns a negetive value,
the HSI client's port should be released with hsi_release_port().

Fix it by calling hsi_release_port() when hsi_register_port_event() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
