Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix null-ptr-deref while calling getpeername()

Fix a NULL pointer crash that occurs when we are freeing the socket at the
same time we access it via sysfs.

The problem is that:

 1. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() take
    the frwd_lock and do sock_hold() then drop the frwd_lock. sock_hold()
    does a get on the "struct sock".

 2. iscsi_sw_tcp_release_conn() does sockfd_put() which does the last put
    on the "struct socket" and that does __sock_release() which sets the
    sock->ops to NULL.

 3. iscsi_sw_tcp_conn_get_param() and iscsi_sw_tcp_host_get_param() then
    call kernel_getpeername() which accesses the NULL sock->ops.

Above we do a get on the "struct sock", but we needed a get on the "struct
socket". Originally, we just held the frwd_lock the entire time but in
commit bcf3a2953d36 ("scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Avoid holding spinlock while
calling getpeername()") we switched to refcount based because the network
layer changed and started taking a mutex in that path, so we could no
longer hold the frwd_lock.

Instead of trying to maintain multiple refcounts, this just has us use a
mutex for accessing the socket in the interface code paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50459 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/884a788f065578bb640382279a83d1df433b13e6
