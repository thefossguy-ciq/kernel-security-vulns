Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix memory leak in hpd_rx_irq_create_workqueue()

If construction of the array of work queues to handle hpd_rx_irq offload
work fails, we need to unwind. Destroy all the created workqueues and
the allocated memory for the hpd_rx_irq_offload_work_queue struct array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50515 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
