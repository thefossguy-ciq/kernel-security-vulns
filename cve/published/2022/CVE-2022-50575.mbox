Subject: CVE-2022-50575: xen/privcmd: Fix a possible warning in privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/privcmd: Fix a possible warning in privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource()

As 'kdata.num' is user-controlled data, if user tries to allocate
memory larger than(>=) MAX_ORDER, then kcalloc() will fail, it
creates a stack trace and messes up dmesg with a warning.

Call trace:
-> privcmd_ioctl
--> privcmd_ioctl_mmap_resource

Add __GFP_NOWARN in order to avoid too large allocation warning.
This is detected by static analysis using smatch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50575 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
