Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: microchip: Fix refcount leak in mc_pcie_init_irq_domains()

of_get_next_child() returns a node pointer with refcount incremented, so we
should use of_node_put() on it when we don't need it anymore.

mc_pcie_init_irq_domains() only calls of_node_put() in the normal path,
missing it in some error paths.  Add missing of_node_put() to avoid
refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50157 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
