Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix page fault in snd_hda_codec_shutdown()

If early probe of HDAudio bus driver fails e.g.: due to missing
firmware file, snd_hda_codec_shutdown() ends in manipulating
uninitialized codec->pcm_list_head causing page fault.

Iinitialization of HDAudio codec in ASoC is split in two:
- snd_hda_codec_device_init()
- snd_hda_codec_device_new()

snd_hda_codec_device_init() is called during probe_codecs() by HDAudio
bus driver while snd_hda_codec_device_new() is called by
codec-component's ->probe(). The second call will not happen until all
components required by related sound card are present within the ASoC
framework. With firmware failing to load during the PCI's deferred
initialization i.e.: probe_work(), no platform components are ever
registered. HDAudio codec enumeration is done at that point though, so
the codec components became registered to ASoC framework, calling
snd_hda_codec_device_init() in the process.

Now, during platform reboot snd_hda_codec_shutdown() is called for every
codec found on the HDAudio bus causing oops if any of them has not
completed both of their initialization steps. Relocating field
initialization fixes the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50018 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.19.4 with commit e02db5c2c2ee15bc9a9ec8a86a614fd091e584dc

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-50018
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/pci/hda/hda_codec.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e02db5c2c2ee15bc9a9ec8a86a614fd091e584dc
