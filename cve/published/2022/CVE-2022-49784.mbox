Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/amd/uncore: Fix memory leak for events array

When a CPU comes online, the per-CPU NB and LLC uncore contexts are
freed but not the events array within the context structure. This
causes a memory leak as identified by the kmemleak detector.

Fix the problem by freeing the events array before freeing the uncore
context.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f75be9885d49e3717de962345c4572ddab52b178
