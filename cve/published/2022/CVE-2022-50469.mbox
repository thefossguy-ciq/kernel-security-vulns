Subject: CVE-2022-50469: staging: rtl8723bs: fix potential memory leak in rtw_init_drv_sw()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix potential memory leak in rtw_init_drv_sw()

In rtw_init_drv_sw(), there are various init functions are called to
populate the padapter structure and some checks for their return value.
However, except for the first one error path, the other five error paths
do not properly release the previous allocated resources, which leads to
various memory leaks.

This patch fixes them and keeps the success and error separate.
Note that these changes keep the form of `rtw_init_drv_sw()` in
"drivers/staging/r8188eu/os_dep/os_intfs.c". As there is no proper device
to test with, no runtime testing was performed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50469 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
