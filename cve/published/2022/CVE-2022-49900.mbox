Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: piix4: Fix adapter not be removed in piix4_remove()

In piix4_probe(), the piix4 adapter will be registered in:

   piix4_probe()
     piix4_add_adapters_sb800() / piix4_add_adapter()
       i2c_add_adapter()

Based on the probed device type, piix4_add_adapters_sb800() or single
piix4_add_adapter() will be called.
For the former case, piix4_adapter_count is set as the number of adapters,
while for antoher case it is not set and kept default *zero*.

When piix4 is removed, piix4_remove() removes the adapters added in
piix4_probe(), basing on the piix4_adapter_count value.
Because the count is zero for the single adapter case, the adapter won't
be removed and makes the sources allocated for adapter leaked, such as
the i2c client and device.

These sources can still be accessed by i2c or bus and cause problems.
An easily reproduced case is that if a new adapter is registered, i2c
will get the leaked adapter and try to call smbus_algorithm, which was
already freed:

Fix this problem by correctly set piix4_adapter_count as 1 for the
single adapter so it can be normally removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49900 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
