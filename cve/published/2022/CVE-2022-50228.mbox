Subject: CVE-2022-50228: KVM: SVM: Don't BUG if userspace injects an interrupt with GIF=0

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Don't BUG if userspace injects an interrupt with GIF=0

Don't BUG/WARN on interrupt injection due to GIF being cleared,
since it's trivial for userspace to force the situation via
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS (even if having at least a WARN there would be correct
for KVM internally generated injections).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
