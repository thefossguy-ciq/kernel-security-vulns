Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: tw686x: Fix memory leak in tw686x_video_init

video_device_alloc() allocates memory for vdev,
when video_register_device() fails, it doesn't release the memory and
leads to memory leak, call video_device_release() to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
