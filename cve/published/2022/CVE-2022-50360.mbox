Subject: CVE-2022-50360: drm/msm/dp: fix aux-bus EP lifetime

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: fix aux-bus EP lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP aux-bus, an attempt to populate the bus a second time will
simply fail ("DP AUX EP device already populated").

Fix this by tying the lifetime of the EP device to the DRM device rather
than DP controller platform device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50360 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8768663188e4169333f66583e4d2432e65c421df
