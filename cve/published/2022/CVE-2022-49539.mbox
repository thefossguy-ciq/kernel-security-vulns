Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtw89: ser: fix CAM leaks occurring in L2 reset

The CAM, meaning address CAM and bssid CAM here, will get leaks during
SER (system error recover) L2 reset process and ieee80211_restart_hw()
which is called by L2 reset process eventually.

The normal flow would be like
-> add interface (acquire 1)
-> enter ips (release 1)
-> leave ips (acquire 1)
-> connection (occupy 1) <(A) 1 leak after L2 reset if non-sec connection>

The ieee80211_restart_hw() flow (under connection)
-> ieee80211 reconfig
-> add interface (acquire 1)
-> leave ips (acquire 1)
-> connection (occupy (A) + 2) <(B) 1 more leak>

Originally, CAM is released before HW restart only if connection is under
security. Now, release CAM whatever connection it is to fix leak in (A).
OTOH, check if CAM is already valid to avoid acquiring multiple times to
fix (B).

Besides, if AP mode, release address CAM of all stations before HW restart.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49539 to this issue.

Affected files

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw89/cam.c
	drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw89/ser.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6aff772c9978844529618d86aafb53e5d3ae161
