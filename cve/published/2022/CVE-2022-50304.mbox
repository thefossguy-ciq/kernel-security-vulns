Subject: CVE-2022-50304: mtd: core: fix possible resource leak in init_mtd()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: core: fix possible resource leak in init_mtd()

I got the error report while inject fault in init_mtd():

sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/virtual/bdi/mtd-0'
Call Trace:

kobject_add_internal failed for mtd-0 with -EEXIST, don't try to register
	things with the same name in the same directory.
Error registering mtd class or bdi: -17

If init_mtdchar() fails in init_mtd(), mtd_bdi will not be unregistered,
as a result, we can't load the mtd module again, to fix this by calling
bdi_unregister(mtd_bdi) after out_procfs label.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50304 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
