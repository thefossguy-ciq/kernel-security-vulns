Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/privcmd: fix error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op()

The error exit of privcmd_ioctl_dm_op() is calling unlock_pages()
potentially with pages being NULL, leading to a NULL dereference.

Additionally lock_pages() doesn't check for pin_user_pages_fast()
having been completely successful, resulting in potentially not
locking all pages into memory. This could result in sporadic failures
when using the related memory in user mode.

Fix all of that by calling unlock_pages() always with the real number
of pinned pages, which will be zero in case pages being NULL, and by
checking the number of pages pinned by pin_user_pages_fast() matching
the expected number of pages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49989 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
