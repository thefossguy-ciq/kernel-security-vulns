Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpci: fix of node refcount leak in tcpci_register_port()

I got the following report while doing device(mt6370-tcpc) load
test with CONFIG_OF_UNITTEST and CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC enabled:

  OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,
  of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry:
  attach overlay node /i2c/pmic@34/tcpc/connector

The 'fwnode' set in tcpci_parse_config() which is called
in tcpci_register_port(), its node refcount is increased
in device_get_named_child_node(). It needs be put while
exiting, so call fwnode_handle_put() in the error path of
tcpci_register_port() and in tcpci_unregister_port() to
avoid leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50246 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
