Subject: CVE-2022-50766: btrfs: set generation before calling btrfs_clean_tree_block in btrfs_init_new_buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: set generation before calling btrfs_clean_tree_block in btrfs_init_new_buffer

syzbot is reporting uninit-value in btrfs_clean_tree_block() [1], for
commit bc877d285ca3dba2 ("btrfs: Deduplicate extent_buffer init code")
missed that btrfs_set_header_generation() in btrfs_init_new_buffer() must
not be moved to after clean_tree_block() because clean_tree_block() is
calling btrfs_header_generation() since commit 55c69072d6bd5be1 ("Btrfs:
Fix extent_buffer usage when nodesize != leafsize").

Since memzero_extent_buffer() will reset "struct btrfs_header" part, we
can't move btrfs_set_header_generation() to before memzero_extent_buffer().
Just re-add btrfs_set_header_generation() before btrfs_clean_tree_block().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50766 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
