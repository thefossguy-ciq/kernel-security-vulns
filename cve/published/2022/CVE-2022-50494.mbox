Subject: CVE-2022-50494: thermal: intel_powerclamp: Use get_cpu() instead of smp_processor_id() to avoid crash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: intel_powerclamp: Use get_cpu() instead of smp_processor_id() to avoid crash

When CPU 0 is offline and intel_powerclamp is used to inject
idle, it generates kernel BUG:

BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: bash/15687
caller is debug_smp_processor_id+0x17/0x20
CPU: 4 PID: 15687 Comm: bash Not tainted 5.19.0-rc7+ #57
Call Trace:
<TASK>
dump_stack_lvl+0x49/0x63
dump_stack+0x10/0x16
check_preemption_disabled+0xdd/0xe0
debug_smp_processor_id+0x17/0x20
powerclamp_set_cur_state+0x7f/0xf9 [intel_powerclamp]
...
...

Here CPU 0 is the control CPU by default and changed to the current CPU,
if CPU 0 offlined. This check has to be performed under cpus_read_lock(),
hence the above warning.

Use get_cpu() instead of smp_processor_id() to avoid this BUG.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
