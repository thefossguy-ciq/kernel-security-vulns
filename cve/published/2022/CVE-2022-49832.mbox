Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: devicetree: fix null pointer dereferencing in pinctrl_dt_to_map

Here is the BUG report by KASAN about null pointer dereference:

BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in strcmp+0x2e/0x50
Read of size 1 at addr 0000000000000000 by task python3/2640
Call Trace:
 strcmp
 __of_find_property
 of_find_property
 pinctrl_dt_to_map

kasprintf() would return NULL pointer when kmalloc() fail to allocate.
So directly return ENOMEM, if kasprintf() return NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49832 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
