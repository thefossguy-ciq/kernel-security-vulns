Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in rxe_qp_do_cleanup

The function rxe_create_qp calls rxe_qp_from_init. If some error
occurs, the error handler of function rxe_qp_from_init will set
both scq and rcq to NULL.

Then rxe_create_qp calls rxe_put to handle qp. In the end,
rxe_qp_do_cleanup is called by rxe_put. rxe_qp_do_cleanup directly
accesses scq and rcq before checking them. This will cause
null-ptr-deref error.

The call graph is as below:

rxe_create_qp {
  ...
  rxe_qp_from_init {
    ...
  err1:
    ...
    qp->rcq = NULL;  <---rcq is set to NULL
    qp->scq = NULL;  <---scq is set to NULL
    ...
  }

qp_init:
  rxe_put{
    ...
    rxe_qp_do_cleanup {
      ...
      atomic_dec(&qp->scq->num_wq); <--- scq is accessed
      ...
      atomic_dec(&qp->rcq->num_wq); <--- rcq is accessed
    }
}

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50135 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8598b9d0a364c1663c96fc0fab9df0d36c809aea
