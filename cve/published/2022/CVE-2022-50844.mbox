Subject: CVE-2022-50844: drm/amdgpu: Fix type of second parameter in odn_edit_dpm_table() callback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix type of second parameter in odn_edit_dpm_table() callback

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
reveals:

  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../pm/swsmu/amdgpu_smu.c:3008:29: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'int (*)(void *, uint32_t, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (*)(void *, unsigned int, long *, unsigned int)') with an expression of type 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, uint32_t)' (aka 'int (void *, enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND, long *, unsigned int)') [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
          .odn_edit_dpm_table      = smu_od_edit_dpm_table,
                                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1 error generated.

There are only two implementations of ->odn_edit_dpm_table() in 'struct
amd_pm_funcs': smu_od_edit_dpm_table() and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table(). One
has a second parameter type of 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND' and the
other uses 'u32'. Ultimately, smu_od_edit_dpm_table() calls
->od_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct pptable_funcs' and
pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() calls ->odn_edit_dpm_table() from 'struct
pp_hwmgr_func', which both have a second parameter type of 'enum
PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND'.

Update the type parameter in both the prototype in 'struct amd_pm_funcs'
and pp_odn_edit_dpm_table() to 'enum PP_OD_DPM_TABLE_COMMAND', which
cleans up the warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50844 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
