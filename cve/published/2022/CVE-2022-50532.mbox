Subject: CVE-2022-50532: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix possible resource leaks in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix possible resource leaks in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()

In mpt3sas_transport_port_add(), if sas_rphy_add() returns error,
sas_rphy_free() needs be called to free the resource allocated in
sas_end_device_alloc(). Otherwise a kernel crash will happen:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000108
CPU: 45 PID: 37020 Comm: bash Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.1.0-rc1+ #189

 scsih_remove+0xd8/0x420 [mpt3sas]

Because transport_add_device() is not called when sas_rphy_add() fails, the
device is not added. When sas_rphy_remove() is subsequently called to
remove the device in the remove() path, a NULL pointer dereference happens.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50532 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
