Subject: CVE-2022-50753: f2fs: fix to do sanity check on summary info

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on summary info

As Wenqing Liu reported in bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216456

BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in recover_data+0x63ae/0x6ae0 [f2fs]
Read of size 4 at addr ffff8881464dcd80 by task mount/1013

CPU: 3 PID: 1013 Comm: mount Tainted: G        W          6.0.0-rc4 #1
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014

The root cause is: in fuzzed image, SSA table is corrupted: ofs_in_node
is larger than ADDRS_PER_PAGE(), result in out-of-range access on 4k-size
page.

- recover_data
 - do_recover_data
  - check_index_in_prev_nodes
   - f2fs_data_blkaddr

This patch adds sanity check on summary info in recovery and GC flow
in where the flows rely on them.

After patch:
[   29.310883] F2FS-fs (loop0): Inconsistent ofs_in_node:65286 in summary, ino:0, nid:6, max:1018

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50753 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
