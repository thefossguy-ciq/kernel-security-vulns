Subject: CVE-2022-49776: macvlan: enforce a consistent minimal mtu

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

macvlan: enforce a consistent minimal mtu

macvlan should enforce a minimal mtu of 68, even at link creation.

This patch avoids the current behavior (which could lead to crashes
in ipv6 stack if the link is brought up)

$ ip link add macvlan1 link eno1 mtu 8 type macvlan  # This should fail !
$ ip link sh dev macvlan1
5: macvlan1@eno1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 8 qdisc noop
    state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:47:6c:24:74:82 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
$ ip link set macvlan1 mtu 67
Error: mtu less than device minimum.
$ ip link set macvlan1 mtu 68
$ ip link set macvlan1 mtu 8
Error: mtu less than device minimum.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49776 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
