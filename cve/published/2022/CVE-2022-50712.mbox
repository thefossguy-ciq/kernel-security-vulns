Subject: CVE-2022-50712: devlink: hold region lock when flushing snapshots

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devlink: hold region lock when flushing snapshots

Netdevsim triggers a splat on reload, when it destroys regions
with snapshots pending:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 787 at net/core/devlink.c:6291 devlink_region_snapshot_del+0x12e/0x140
  CPU: 1 PID: 787 Comm: devlink Not tainted 6.1.0-07460-g7ae9888d6e1c #580
  RIP: 0010:devlink_region_snapshot_del+0x12e/0x140
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>
   devl_region_destroy+0x70/0x140
   nsim_dev_reload_down+0x2f/0x60 [netdevsim]

   devlink_nl_cmd_reload+0x6ce/0x860
   genl_family_rcv_msg_doit.isra.0+0x145/0x1c0

This is the locking assert in devlink_region_snapshot_del(),
we're supposed to be holding the region->snapshot_lock here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50712 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
