Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix wrong offset in bio_truncate()

bio_truncate() clears the buffer outside of last block of bdev, however
current bio_truncate() is using the wrong offset of page. So it can
return the uninitialized data.

This happened when both of truncated/corrupted FS and userspace (via
bdev) are trying to read the last of bdev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48747 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.4.176 with commit 6cbf4c731d78
	Fixed in 5.10.96 with commit b63e120189fd

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
