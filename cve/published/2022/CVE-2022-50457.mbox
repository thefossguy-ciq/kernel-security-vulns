Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: core: Fix refcount error in del_mtd_device()

del_mtd_device() will call of_node_put() to mtd_get_of_node(mtd), which
is mtd->dev.of_node. However, memset(&mtd->dev, 0) is called before
of_node_put(). As the result, of_node_put() won't do anything in
del_mtd_device(), and causes the refcount leak.

del_mtd_device()
    memset(&mtd->dev, 0, sizeof(mtd->dev) # clear mtd->dev
    of_node_put()
        mtd_get_of_node(mtd) # mtd->dev is cleared, can't locate of_node
                             # of_node_put(NULL) won't do anything

Fix the error by caching the pointer of the device_node.

OF: ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2,
of_node_get()/of_node_put() unbalanced - destroy cset entry: attach

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
