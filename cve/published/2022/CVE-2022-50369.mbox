Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vkms: Fix null-ptr-deref in vkms_release()

A null-ptr-deref is triggered when it tries to destroy the workqueue in
vkms->output.composer_workq in vkms_release().

 KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000118-0x000000000000011f]
 CPU: 5 PID: 17193 Comm: modprobe Not tainted 6.0.0-11331-gd465bff130bf #24
 RIP: 0010:destroy_workqueue+0x2f/0x710
 ...
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  ? vkms_config_debugfs_init+0x50/0x50 [vkms]
  __devm_drm_dev_alloc+0x15a/0x1c0 [drm]
  vkms_init+0x245/0x1000 [vkms]

  do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80
  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

The reason is that an OOM happened which triggers the destroy of the
workqueue, however, the workqueue is alloced in the later process,
thus a null-ptr-deref happened. A simple call graph is shown as below:

 vkms_init()
  vkms_create()
    devm_drm_dev_alloc()
      __devm_drm_dev_alloc()
        devm_drm_dev_init()
          devm_add_action_or_reset()
            devm_add_action() # an error happened
            devm_drm_dev_init_release()
              drm_dev_put()
                kref_put()
                  drm_dev_release()
                    vkms_release()
                      destroy_workqueue() # null-ptr-deref happened
    vkms_modeset_init()
      vkms_output_init()
        vkms_crtc_init() # where the workqueue get allocated

Fix this by checking if composer_workq is NULL before passing it to
the destroy_workqueue() in vkms_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50369 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
