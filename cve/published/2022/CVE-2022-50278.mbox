Subject: CVE-2022-50278: PNP: fix name memory leak in pnp_alloc_dev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PNP: fix name memory leak in pnp_alloc_dev()

After commit 1fa5ae857bb1 ("driver core: get rid of struct device's
bus_id string array"), the name of device is allocated dynamically,
move dev_set_name() after pnp_add_id() to avoid memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50278 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
