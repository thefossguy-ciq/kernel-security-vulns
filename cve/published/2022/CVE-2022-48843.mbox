Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vrr: Set VRR capable prop only if it is attached to connector

VRR capable property is not attached by default to the connector
It is attached only if VRR is supported.
So if the driver tries to call drm core set prop function without
it being attached that causes NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48843 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
