Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: imx-sdma: Fix a possible memory leak in sdma_transfer_init

If the function sdma_load_context() fails, the sdma_desc will be
freed, but the allocated desc->bd is forgot to be freed.

We already met the sdma_load_context() failure case and the log as
below:
[ 450.699064] imx-sdma 30bd0000.dma-controller: Timeout waiting for CH0 ready
...

In this case, the desc->bd will not be freed without this change.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49746 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
