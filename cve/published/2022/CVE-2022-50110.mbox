Subject: CVE-2022-50110: watchdog: sp5100_tco: Fix a memory leak of EFCH MMIO resource

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

watchdog: sp5100_tco: Fix a memory leak of EFCH MMIO resource

Unlike release_mem_region(), a call to release_resource() does not
free the resource, so it has to be freed explicitly to avoid a memory
leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
