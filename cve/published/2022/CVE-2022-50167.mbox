Subject: CVE-2022-50167: bpf: fix potential 32-bit overflow when accessing ARRAY map element

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix potential 32-bit overflow when accessing ARRAY map element

If BPF array map is bigger than 4GB, element pointer calculation can
overflow because both index and elem_size are u32. Fix this everywhere
by forcing 64-bit multiplication. Extract this formula into separate
small helper and use it consistently in various places.

Speculative-preventing formula utilizing index_mask trick is left as is,
but explicit u64 casts are added in both places.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50167 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
