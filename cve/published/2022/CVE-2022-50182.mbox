Subject: CVE-2022-50182: media: imx-jpeg: Align upwards buffer size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Align upwards buffer size

The hardware can support any image size WxH,
with arbitrary W (image width) and H (image height) dimensions.

Align upwards buffer size for both encoder and decoder.
and leave the picture resolution unchanged.

For decoder, the risk of memory out of bounds can be avoided.
For both encoder and decoder, the driver will lift the limitation of
resolution alignment.

For example, the decoder can support jpeg whose resolution is 227x149
the encoder can support nv12 1080P, won't change it to 1920x1072.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50182 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
