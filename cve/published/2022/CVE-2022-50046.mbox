Subject: CVE-2022-50046: net/sunrpc: fix potential memory leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sunrpc: fix potential memory leaks in rpc_sysfs_xprt_state_change()

The issue happens on some error handling paths. When the function
fails to grab the object `xprt`, it simply returns 0, forgetting to
decrease the reference count of another object `xps`, which is
increased by rpc_sysfs_xprt_kobj_get_xprt_switch(), causing refcount
leaks. Also, the function forgets to check whether `xps` is valid
before using it, which may result in NULL-dereferencing issues.

Fix it by adding proper error handling code when either `xprt` or
`xps` is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50046 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
