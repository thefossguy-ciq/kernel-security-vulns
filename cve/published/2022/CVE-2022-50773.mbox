Subject: CVE-2022-50773: ALSA: mts64: fix possible null-ptr-defer in snd_mts64_interrupt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: mts64: fix possible null-ptr-defer in snd_mts64_interrupt

I got a null-ptr-defer error report when I do the following tests
on the qemu platform:

make defconfig and CONFIG_PARPORT=m, CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m,
CONFIG_SND_MTS64=m

Then making test scripts:
cat>test_mod1.sh<<EOF
modprobe snd-mts64
modprobe snd-mts64
EOF

Executing the script, perhaps several times, we will get a null-ptr-defer
report, as follow:

syzkaller:~# ./test_mod.sh
snd_mts64: probe of snd_mts64.0 failed with error -5
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'snd_mts64': No such device
 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
