Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: hpsa: Fix possible memory leak in hpsa_init_one()

The hpda_alloc_ctlr_info() allocates h and its field reply_map. However, in
hpsa_init_one(), if alloc_percpu() failed, the hpsa_init_one() jumps to
clean1 directly, which frees h and leaks the h->reply_map.

Fix by calling hpda_free_ctlr_info() to release h->replay_map and h instead
free h directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50646 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
