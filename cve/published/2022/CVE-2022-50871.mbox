Subject: CVE-2022-50871: wifi: ath11k: Fix qmi_msg_handler data structure initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Fix qmi_msg_handler data structure initialization

qmi_msg_handler is required to be null terminated by QMI module.
There might be a case where a handler for a msg id is not present in the
handlers array which can lead to infinite loop while searching the handler
and therefore out of bound access in qmi_invoke_handler().
Hence update the initialization in qmi_msg_handler data structure.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-01100-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
