Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Protect memory leak for NPIV ports sending PLOGI_RJT

There is a potential memory leak in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl() and
lpfc_els_rsp_reject() that was allocated from NPIV PLOGI_RJT
(lpfc_rcv_plogi()'s login_mbox).

Check if cmdiocb->context_un.mbox was allocated in lpfc_ignore_els_cmpl(),
and then free it back to phba->mbox_mem_pool along with mbox->ctx_buf for
service parameters.

For lpfc_els_rsp_reject() failure, free both the ctx_buf for service
parameters and the login_mbox.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49534 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.18.3 with commit c00df0f34a6d5e14da379f96ea67e501ce67b002

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-49534
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_nportdisc.c
	drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c00df0f34a6d5e14da379f96ea67e501ce67b002
