Subject: CVE-2022-49802: ftrace: Fix null pointer dereference in ftrace_add_mod()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix null pointer dereference in ftrace_add_mod()

The @ftrace_mod is allocated by kzalloc(), so both the members {prev,next}
of @ftrace_mode->list are NULL, it's not a valid state to call list_del().
If kstrdup() for @ftrace_mod->{func|module} fails, it goes to @out_free
tag and calls free_ftrace_mod() to destroy @ftrace_mod, then list_del()
will write prev->next and next->prev, where null pointer dereference
happens.

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI

So call INIT_LIST_HEAD() to initialize the list member to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49802 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
