Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rpmsg: char: Avoid double destroy of default endpoint

The rpmsg_dev_remove() in rpmsg_core is the place for releasing
this default endpoint.

So need to avoid destroying the default endpoint in
rpmsg_chrdev_eptdev_destroy(), this should be the same as
rpmsg_eptdev_release(). Otherwise there will be double destroy
issue that ept->refcount report warning:

refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

Call trace:
 refcount_warn_saturate+0xf8/0x150
 virtio_rpmsg_destroy_ept+0xd4/0xec
 rpmsg_dev_remove+0x60/0x70

The issue can be reproduced by stopping remoteproc before
closing the /dev/rpmsgX.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50421 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
