Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: prevent leak of lsm program after failed attach

In [0], we added the ability to bpf_prog_attach LSM programs to cgroups,
but in our validation to make sure the prog is meant to be attached to
BPF_LSM_CGROUP, we return too early if the check fails. This results in
lack of decrementing prog's refcnt (through bpf_prog_put)
leaving the LSM program alive past the point of the expected lifecycle.
This fix allows for the decrement to take place.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
