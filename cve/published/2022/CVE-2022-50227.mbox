Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/xen: Initialize Xen timer only once

Add a check for existing xen timers before initializing a new one.

Currently kvm_xen_init_timer() is called on every
KVM_XEN_VCPU_ATTR_TYPE_TIMER, which is causing the following ODEBUG
crash when vcpu->arch.xen.timer is already set.

ODEBUG: init active (active state 0)
object type: hrtimer hint: xen_timer_callbac0
RIP: 0010:debug_print_object+0x16e/0x250 lib/debugobjects.c:502
Call Trace:
__debug_object_init
debug_hrtimer_init
debug_init
hrtimer_init
kvm_xen_init_timer
kvm_xen_vcpu_set_attr
kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl
kvm_vcpu_ioctl
vfs_ioctl

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50227 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/x86/kvm/xen.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a9b5771e930f408c3419799000f76a9abaf2278
