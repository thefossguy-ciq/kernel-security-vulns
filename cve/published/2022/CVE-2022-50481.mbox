Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl: fix possible null-ptr-deref in cxl_guest_init_afu|adapter()

If device_register() fails in cxl_register_afu|adapter(), the device
is not added, device_unregister() can not be called in the error path,
otherwise it will cause a null-ptr-deref because of removing not added
device.

As comment of device_register() says, it should use put_device() to give
up the reference in the error path. So split device_unregister() into
device_del() and put_device(), then goes to put dev when register fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50481 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
