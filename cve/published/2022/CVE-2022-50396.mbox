====================================

Kernel uses tcindex_change() to change an existing
filter properties.

Yet the problem is that, during the process of changing,
if `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect`, then
kernel uses tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash() to newly
allocate filter results, uses tcindex_filter_result_init()
to clear the old filter result, without destroying
its tcf_exts structure, which triggers the above memory leak.

To be more specific, there are only two source for the `old_r`,
according to the tcindex_lookup(). `old_r` is retrieved from
`p->perfect`, or `old_r` is retrieved from `p->h`.

  * If `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect`, kernel uses
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash() to newly allocate the
filter results. Then `r` is assigned with `cp->perfect + handle`,
which is newly allocated. So condition `old_r && old_r != r` is
true in this situation, and kernel uses tcindex_filter_result_init()
to clear the old filter result, without destroying
its tcf_exts structure

  * If `old_r` is retrieved from `p->h`, then `p->perfect` is NULL
according to the tcindex_lookup(). Considering that `cp->h`
is directly copied from `p->h` and `p->perfect` is NULL,
`r` is assigned with `tcindex_lookup(cp, handle)`, whose value
should be the same as `old_r`, so condition `old_r && old_r != r`
is false in this situation, kernel ignores using
tcindex_filter_result_init() to clear the old filter result.

So only when `old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect` does kernel use
tcindex_filter_result_init() to clear the old filter result, which
triggers the above memory leak.

Considering that there already exists a tc_filter_wq workqueue
to destroy the old tcindex_data by tcindex_partial_destroy_work()
at the end of tcindex_set_parms(), this patch solves
this memory leak bug by removing this old filter result
clearing part and delegating it to the tc_filter_wq workqueue.

Note that this patch doesn't introduce any other issues. If
`old_r` is retrieved from `p->perfect`, this patch just
delegates old filter result clearing part to the
tc_filter_wq workqueue; If `old_r` is retrieved from `p->h`,
kernel doesn't reach the old filter result clearing part, so
removing this part has no effect.

and Dmitry Vyukov]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50396 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
