Subject: CVE-2022-49762: ntfs: check overflow when iterating ATTR_RECORDs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: check overflow when iterating ATTR_RECORDs

Kernel iterates over ATTR_RECORDs in mft record in ntfs_attr_find(). 
Because the ATTR_RECORDs are next to each other, kernel can get the next
ATTR_RECORD from end address of current ATTR_RECORD, through current
ATTR_RECORD length field.

The problem is that during iteration, when kernel calculates the end
address of current ATTR_RECORD, kernel may trigger an integer overflow bug
in executing `a = (ATTR_RECORD*)((u8*)a + le32_to_cpu(a->length))`.  This
may wrap, leading to a forever iteration on 32bit systems.

This patch solves it by adding some checks on calculating end address
of current ATTR_RECORD during iteration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49762 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
