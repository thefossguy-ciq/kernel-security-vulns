Subject: CVE-2022-49975: bpf: Don't redirect packets with invalid pkt_len

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Don't redirect packets with invalid pkt_len

Syzbot found an issue [1]: fq_codel_drop() try to drop a flow whitout any
skbs, that is, the flow->head is null.
The root cause, as the [2] says, is because that bpf_prog_test_run_skb()
run a bpf prog which redirects empty skbs.
So we should determine whether the length of the packet modified by bpf
prog or others like bpf_prog_test is valid before forwarding it directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49975 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
