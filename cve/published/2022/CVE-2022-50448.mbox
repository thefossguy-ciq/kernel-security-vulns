Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/uffd: fix warning without PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP compiled in

When PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP not configured, it's still possible to reach pte
marker code and trigger an warning. Add a few CONFIG_PTE_MARKER_UFFD_WP
ifdefs to make sure the code won't be reached when not compiled in.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50448 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
