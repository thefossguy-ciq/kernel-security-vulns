Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

apparmor: Fix memleak in aa_simple_write_to_buffer()

When copy_from_user failed, the memory is freed by kvfree. however the
management struct and data blob are allocated independently, so only
kvfree(data) cause a memleak issue here. Use aa_put_loaddata(data) to
fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50074 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
