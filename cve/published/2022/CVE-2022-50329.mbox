Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix uaf for bfqq in bfq_exit_icq_bfqq

Commit 64dc8c732f5c ("block, bfq: fix possible uaf for 'bfqq->bic'")
will access 'bic->bfqq' in bic_set_bfqq(), however, bfq_exit_icq_bfqq()
can free bfqq first, and then call bic_set_bfqq(), which will cause uaf.

Fix the problem by moving bfq_exit_bfqq() behind bic_set_bfqq().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50329 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
