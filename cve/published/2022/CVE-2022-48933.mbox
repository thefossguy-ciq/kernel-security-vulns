Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak during stateful obj update

stateful objects can be updated from the control plane.
The transaction logic allocates a temporary object for this purpose.

The ->init function was called for this object, so plain kfree() leaks
resources. We must call ->destroy function of the object.

nft_obj_destroy does this, but it also decrements the module refcount,
but the update path doesn't increment it.

To avoid special-casing the update object release, do module_get for
the update case too and release it via nft_obj_destroy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48933 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
