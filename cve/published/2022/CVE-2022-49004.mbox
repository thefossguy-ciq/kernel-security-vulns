Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Sync efi page table's kernel mappings before switching

The EFI page table is initially created as a copy of the kernel page table.
With VMAP_STACK enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the vmalloc area:
if the stack is allocated in a new PGD (one that was not present at the
moment of the efi page table creation or not synced in a previous vmalloc
fault), the kernel will take a trap when switching to the efi page table
when the vmalloc kernel stack is accessed, resulting in a kernel panic.

Fix that by updating the efi kernel mappings before switching to the efi
page table.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49004 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/riscv/include/asm/efi.h
	arch/riscv/include/asm/pgalloc.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
