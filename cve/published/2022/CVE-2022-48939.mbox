Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Add schedule points in batch ops

syzbot reported various soft lockups caused by bpf batch operations.

 INFO: task kworker/1:1:27 blocked for more than 140 seconds.
 INFO: task hung in rcu_barrier

Nothing prevents batch ops to process huge amount of data,
we need to add schedule points in them.

Note that maybe_wait_bpf_programs(map) calls from
generic_map_delete_batch() can be factorized by moving
the call after the loop.

This will be done later in -next tree once we get this fix merged,
unless there is strong opinion doing this optimization sooner.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48939 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
