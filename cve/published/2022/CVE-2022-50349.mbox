Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: tifm: fix possible memory leak in tifm_7xx1_switch_media()

If device_register() returns error in tifm_7xx1_switch_media(),
name of kobject which is allocated in dev_set_name() called in device_add()
is leaked.

Never directly free @dev after calling device_register(), even
if it returned an error! Always use put_device() to give up the
reference initialized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50349 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
