Subject: CVE-2022-50138: RDMA/qedr: Fix potential memory leak in __qedr_alloc_mr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/qedr: Fix potential memory leak in __qedr_alloc_mr()

__qedr_alloc_mr() allocates a memory chunk for "mr->info.pbl_table" with
init_mr_info(). When rdma_alloc_tid() and rdma_register_tid() fail, "mr"
is released while "mr->info.pbl_table" is not released, which will lead
to a memory leak.

We should release the "mr->info.pbl_table" with qedr_free_pbl() when error
occurs to fix the memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
