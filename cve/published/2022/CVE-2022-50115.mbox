Subject: CVE-2022-50115: ASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology: Prevent double freeing of ipc_control_data via load_bytes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc3-topology: Prevent double freeing of ipc_control_data via load_bytes

We have sanity checks for byte controls and if any of the fail the locally
allocated scontrol->ipc_control_data is freed up, but not set to NULL.

On a rollback path of the error the higher level code will also try to free
the scontrol->ipc_control_data which will eventually going to lead to
memory corruption as double freeing memory is not a good thing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50115 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
