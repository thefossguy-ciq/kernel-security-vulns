Subject: CVE-2022-50301: iommu/omap: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/omap: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs

There are two issues here:

1) The "len" variable needs to be checked before the very first write.
   Otherwise if omap2_iommu_dump_ctx() with "bytes" less than 32 it is a
   buffer overflow.
2) The snprintf() function returns the number of bytes that *would* have
   been copied if there were enough space.  But we want to know the
   number of bytes which were *actually* copied so use scnprintf()
   instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50301 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
