Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seccomp: Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.

Our syzbot instance reported memory leaks in do_seccomp() [0], similar
to the report [1].  It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter
and some objects included in it.

We can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one
seccomp() and two clone() syscalls.

The first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a
signal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the
fatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives
the signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to
user space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()
to decrement the filter's refcount.

Initially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but
the commit 3a15fb6ed92c ("seccomp: release filter after task is fully
dead") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible
that the filter is no longer used.

To keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move
copy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
free_task() for future debugging.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
