Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix running_req for internal abort commands

Disabling the remote phy for a SATA disk causes a hang:

The issue is that the per-device running_req read in
pm8001_dev_gone_notify() never goes to zero and we never make progress.
This is caused by missing accounting for running_req for when an internal
abort command completes.

In commit 2cbbf489778e ("scsi: pm8001: Use libsas internal abort support")
we started to send internal abort commands as a proper sas_task. In this
when we deliver a sas_task to HW the per-device running_req is incremented
in pm8001_queue_command(). However it is never decremented for internal
abort commnds, so decrement in pm8001_mpi_task_abort_resp().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50818 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
