Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix memory leak when build ntlmssp negotiate blob failed

There is a memory leak when mount cifs:
  unreferenced object 0xffff888166059600 (size 448):
    comm "mount.cifs", pid 51391, jiffies 4295596373 (age 330.596s)

When build ntlmssp negotiate blob failed, the session setup request
should be freed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
