Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: fix potential memory leak in octep_device_setup()

When occur unsupported_dev and mbox init errors, it did not free oct->conf
and iounmap() oct->mmio[i].hw_addr. That would trigger memory leak problem.
Add kfree() for oct->conf and iounmap() for oct->mmio[i].hw_addr under
unsupported_dev and mbox init errors to fix the problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
