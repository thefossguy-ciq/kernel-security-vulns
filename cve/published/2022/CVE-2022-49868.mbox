Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: ralink: mt7621-pci: add sentinel to quirks table

With mt7621 soc_dev_attr fixed to register the soc as a device,
kernel will experience an oops in soc_device_match_attr

This quirk test was introduced in the staging driver in
commit 9445ccb3714c ("staging: mt7621-pci-phy: add quirks for 'E2'
revision using 'soc_device_attribute'"). The staging driver was removed,
and later re-added in commit d87da32372a0 ("phy: ralink: Add PHY driver
for MT7621 PCIe PHY") for kernel 5.11

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49868 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
