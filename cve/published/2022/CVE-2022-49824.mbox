Subject: CVE-2022-49824: ata: libata-transport: fix error handling in ata_tlink_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: libata-transport: fix error handling in ata_tlink_add()

In ata_tlink_add(), the return value of transport_add_device() is
not checked. As a result, it causes null-ptr-deref while removing
the module, because transport_remove_device() is called to remove
the device that was not added.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0

Fix this by checking and handling return value of transport_add_device()
in ata_tlink_add().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49824 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
