Subject: CVE-2022-49748: perf/x86/amd: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/amd: fix potential integer overflow on shift of a int

The left shift of int 32 bit integer constant 1 is evaluated using 32 bit
arithmetic and then passed as a 64 bit function argument. In the case where
i is 32 or more this can lead to an overflow.  Avoid this by shifting
using the BIT_ULL macro instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
