Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sfp: fix memory leak in sfp_probe()

sfp_probe() allocates a memory chunk from sfp with sfp_alloc(). When
devm_add_action() fails, sfp is not freed, which leads to a memory leak.

We should use devm_add_action_or_reset() instead of devm_add_action().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49619 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
