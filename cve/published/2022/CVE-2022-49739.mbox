Subject: CVE-2022-49739: gfs2: Always check inode size of inline inodes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Always check inode size of inline inodes

Check if the inode size of stuffed (inline) inodes is within the allowed
range when reading inodes from disk (gfs2_dinode_in()).  This prevents
us from on-disk corruption.

The two checks in stuffed_readpage() and gfs2_unstuffer_page() that just
truncate inline data to the maximum allowed size don't actually make
sense, and they can be removed now as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49739 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
