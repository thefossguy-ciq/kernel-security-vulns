Subject: CVE-2022-50829: wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: Fix use-after-free in ath9k_hif_usb_reg_in_cb()

It is possible that skb is freed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg(), then
usb_submit_urb() fails and we try to free skb again. It causes
use-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb->context becomes
NULL but rx_buf is not freed and there can be a memory leak.

The patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb processing more clear: it
is supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes its
managing to another callback function.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50829 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
