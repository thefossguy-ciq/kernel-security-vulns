Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: uniphier: fix reference count leak in uniphier_spi_probe()

The issue happens in several error paths in uniphier_spi_probe().
When either dma_get_slave_caps() or devm_spi_register_master() returns
an error code, the function forgets to decrease the refcount of both
`dma_rx` and `dma_tx` objects, which may lead to refcount leaks.

Fix it by decrementing the reference count of specific objects in
those error paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48723 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
