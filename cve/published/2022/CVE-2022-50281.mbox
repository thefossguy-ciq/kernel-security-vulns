Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: SGI-IP27: Fix platform-device leak in bridge_platform_create()

In error case in bridge_platform_create after calling
platform_device_add()/platform_device_add_data()/
platform_device_add_resources(), release the failed
'pdev' or it will be leak, call platform_device_put()
to fix this problem.

Besides, 'pdev' is divided into 'pdev_wd' and 'pdev_bd',
use platform_device_unregister() to release sgi_w1
resources when xtalk-bridge registration fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50281 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
