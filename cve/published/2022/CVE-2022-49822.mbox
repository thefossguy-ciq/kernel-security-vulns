Subject: CVE-2022-49822: cifs: Fix connections leak when tlink setup failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix connections leak when tlink setup failed

If the tlink setup failed, lost to put the connections, then
the module refcnt leak since the cifsd kthread not exit.

Also leak the fscache info, and for next mount with fsc, it will
print the follow errors:
  CIFS: Cache volume key already in use (cifs,127.0.0.1:445,TEST)

Let's check the result of tlink setup, and do some cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
