Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap-irq: Use the new num_config_regs property in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode

Commit faa87ce9196d ("regmap-irq: Introduce config registers for irq
types") added the num_config_regs, then commit 9edd4f5aee84 ("regmap-irq:
Deprecate type registers and virtual registers") suggested to replace
num_type_reg with it. However, regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode wasn't modified
to use the new property. Later on, commit 255a03bb1bb3 ("ASoC: wcd9335:
Convert irq chip to config regs") removed the old num_type_reg property
from the WCD9335 driver's struct regmap_irq_chip, causing a null pointer
dereference in regmap_irq_set_type when it tried to index d->type_buf as
it was never allocated in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode:

[   39.199374] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

[   39.200006] Call trace:
[   39.200014]  regmap_irq_set_type+0x84/0x1c0
[   39.200026]  __irq_set_trigger+0x60/0x1c0
[   39.200040]  __setup_irq+0x2f4/0x78c
[   39.200051]  request_threaded_irq+0xe8/0x1a0

Use num_config_regs in regmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode instead of num_type_reg,
and fall back to it if num_config_regs isn't defined to maintain backward
compatibility.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50558 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57bb34330c0fc70bb4ab96399a3c1b80e73e9d49
