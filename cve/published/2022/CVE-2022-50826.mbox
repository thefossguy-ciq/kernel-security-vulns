Subject: CVE-2022-50826: ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in imgu_subdev_set_selection()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in imgu_subdev_set_selection()

Calling v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop() and v4l2_subdev_get_try_compose()
with a subdev state of NULL leads to a NULL pointer dereference. This
can currently happen in imgu_subdev_set_selection() when the state
passed in is NULL, as this method first gets pointers to both the "try"
and "active" states and only then decides which to use.

The same issue has been addressed for imgu_subdev_get_selection() with
commit 30d03a0de650 ("ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active
selection access"). However the issue still persists in
imgu_subdev_set_selection().

Therefore, apply a similar fix as done in the aforementioned commit to
imgu_subdev_set_selection(). To keep things a bit cleaner, introduce
helper functions for "crop" and "compose" access and use them in both
imgu_subdev_set_selection() and imgu_subdev_get_selection().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50826 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
