Subject: CVE-2022-50657: riscv: mm: add missing memcpy in kasan_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: mm: add missing memcpy in kasan_init

Hi Atish,

It seems that the panic is due to the missing memcpy during kasan_init.
Could you please check whether this patch is helpful?

When doing kasan_populate, the new allocated base_pud/base_p4d should
contain kasan_early_shadow_{pud, p4d}'s content. Add the missing memcpy
to avoid page fault when read/write kasan shadow region.

Tested on:
 - qemu with sv57 and CONFIG_KASAN on.
 - qemu with sv48 and CONFIG_KASAN on.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
