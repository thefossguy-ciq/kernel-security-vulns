Subject: CVE-2022-49974: HID: nintendo: fix rumble worker null pointer deref

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: nintendo: fix rumble worker null pointer deref

We can dereference a null pointer trying to queue work to a destroyed
workqueue.

If the device is disconnected, nintendo_hid_remove is called, in which
the rumble_queue is destroyed. Avoid using that queue to defer rumble
work once the controller state is set to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_REMOVED.

This eliminates the null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49974 to this issue.

===========================

	Fixed in 5.19.7 with commit 7c6e6c334154be16740b44dcd7638fb510b9bd91

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
