Subject: CVE-2022-50831: wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free

commit ff05d4b45dd89b922578dac497dcabf57cf771c6

When we parse a multi-BSSID element, we might point some
element pointers into the allocated nontransmitted_profile.
However, we free this before returning, causing UAF when the
relevant pointers in the parsed elements are accessed.

Fix this by not allocating the scratch buffer separately but
as part of the returned structure instead, that way, there
are no lifetime issues with it.

The scratch buffer introduction as part of the returned data
here is taken from MLO feature work done by Ilan.

This fixes CVE-2022-42719.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50831 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
