Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: broadcom: bcm4908_enet: update TX stats after actual transmission

Queueing packets doesn't guarantee their transmission. Update TX stats
after hardware confirms consuming submitted data.

This also fixes a possible race and NULL dereference.
bcm4908_enet_start_xmit() could try to access skb after freeing it in
the bcm4908_enet_poll_tx().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50877 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c9589e18a60c55c76772a38117ef9a16b942e56b
