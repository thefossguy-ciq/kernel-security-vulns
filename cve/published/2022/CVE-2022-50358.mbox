Subject: CVE-2022-50358: brcmfmac: return error when getting invalid max_flowrings from dongle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

brcmfmac: return error when getting invalid max_flowrings from dongle

When firmware hit trap at initialization, host will read abnormal
max_flowrings number from dongle, and it will cause kernel panic when
doing iowrite to initialize dongle ring.
To detect this error at early stage, we directly return error when getting
invalid max_flowrings(>256).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50358 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
