Subject: CVE-2022-50398: drm/msm/dp: add atomic_check to bridge ops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: add atomic_check to bridge ops

DRM commit_tails() will disable downstream crtc/encoder/bridge if
both disable crtc is required and crtc->active is set before pushing
a new frame downstream.

There is a rare case that user space display manager issue an extra
screen update immediately followed by close DRM device while down
stream display interface is disabled. This extra screen update will
timeout due to the downstream interface is disabled but will cause
crtc->active be set. Hence the followed commit_tails() called by
drm_release() will pass the disable downstream crtc/encoder/bridge
conditions checking even downstream interface is disabled.
This cause the crash to happen at dp_bridge_disable() due to it trying
to access the main link register to push the idle pattern out while main
link clocks is disabled.

This patch adds atomic_check to prevent the extra frame will not
be pushed down if display interface is down so that crtc->active
will not be set neither. This will fail the conditions checking
of disabling down stream crtc/encoder/bridge which prevent
drm_release() from calling dp_bridge_disable() so that crash
at dp_bridge_disable() prevented.

There is no protection in the DRM framework to check if the display
pipeline has been already disabled before trying again. The only
check is the crtc_state->active but this is controlled by usermode
using UAPI. Hence if the usermode sets this and then crashes, the
driver needs to protect against double disable.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
