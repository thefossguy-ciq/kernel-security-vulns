Subject: CVE-2022-49763: ntfs: fix use-after-free in ntfs_attr_find()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: fix use-after-free in ntfs_attr_find()

Patch series "ntfs: fix bugs about Attribute", v2.

This patchset fixes three bugs relative to Attribute in record:

Patch 1 adds a sanity check to ensure that, attrs_offset field in first
mft record loading from disk is within bounds.

Patch 2 moves the ATTR_RECORD's bounds checking earlier, to avoid
dereferencing ATTR_RECORD before checking this ATTR_RECORD is within
bounds.

Patch 3 adds an overflow checking to avoid possible forever loop in
ntfs_attr_find().

Without patch 1 and patch 2, the kernel triggersa KASAN use-after-free
detection as reported by Syzkaller.

Although one of patch 1 or patch 2 can fix this, we still need both of
them.  Because patch 1 fixes the root cause, and patch 2 not only fixes
the direct cause, but also fixes the potential out-of-bounds bug.


This patch (of 3):

Syzkaller reported use-after-free read as follows:

==================================================================

Kernel will loads $MFT/$DATA's first mft record in
ntfs_read_inode_mount().

Yet the problem is that after loading, kernel doesn't check whether
attrs_offset field is a valid value.

To be more specific, if attrs_offset field is larger than bytes_allocated
field, then it may trigger the out-of-bounds read bug(reported as
use-after-free bug) in ntfs_attr_find(), when kernel tries to access the
corresponding mft record's attribute.

This patch solves it by adding the sanity check between attrs_offset field
and bytes_allocated field, after loading the first mft record.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49763 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
