Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix use-after-free when reverting termination table

When having multiple dests with termination tables and second one
or afterwards fails the driver reverts usage of term tables but
doesn't reset the assignment in attr->dests[num_vport_dests].termtbl
which case a use-after-free when releasing the rule.
Fix by resetting the assignment of termtbl to null.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
