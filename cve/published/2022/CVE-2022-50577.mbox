Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: Fix memory leak in __ima_inode_hash()

Commit f3cc6b25dcc5 ("ima: always measure and audit files in policy") lets
measurement or audit happen even if the file digest cannot be calculated.

As a result, iint->ima_hash could have been allocated despite
ima_collect_measurement() returning an error.

Since ima_hash belongs to a temporary inode metadata structure, declared
at the beginning of __ima_inode_hash(), just add a kfree() call if
ima_collect_measurement() returns an error different from -ENOMEM (in that
case, ima_hash should not have been allocated).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50577 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c4df8cb38f139ed9f4296868c0a6f15a26e8c491
