Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: use proper req destructor for IPv6

Before, only the destructor from TCP request sock in IPv4 was called
even if the subflow was IPv6.

It is important to use the right destructor to avoid memory leaks with
some advanced IPv6 features, e.g. when the request socks contain
specific IPv6 options.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50783 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
