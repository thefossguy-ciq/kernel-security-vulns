Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix race where eprobes can be called before the event

The flag that tells the event to call its triggers after reading the event
is set for eprobes after the eprobe is enabled. This leads to a race where
the eprobe may be triggered at the beginning of the event where the record
information is NULL. The eprobe then dereferences the NULL record causing
a NULL kernel pointer bug.

Test for a NULL record to keep this from happening.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7291dec4f2d17a2d3fd1f789fb41e58476539f21
