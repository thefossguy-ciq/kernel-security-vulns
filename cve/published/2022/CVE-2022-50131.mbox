Subject: CVE-2022-50131: HID: mcp2221: prevent a buffer overflow in mcp_smbus_write()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: mcp2221: prevent a buffer overflow in mcp_smbus_write()

Smatch Warning:
drivers/hid/hid-mcp2221.c:388 mcp_smbus_write() error: __memcpy()
'&mcp->txbuf[5]' too small (59 vs 255)
drivers/hid/hid-mcp2221.c:388 mcp_smbus_write() error: __memcpy() 'buf'
too small (34 vs 255)

The 'len' variable can take a value between 0-255 as it can come from
data->block[0] and it is user data. So add an bound check to prevent a
buffer overflow in memcpy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
