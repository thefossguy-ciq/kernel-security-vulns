Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: cake: fix null pointer access issue when cake_init() fails

When the default qdisc is cake, if the qdisc of dev_queue fails to be
inited during mqprio_init(), cake_reset() is invoked to clear
resources. In this case, the tins is NULL, and it will cause gpf issue.

The process is as follows:
qdisc_create_dflt()
	cake_init()
		q->tins = kvcalloc(...)        --->failed, q->tins is NULL
	...
	qdisc_put()
		...
		cake_reset()
			...
			cake_dequeue_one()
				b = &q->tins[...]   --->q->tins is NULL

The following is the Call Trace information:
general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
