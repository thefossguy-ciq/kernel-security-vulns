Subject: CVE-2022-49902: block: Fix possible memory leak for rq_wb on add_disk failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix possible memory leak for rq_wb on add_disk failure

kmemleak reported memory leaks in device_add_disk():

kmemleak: 3 new suspected memory leaks

unreferenced object 0xffff88800f420800 (size 512):
  comm "modprobe", pid 4275, jiffies 4295639067 (age 223.512s)

    [<0000000060e6aab0>] nbd_dev_add+0x828/0xbf0 [nbd]
    ...

It is because the memory allocated in wbt_enable_default() is not
released in device_add_disk() error path.
Normally, these memory are freed in:

del_gendisk()
  rq_qos_exit()
    rqos->ops->exit(rqos);
      wbt_exit()

So rq_qos_exit() is called to free the rq_wb memory for wbt_init().
However in the error path of device_add_disk(), only
blk_unregister_queue() is called and make rq_wb memory leaked.

Add rq_qos_exit() to the error path to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49902 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
