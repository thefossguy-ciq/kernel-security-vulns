Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: smsm: Fix refcount leak bugs in qcom_smsm_probe()

There are two refcount leak bugs in qcom_smsm_probe():

(1) The 'local_node' is escaped out from for_each_child_of_node() as
the break of iteration, we should call of_node_put() for it in error
path or when it is not used anymore.
(2) The 'node' is escaped out from for_each_available_child_of_node()
as the 'goto', we should call of_node_put() for it in goto target.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50703 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
