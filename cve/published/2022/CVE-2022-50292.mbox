Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: fix bridge lifetime

Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.

This can lead resource leaks or failure to bind the aggregate device
when binding is later retried and a second attempt to allocate the
resources is made.

For the DP bridges, previously allocated bridges will leak on probe
deferral.

Fix this by amending the DP parser interface and tying the lifetime of
the bridge device to the DRM device rather than DP platform device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50292 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dp/dp_display.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dp/dp_parser.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/dp/dp_parser.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7eda6977e8058dd45607a5bbc6517a0f42ccd6c9
