Subject: CVE-2022-50433: efi: ssdt: Don't free memory if ACPI table was loaded successfully

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: ssdt: Don't free memory if ACPI table was loaded successfully

Amadeusz reports KASAN use-after-free errors introduced by commit
3881ee0b1edc ("efi: avoid efivars layer when loading SSDTs from
variables"). The problem appears to be that the memory that holds the
new ACPI table is now freed unconditionally, instead of only when the
ACPI core reported a failure to load the table.

So let's fix this, by omitting the kfree() on success.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50433 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
