Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: pn533: Fix use-after-free bugs caused by pn532_cmd_timeout

When the pn532 uart device is detaching, the pn532_uart_remove()
is called. But there are no functions in pn532_uart_remove() that
could delete the cmd_timeout timer, which will cause use-after-free
bugs. The process is shown below:

    (thread 1)                  |        (thread 2)
                                |  pn532_uart_send_frame
pn532_uart_remove               |    mod_timer(&pn532->cmd_timeout,...)
  ...                           |    (wait a time)
  kfree(pn532) //FREE           |    pn532_cmd_timeout
                                |      pn532_uart_send_frame
                                |        pn532->... //USE

This patch adds del_timer_sync() in pn532_uart_remove() in order to
prevent the use-after-free bugs. What's more, the pn53x_unregister_nfc()
is well synchronized, it sets nfc_dev->shutting_down to true and there
are no syscalls could restart the cmd_timeout timer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
