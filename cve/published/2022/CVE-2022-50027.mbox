Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix possible memory leak when failing to issue CMF WQE

There is no corresponding free routine if lpfc_sli4_issue_wqe fails to
issue the CMF WQE in lpfc_issue_cmf_sync_wqe.

If ret_val is non-zero, then free the iocbq request structure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50027 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c8e2e607270a368834a0ef72aa82d970f89c596
