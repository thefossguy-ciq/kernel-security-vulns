Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix memory leak in ocfs2_mount_volume()

There is a memory leak reported by kmemleak:

  unreferenced object 0xffff88810cc65e60 (size 32):
    comm "mount.ocfs2", pid 23753, jiffies 4302528942 (age 34735.105s)
    hex dump (first 32 bytes):

      [<ffffffff8300006a>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

This call stack is related to two problems.  Firstly, the ocfs2 super uses
"replay_map" to trace online/offline slots, in order to recover offline
slots during recovery and mount.  But when ocfs2_truncate_log_init()
returns an error in ocfs2_mount_volume(), the memory of "replay_map" will
not be freed in error handling path.  Secondly, the memory of "replay_map"
will not be freed if d_make_root() returns an error in ocfs2_fill_super().
But the memory of "replay_map" will be freed normally when completing
recovery and mount in ocfs2_complete_mount_recovery().

Fix the first problem by adding error handling path to free "replay_map"
when ocfs2_truncate_log_init() fails.  And fix the second problem by
calling ocfs2_free_replay_slots(osb) in the error handling path
"out_dismount".  In addition, since ocfs2_free_replay_slots() is static,
it is necessary to remove its static attribute and declare it in header
file.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50770 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
