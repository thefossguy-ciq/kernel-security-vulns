Subject: CVE-2022-50876: usb: musb: Fix musb_gadget.c rxstate overflow bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: musb: Fix musb_gadget.c rxstate overflow bug

The usb function device call musb_gadget_queue() adds the passed
request to musb_ep::req_list,If the (request->length > musb_ep->packet_sz)
and (is_buffer_mapped(req) return false),the rxstate() will copy all data
in fifo to request->buf which may cause request->buf out of bounds.

Fix it by add the length check :
fifocnt = min_t(unsigned, request->length - request->actual, fifocnt);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50876 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
