Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra20-slink: fix UAF in tegra_slink_remove()

After calling spi_unregister_master(), the refcount of master will
be decrease to 0, and it will be freed in spi_controller_release(),
the device data also will be freed, so it will lead a UAF when using
'tspi'. To fix this, get the master before unregister and put it when
finish using it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50192 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
