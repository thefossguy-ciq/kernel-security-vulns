Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: do not print NULL LLI during error

During debugging we have seen an issue where axi_chan_dump_lli()
is passed a NULL LLI pointer which ends up causing an OOPS due
to trying to get fields from it. Simply print NULL LLI and exit
to avoid this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50024 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.15.63 with commit af76e6fdcf92f1a742b788d0dba5edd194267bf9

	drivers/dma/dw-axi-dmac/dw-axi-dmac-platform.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/af76e6fdcf92f1a742b788d0dba5edd194267bf9
