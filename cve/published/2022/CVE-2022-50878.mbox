Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpu: lontium-lt9611: Fix NULL pointer dereference in lt9611_connector_init()

A NULL check for bridge->encoder shows that it may be NULL, but it
already been dereferenced on all paths leading to the check.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
