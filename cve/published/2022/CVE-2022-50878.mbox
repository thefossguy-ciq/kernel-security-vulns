Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpu: lontium-lt9611: Fix NULL pointer dereference in lt9611_connector_init()

A NULL check for bridge->encoder shows that it may be NULL, but it
already been dereferenced on all paths leading to the check.
812	if (!bridge->encoder) {

Dereference the pointer bridge->encoder.
810	drm_connector_attach_encoder(&lt9611->connector, bridge->encoder);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50878 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
