Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/region: Fix region HPA ordering validation

Some regions may not have any address space allocated. Skip them when
validating HPA order otherwise a crash like the following may result:

 devm_cxl_add_region: cxl_acpi cxl_acpi.0: decoder3.4: created region9
 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/12316b9f7c18138ae656050cfd716728e27b7e2f
