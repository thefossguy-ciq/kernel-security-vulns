Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4/pnfs: Fix a use-after-free bug in open

If someone cancels the open RPC call, then we must not try to free
either the open slot or the layoutget operation arguments, since they
are likely still in use by the hung RPC call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50072 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
