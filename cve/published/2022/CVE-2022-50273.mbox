Subject: CVE-2022-50273: f2fs: fix to do sanity check on destination blkaddr during recovery

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on destination blkaddr during recovery

As Wenqing Liu reported in bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216456

loop5: detected capacity change from 0 to 131072
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_inode: ino = 6, name = hln, inline = 1
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_data: ino = 6 (i_size: recover) err = 0
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_inode: ino = 6, name = hln, inline = 1
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_data: ino = 6 (i_size: recover) err = 0
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_inode: ino = 6, name = hln, inline = 1
F2FS-fs (loop5): recover_data: ino = 6 (i_size: recover) err = 0
F2FS-fs (loop5): Bitmap was wrongly set, blk:5634

If we enable CONFIG_F2FS_CHECK_FS config, it will trigger a kernel panic
instead of warning.

The root cause is: in fuzzed image, SIT table is inconsistent with inode
mapping table, result in triggering such warning during SIT table update.

This patch introduces a new flag DATA_GENERIC_ENHANCE_UPDATE, w/ this
flag, data block recovery flow can check destination blkaddr's validation
in SIT table, and skip f2fs_replace_block() to avoid inconsistent status.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50273 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
