Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/reclaim: fix potential memory leak in damon_reclaim_init()

damon_reclaim_init() allocates a memory chunk for ctx with
damon_new_ctx().  When damon_select_ops() fails, ctx is not released,
which will lead to a memory leak.

We should release the ctx with damon_destroy_ctx() when damon_select_ops()
fails to fix the memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50088 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
