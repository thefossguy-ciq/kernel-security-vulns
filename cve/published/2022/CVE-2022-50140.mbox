Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memstick/ms_block: Fix a memory leak

'erased_blocks_bitmap' is never freed. As it is allocated at the same time
as 'used_blocks_bitmap', it is likely that it should be freed also at the
same time.

Add the corresponding bitmap_free() in msb_data_clear().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50140 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
