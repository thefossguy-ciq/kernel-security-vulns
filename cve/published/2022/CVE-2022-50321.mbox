Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: fix potential memory leak in brcmf_netdev_start_xmit()

The brcmf_netdev_start_xmit() returns NETDEV_TX_OK without freeing skb
in case of pskb_expand_head() fails, add dev_kfree_skb() to fix it.
Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50321 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
