Subject: CVE-2022-49787: mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix possible memory leak caused by missing pci_dev_put()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix possible memory leak caused by missing pci_dev_put()

pci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned
pci_dev. We need to use pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count
before amd_probe() returns. There is no problem for the 'smbus_dev ==
NULL' branch because pci_dev_put() can also handle the NULL input
parameter case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
