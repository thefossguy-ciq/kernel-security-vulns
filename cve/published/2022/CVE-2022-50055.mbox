Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: Fix adminq error handling

iavf_alloc_asq_bufs/iavf_alloc_arq_bufs allocates with dma_alloc_coherent
memory for VF mailbox.
Free DMA regions for both ASQ and ARQ in case error happens during
configuration of ASQ/ARQ registers.
Without this change it is possible to see when unloading interface:
74626.583369: dma_debug_device_change: device driver has pending DMA allocations while released from device [count=32]
One of leaked entries details: [device address=0x0000000b27ff9000] [size=4096 bytes] [mapped with DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL] [mapped as coherent]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
