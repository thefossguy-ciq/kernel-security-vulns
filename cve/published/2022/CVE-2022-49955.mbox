Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/rtas: Fix RTAS MSR[HV] handling for Cell

The semi-recent changes to MSR handling when entering RTAS (firmware)
cause crashes on IBM Cell machines. An example trace:

  kernel tried to execute user page (2fff01a8) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
  BUG: Unable to handle kernel instruction fetch
  Faulting instruction address: 0x2fff01a8

Unlike PAPR platforms where RTAS is only used in guests, on the IBM Cell
machines Linux runs with MSR[HV] set but also uses RTAS, provided by
SLOF.

Fix it by copying the MSR[HV] bit from the MSR value we've just read
using mfmsr into the value used for RTAS.

It seems like we could also fix it using an #ifdef CELL to set MSR[HV],
but that doesn't work because it's possible to build a single kernel
image that runs on both Cell native and pseries.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49955 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b08d4f97233d8e58fff2fd9d5f86397a49733c5
