Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390: avoid using global register for current_stack_pointer

Commit 30de14b1884b ("s390: current_stack_pointer shouldn't be a
function") made current_stack_pointer a global register variable like
on many other architectures. Unfortunately on s390 it uncovers old
gcc bug which is fixed only since gcc-9.1 [gcc commit 3ad7fed1cc87
("S/390: Fix PR89775. Stackpointer save/restore instructions removed")]
and backported to gcc-8.4 and later. Due to this bug gcc versions prior
to 8.4 generate broken code which leads to stack corruptions.

Current minimal gcc version required to build the kernel is declared
as 5.1. It is not possible to fix all old gcc versions, so work
around this problem by avoiding using global register variable for
current_stack_pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49804 to this issue.

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-49804
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/s390/include/asm/processor.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a478952a8ac44e32316dc046a063a7dc34825aa6
