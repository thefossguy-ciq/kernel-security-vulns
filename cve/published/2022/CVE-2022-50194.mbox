Subject: CVE-2022-50194: soc: qcom: aoss: Fix refcount leak in qmp_cooling_devices_register

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: aoss: Fix refcount leak in qmp_cooling_devices_register

Every iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() decrements
the reference count of the previous node.
When breaking early from a for_each_available_child_of_node() loop,
we need to explicitly call of_node_put() on the child node.
Add missing of_node_put() to avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50194 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
