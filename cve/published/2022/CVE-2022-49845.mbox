Subject: CVE-2022-49845: can: j1939: j1939_send_one(): fix missing CAN header initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: j1939_send_one(): fix missing CAN header initialization

The read access to struct canxl_frame::len inside of a j1939 created
skbuff revealed a missing initialization of reserved and later filled
elements in struct can_frame.

This patch initializes the 8 byte CAN header with zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49845 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
