Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: msc313: Fix function prototype mismatch in msc313_rtc_probe()

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

msc313_rtc_probe() was passing clk_disable_unprepare() directly, which
did not have matching prototypes for devm_add_action_or_reset()'s
callback argument. Refactor to use devm_clk_get_enabled() instead.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50322 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/rtc/rtc-msc313.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5affaaf3334c9274131dae889ed79ea0553d61b4
