Subject: CVE-2022-50250: regulator: core: fix use_count leakage when handling boot-on

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: fix use_count leakage when handling boot-on

I found a use_count leakage towards supply regulator of rdev with
boot-on option.

┌───────────────────┐           ┌───────────────────┐
│  regulator_dev A  │           │  regulator_dev B  │
│     (boot-on)     │           │     (boot-on)     │
│    use_count=0    │◀──supply──│    use_count=1    │
│                   │           │                   │
└───────────────────┘           └───────────────────┘

In case of rdev(A) configured with `regulator-boot-on', the use_count
of supplying regulator(B) will increment inside
regulator_enable(rdev->supply).

Thus, B will acts like always-on, and further balanced
regulator_enable/disable cannot actually disable it anymore.

However, B was also configured with `regulator-boot-on', we wish it
could be disabled afterwards.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50250 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
