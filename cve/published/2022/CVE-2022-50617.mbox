Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu/powerplay/psm: Fix memory leak in power state init

Commit 902bc65de0b3 ("drm/amdgpu/powerplay/psm: return an error in power
state init") made the power state init function return early in case of
failure to get an entry from the powerplay table, but it missed to clean up
the allocated memory for the current power state before returning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50617 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
