Subject: CVE-2022-50730: ext4: silence the warning when evicting inode with dioread_nolock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: silence the warning when evicting inode with dioread_nolock

When evicting an inode with default dioread_nolock, it could be raced by
the unwritten extents converting kworker after writeback some new
allocated dirty blocks. It convert unwritten extents to written, the
extents could be merged to upper level and free extent blocks, so it
could mark the inode dirty again even this inode has been marked
I_FREEING. But the inode->i_io_list check and warning in
ext4_evict_inode() missing this corner case. Fortunately,
ext4_evict_inode() will wait all extents converting finished before this
check, so it will not lead to inode use-after-free problem, every thing
is OK besides this warning. The WARN_ON_ONCE was originally designed
for finding inode use-after-free issues in advance, but if we add
current dioread_nolock case in, it will become not quite useful, so fix
this warning by just remove this check.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
