Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: sysmon: fix memory leak in qcom_add_sysmon_subdev()

The kfree() should be called when of_irq_get_byname() fails or
devm_request_threaded_irq() fails in qcom_add_sysmon_subdev(),
otherwise there will be a memory leak, so add kfree() to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50836 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
