Subject: CVE-2022-49110: netfilter: conntrack: revisit gc autotuning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: revisit gc autotuning

as of commit 4608fdfc07e1
("netfilter: conntrack: collect all entries in one cycle")
conntrack gc was changed to run every 2 minutes.

On systems where conntrack hash table is set to large value, most evictions
happen from gc worker rather than the packet path due to hash table
distribution.

This causes netlink event overflows when events are collected.

This change collects average expiry of scanned entries and
reschedules to the average remaining value, within 1 to 60 second interval.

To avoid event overflows, reschedule after each bucket and add a
limit for both run time and number of evictions per run.

If more entries have to be evicted, reschedule and restart 1 jiffy
into the future.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
