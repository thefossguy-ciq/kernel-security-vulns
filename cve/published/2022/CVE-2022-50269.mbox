Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vkms: Fix memory leak in vkms_init()

A memory leak was reported after the vkms module install failed.

unreferenced object 0xffff88810bc28520 (size 16):
  comm "modprobe", pid 9662, jiffies 4298009455 (age 42.590s)
  hex dump (first 16 bytes):
    01 01 00 64 81 88 ff ff 00 00 dc 0a 81 88 ff ff  ...d............
  backtrace:
    [<00000000e7561ff8>] kmalloc_trace+0x27/0x60
    [<000000000b1954a0>] 0xffffffffc45200a9

    [<000000001505ee87>] do_init_module+0x1a4/0x680

    [<000000008fc6fcde>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

The reason is that the vkms_init() returns without checking the return
value of vkms_create(), and if the vkms_create() failed, the config
allocated at the beginning of vkms_init() is leaked.

 vkms_init()
   config = kmalloc(...) # config allocated
   ...
   return vkms_create() # vkms_create failed and config is leaked

Fix this problem by checking return value of vkms_create() and free the
config if error happened.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
