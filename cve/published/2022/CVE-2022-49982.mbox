Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pvrusb2: fix memory leak in pvr_probe

The error handling code in pvr2_hdw_create forgets to unregister the
v4l2 device. When pvr2_hdw_create returns back to pvr2_context_create,
it calls pvr2_context_destroy to destroy context, but mp->hdw is NULL,
which leads to that pvr2_hdw_destroy directly returns.

Fix this by adding v4l2_device_unregister to decrease the refcount of
usb interface.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
