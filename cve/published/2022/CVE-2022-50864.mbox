Subject: CVE-2022-50864: nilfs2: fix shift-out-of-bounds due to too large exponent of block size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix shift-out-of-bounds due to too large exponent of block size

If field s_log_block_size of superblock data is corrupted and too large,
init_nilfs() and load_nilfs() still can trigger a shift-out-of-bounds
warning followed by a kernel panic (if panic_on_warn is set):

 shift exponent 38973 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  dump_stack_lvl+0xcd/0x134
  ubsan_epilogue+0xb/0x50
  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds.cold.12+0x17b/0x1f5
  init_nilfs.cold.11+0x18/0x1d [nilfs2]
  nilfs_mount+0x9b5/0x12b0 [nilfs2]
  ...

This fixes the issue by adding and using a new helper function for getting
block size with sanity check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
