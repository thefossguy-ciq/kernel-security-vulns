Subject: CVE-2022-49831: btrfs: zoned: initialize device's zone info for seeding

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: initialize device's zone info for seeding

When performing seeding on a zoned filesystem it is necessary to
initialize each zoned device's btrfs_zoned_device_info structure,
otherwise mounting the filesystem will cause a NULL pointer dereference.

This was uncovered by fstests' testcase btrfs/163.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49831 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.15.79 with commit 91c38504e589dadbcde47b1cacdfc5b684154d44

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
