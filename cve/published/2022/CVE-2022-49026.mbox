Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

e100: Fix possible use after free in e100_xmit_prepare

In e100_xmit_prepare(), if we can't map the skb, then return -ENOMEM, so
e100_xmit_frame() will return NETDEV_TX_BUSY and the upper layer will
resend the skb. But the skb is already freed, which will cause UAF bug
when the upper layer resends the skb.

Remove the harmful free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49026 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
