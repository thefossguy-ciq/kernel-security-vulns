Subject: CVE-2022-50516: fs: dlm: fix invalid derefence of sb_lvbptr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: dlm: fix invalid derefence of sb_lvbptr

I experience issues when putting a lkbsb on the stack and have sb_lvbptr
field to a dangled pointer while not using DLM_LKF_VALBLK. It will crash
with the following kernel message, the dangled pointer is here
0xdeadbeef as example:

This patch fixes the issue by checking also on DLM_LKF_VALBLK on exflags
is set when copying the lvbptr array instead of if it's just null which
fixes for me the issue.

I think this patch can fix other dlm users as well, depending how they
handle the init, freeing memory handling of sb_lvbptr and don't set
DLM_LKF_VALBLK for some dlm_lock() calls. It might a there could be a
hidden issue all the time. However with checking on DLM_LKF_VALBLK the
user always need to provide a sb_lvbptr non-null value. There might be
more intelligent handling between per ls lvblen, DLM_LKF_VALBLK and
non-null to report the user the way how DLM API is used is wrong but can
be added for later, this will only fix the current behaviour.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50516 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
