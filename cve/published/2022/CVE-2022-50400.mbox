Subject: CVE-2022-50400: staging: greybus: audio_helper: remove unused and wrong debugfs usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: greybus: audio_helper: remove unused and wrong debugfs usage

In the greybus audio_helper code, the debugfs file for the dapm has the
potential to be removed and memory will be leaked.  There is also the
very real potential for this code to remove ALL debugfs entries from the
system, and it seems like this is what will really happen if this code
ever runs.  This all is very wrong as the greybus audio driver did not
create this debugfs file, the sound core did and controls the lifespan
of it.

So remove all of the debugfs logic from the audio_helper code as there's
no way it could be correct.  If this really is needed, it can come back
with a fixup for the incorrect usage of the debugfs_lookup() call which
is what caused this to be noticed at all.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50400 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
