Subject: CVE-2022-49772: ALSA: usb-audio: Drop snd_BUG_ON() from snd_usbmidi_output_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Drop snd_BUG_ON() from snd_usbmidi_output_open()

snd_usbmidi_output_open() has a check of the NULL port with
snd_BUG_ON().  snd_BUG_ON() was used as this shouldn't have happened,
but in reality, the NULL port may be seen when the device gives an
invalid endpoint setup at the descriptor, hence the driver skips the
allocation.  That is, the check itself is valid and snd_BUG_ON()
should be dropped from there.  Otherwise it's confusing as if it were
a real bug, as recently syzbot stumbled on it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49772 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
