Subject: CVE-2022-49925: RDMA/core: Fix null-ptr-deref in ib_core_cleanup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Fix null-ptr-deref in ib_core_cleanup()

KASAN reported a null-ptr-deref error:

  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000118-0x000000000000011f]
  CPU: 1 PID: 379
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)
  RIP: 0010:destroy_workqueue+0x2f/0x740
  RSP: 0018:ffff888016137df8 EFLAGS: 00000202
  ...
  Call Trace:
   ib_core_cleanup+0xa/0xa1 [ib_core]
   __do_sys_delete_module.constprop.0+0x34f/0x5b0
   do_syscall_64+0x3a/0x90
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd
  RIP: 0033:0x7fa1a0d221b7
  ...

It is because the fail of roce_gid_mgmt_init() is ignored:

 ib_core_init()
   roce_gid_mgmt_init()
     gid_cache_wq = alloc_ordered_workqueue # fail
 ...
 ib_core_cleanup()
   roce_gid_mgmt_cleanup()
     destroy_workqueue(gid_cache_wq)
     # destroy an unallocated wq

Fix this by catching the fail of roce_gid_mgmt_init() in ib_core_init().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49925 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
