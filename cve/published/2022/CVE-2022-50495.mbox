Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/xen: Fix memory leak in xen_smp_intr_init{_pv}()

These local variables @{resched|pmu|callfunc...}_name saves the new
string allocated by kasprintf(), and when bind_{v}ipi_to_irqhandler()
fails, it goes to the @fail tag, and calls xen_smp_intr_free{_pv}() to
free resource, however the new string is not saved, which cause a memory
leak issue. fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50495 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
