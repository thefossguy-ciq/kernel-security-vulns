Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: designware: use casting of u64 in clock multiplication to avoid overflow

In functions i2c_dw_scl_lcnt() and i2c_dw_scl_hcnt() may have overflow
by depending on the values of the given parameters including the ic_clk.
For example in our use case where ic_clk is larger than one million,
multiplication of ic_clk * 4700 will result in 32 bit overflow.

Add cast of u64 to the calculation to avoid multiplication overflow, and
use the corresponding define for divide.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49749 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
