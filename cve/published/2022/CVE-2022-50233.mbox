Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: eir: Fix using strlen with hdev->{dev_name,short_name}

Both dev_name and short_name are not guaranteed to be NULL terminated so
this instead use strnlen and then attempt to determine if the resulting
string needs to be truncated or not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50233 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.0 with commit dd7b8cdde098cf9f7c8de409b5b7bbb98f97be80

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-50233
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/bluetooth/eir.c
	net/bluetooth/mgmt.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd7b8cdde098cf9f7c8de409b5b7bbb98f97be80
