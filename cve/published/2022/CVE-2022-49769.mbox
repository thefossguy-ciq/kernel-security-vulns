Subject: CVE-2022-49769: gfs2: Check sb_bsize_shift after reading superblock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Check sb_bsize_shift after reading superblock

Fuzzers like to scribble over sb_bsize_shift but in reality it's very
unlikely that this field would be corrupted on its own. Nevertheless it
should be checked to avoid the possibility of messy mount errors due to
bad calculations. It's always a fixed value based on the block size so
we can just check that it's the expected value.

Tested with:

    mkfs.gfs2 -O -p lock_nolock /dev/vdb
    for i in 0 -1 64 65 32 33; do
        gfs2_edit -p sb field sb_bsize_shift $i /dev/vdb
        mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test && umount /mnt/test
    done

Before this patch we get a withdraw after

[   76.413681] gfs2: fsid=loop0.0: fatal: invalid metadata block
[   76.413681]   bh = 19 (type: exp=5, found=4)
[   76.413681]   function = gfs2_meta_buffer, file = fs/gfs2/meta_io.c, line = 492

and with UBSAN configured we also get complaints like

[   76.373395] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/gfs2/ops_fstype.c:295:19
[   76.373815] shift exponent 4294967287 is too large for 64-bit type 'long unsigned int'

After the patch, these complaints don't appear, mount fails immediately
and we get an explanation in dmesg.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49769 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
