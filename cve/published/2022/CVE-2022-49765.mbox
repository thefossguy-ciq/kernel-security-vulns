Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/9p: use a dedicated spinlock for trans_fd

Shamelessly copying the explanation from Tetsuo Handa's suggested
patch[1] (slightly reworded):
syzbot is reporting inconsistent lock state in p9_req_put()[2],
for p9_tag_remove() from p9_req_put() from IRQ context is using
spin_lock_irqsave() on "struct p9_client"->lock but trans_fd
(not from IRQ context) is using spin_lock().

Since the locks actually protect different things in client.c and in
trans_fd.c, just replace trans_fd.c's lock by a new one specific to the
transport (client.c's protect the idr for fid/tag allocations,
while trans_fd.c's protects its own req list and request status field
that acts as the transport's state machine)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49765 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/9p/trans_fd.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
