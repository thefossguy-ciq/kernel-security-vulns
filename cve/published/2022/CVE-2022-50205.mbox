Subject: CVE-2022-50205: ext2: Add more validity checks for inode counts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext2: Add more validity checks for inode counts

Add checks verifying number of inodes stored in the superblock matches
the number computed from number of inodes per group. Also verify we have
at least one block worth of inodes per group. This prevents crashes on
corrupted filesystems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50205 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
