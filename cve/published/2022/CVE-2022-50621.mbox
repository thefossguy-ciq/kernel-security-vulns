Subject: CVE-2022-50621: dm: verity-loadpin: Only trust verity targets with enforcement

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: verity-loadpin: Only trust verity targets with enforcement

Verity targets can be configured to ignore corrupted data blocks.
LoadPin must only trust verity targets that are configured to
perform some kind of enforcement when data corruption is detected,
like returning an error, restarting the system or triggering a
panic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50621 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
