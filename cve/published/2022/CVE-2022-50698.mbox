Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: da7219: Fix an error handling path in da7219_register_dai_clks()

If clk_hw_register() fails, the corresponding clk should not be
unregistered.

To handle errors from loops, clean up partial iterations before doing the
goto.  So add a clk_hw_unregister().
Then use a while (--i >= 0) loop in the unwind section.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50698 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
