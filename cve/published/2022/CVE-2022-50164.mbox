Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix double list_add at iwl_mvm_mac_wake_tx_queue

After successfull station association, if station queues are disabled for
some reason, the related lists are not emptied. So if some new element is
added to the list in iwl_mvm_mac_wake_tx_queue, it can match with the old
one and produce a BUG like this:

[   46.535263] list_add corruption. prev->next should be next (ffff94c1c318a360), but was 0000000000000000. (prev=ffff94c1d02d3388).

In order to avoid this problem, we must also remove the related lists when
station queues are disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50164 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
