Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix general-protection-fault in ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()

When device is running and the interface status is changed, the gpf issue
is triggered. The problem triggering process is as follows:
Thread A:                           Thread B
ieee80211_runtime_change_iftype()   process_one_work()
    ...                                 ...
    ieee80211_do_stop()                 ...
    ...                                 ...
        sdata->bss = NULL               ...
        ...                             ieee80211_subif_start_xmit()
                                            ieee80211_multicast_to_unicast
                                    //!sdata->bss->multicast_to_unicast
                                      cause gpf issue

When the interface status is changed, the sending queue continues to send
packets. After the bss is set to NULL, the bss is accessed. As a result,
this causes a general-protection-fault issue.

The following is the stack information:
general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03eb68c72cee249aeb7af7d04a83c033aca3d6d9
