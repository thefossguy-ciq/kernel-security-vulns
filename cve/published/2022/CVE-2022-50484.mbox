Subject: CVE-2022-50484: ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks

When the driver hits -ENOMEM at allocating a URB or a buffer, it
aborts and goes to the error path that releases the all previously
allocated resources.  However, when -ENOMEM hits at the middle of the
sync EP URB allocation loop, the partially allocated URBs might be
left without released, because ep->nurbs is still zero at that point.

Fix it by setting ep->nurbs at first, so that the error handler loops
over the full URB list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50484 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
