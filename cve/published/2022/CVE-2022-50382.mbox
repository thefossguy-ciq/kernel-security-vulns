Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: Always leave BHs disabled when running ->parallel()

A deadlock can happen when an overloaded system runs ->parallel() in the
context of the current task:

    padata_do_parallel
      ->parallel()
        pcrypt_aead_enc/dec
          padata_do_serial
            spin_lock(&reorder->lock) // BHs still enabled
              <interrupt>
                ...
                  __do_softirq
                    ...
                      padata_do_serial
                        spin_lock(&reorder->lock)

It's a bug for BHs to be on in _do_serial as Steffen points out, so
ensure they're off in the "current task" case like they are in
padata_parallel_worker to avoid this situation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50382 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
