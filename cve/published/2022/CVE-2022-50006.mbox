Subject: CVE-2022-50006: NFSv4.2 fix problems with __nfs42_ssc_open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4.2 fix problems with __nfs42_ssc_open

A destination server while doing a COPY shouldn't accept using the
passed in filehandle if its not a regular filehandle.

If alloc_file_pseudo() has failed, we need to decrement a reference
on the newly created inode, otherwise it leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50006 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
