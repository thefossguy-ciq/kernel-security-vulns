Subject: CVE-2022-50815: ext2: Add sanity checks for group and filesystem size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext2: Add sanity checks for group and filesystem size

Add sanity check that filesystem size does not exceed the underlying
device size and that group size is big enough so that metadata can fit
into it. This avoid trying to mount some crafted filesystems with
extremely large group counts.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
