Subject: CVE-2022-49815: erofs: fix missing xas_retry() in fscache mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix missing xas_retry() in fscache mode

The xarray iteration only holds the RCU read lock and thus may encounter
XA_RETRY_ENTRY if there's process modifying the xarray concurrently.
This will cause oops when referring to the invalid entry.

Fix this by adding the missing xas_retry(), which will make the
iteration wind back to the root node if XA_RETRY_ENTRY is encountered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dbc98fe99e17ed18f2f272d5fe880d844b1c68c3
