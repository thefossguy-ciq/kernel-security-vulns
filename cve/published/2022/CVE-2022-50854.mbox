===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: virtual_ncidev: Fix memory leak in virtual_nci_send()

skb should be free in virtual_nci_send(), otherwise kmemleak will report
memleak.

Steps for reproduction (simulated in qemu):
	cd tools/testing/selftests/nci
	make
	./nci_dev

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/88e879c9f59511174ef0ab1a3c9c83e2dbf8a213
