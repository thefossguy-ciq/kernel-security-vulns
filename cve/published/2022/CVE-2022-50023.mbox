Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: ignore interrupt if no descriptor

If the channel has no descriptor and the interrupt is raised then the
kernel will OOPS. Check the result of vchan_next_desc() in the handler
axi_chan_block_xfer_complete() to avoid the error happening.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50023 to this issue.

	drivers/dma/dw-axi-dmac/dw-axi-dmac-platform.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/54aa6c49361b79f7f6b15fc63dfe9ea52c70bb03
