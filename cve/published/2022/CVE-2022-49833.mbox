Subject: CVE-2022-49833: btrfs: zoned: clone zoned device info when cloning a device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: clone zoned device info when cloning a device

When cloning a btrfs_device, we're not cloning the associated
btrfs_zoned_device_info structure of the device in case of a zoned
filesystem.

Later on this leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the
device's zone_info for instance when setting a zone as active.

This was uncovered by fstests' testcase btrfs/161.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49833 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
