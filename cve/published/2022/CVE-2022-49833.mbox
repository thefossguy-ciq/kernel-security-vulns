Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: clone zoned device info when cloning a device

When cloning a btrfs_device, we're not cloning the associated
btrfs_zoned_device_info structure of the device in case of a zoned
filesystem.

Later on this leads to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the
device's zone_info for instance when setting a zone as active.

This was uncovered by fstests' testcase btrfs/161.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49833 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.0.9 with commit ad88cabcec942c033f980cd1e28d56ecdaf5f3b8
	Fixed in 6.1 with commit 21e61ec6d0bb786818490e926aa9aeb4de95ad0d

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-49833
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/btrfs/volumes.c
	fs/btrfs/zoned.c
	fs/btrfs/zoned.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ad88cabcec942c033f980cd1e28d56ecdaf5f3b8
