Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/binfmt_elf: Fix memory leak in load_elf_binary()

There is a memory leak reported by kmemleak:

  unreferenced object 0xffff88817104ef80 (size 224):
    comm "xfs_admin", pid 47165, jiffies 4298708825 (age 1333.476s)
    hex dump (first 32 bytes):
      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
      60 a8 b3 00 81 88 ff ff a8 10 5a 00 81 88 ff ff  `.........Z.....
    backtrace:

      [<ffffffff83bbf0a5>] do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80

If "interp_elf_ex" fails to allocate memory in load_elf_binary(),
the program will take the "out_free_ph" error handing path,
resulting in "interpreter" file resource is not released.

Fix it by adding an error handing path "out_free_file", which will
release the file resource when "interp_elf_ex" failed to allocate
memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50466 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
