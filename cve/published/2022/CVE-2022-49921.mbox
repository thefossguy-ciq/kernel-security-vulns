Subject: CVE-2022-49921: net: sched: Fix use after free in red_enqueue()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: Fix use after free in red_enqueue()

We can't use "skb" again after passing it to qdisc_enqueue().  This is
basically identical to commit 2f09707d0c97 ("sch_sfb: Also store skb
len before calling child enqueue").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49921 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
