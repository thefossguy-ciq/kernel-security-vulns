Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binfmt_misc: fix shift-out-of-bounds in check_special_flags

UBSAN reported a shift-out-of-bounds warning:

 left shift of 1 by 31 places cannot be represented in type 'int'
 Call Trace:

 RIP: 0033:0x4194e1

Since the type of Node's flags is unsigned long, we should define these
macros with same type too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50497 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
