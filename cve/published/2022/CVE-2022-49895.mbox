Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/region: Fix decoder allocation crash

When an intermediate port's decoders have been exhausted by existing
regions, and creating a new region with the port in question in it's
hierarchical path is attempted, cxl_port_attach_region() fails to find a
port decoder (as would be expected), and drops into the failure / cleanup
path.

However, during cleanup of the region reference, a sanity check attempts
to dereference the decoder, which in the above case didn't exist. This
causes a NULL pointer dereference BUG.

To fix this, refactor the decoder allocation and de-allocation into
helper routines, and in this 'free' routine, check that the decoder,
@cxld, is valid before attempting any operations on it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49895 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/cxl/core/region.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6813b5610ac53af73edd87a660d23a0511faa47
