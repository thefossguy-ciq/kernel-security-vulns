Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix memory leak in __qlt_24xx_handle_abts()

Commit 8f394da36a36 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Drop TARGET_SCF_LOOKUP_LUN_FROM_TAG")
made the __qlt_24xx_handle_abts() function return early if
tcm_qla2xxx_find_cmd_by_tag() didn't find a command, but it missed to clean
up the allocated memory for the management command.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48650 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
