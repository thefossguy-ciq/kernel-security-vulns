Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/ttm: don't leak the ccs state

The kernel only manages the ccs state with lmem-only objects, however
the kernel should still take care not to leak the CCS state from the
previous user.

(cherry picked from commit 353819d85f87be46aeb9c1dd929d445a006fc6ec)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50037 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b431cffb4883b9e90d48f0c408674c50fef428a5
