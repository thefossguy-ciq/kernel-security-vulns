Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Use __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D bits

Use the recently introduced __try_cmpxchg_user() to update guest PTE A/D
bits instead of mapping the PTE into kernel address space.  The VM_PFNMAP
path is broken as it assumes that vm_pgoff is the base pfn of the mapped
VMA range, which is conceptually wrong as vm_pgoff is the offset relative
to the file and has nothing to do with the pfn.  The horrific hack worked
for the original use case (backing guest memory with /dev/mem), but leads
to accessing "random" pfns for pretty much any other VM_PFNMAP case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49562 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38b888911e8dc89b89d8147cfb1d2dbe6373bf78
