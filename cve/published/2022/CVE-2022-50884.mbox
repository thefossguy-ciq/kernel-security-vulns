Subject: CVE-2022-50884: drm: Prevent drm_copy_field() to attempt copying a NULL pointer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: Prevent drm_copy_field() to attempt copying a NULL pointer

There are some struct drm_driver fields that are required by drivers since
drm_copy_field() attempts to copy them to user-space via DRM_IOCTL_VERSION.

But it can be possible that a driver has a bug and did not set some of the
fields, which leads to drm_copy_field() attempting to copy a NULL pointer:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
