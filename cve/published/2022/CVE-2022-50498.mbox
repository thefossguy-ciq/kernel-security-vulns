Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: alx: take rtnl_lock on resume

Zbynek reports that alx trips an rtnl assertion on resume:

 RTNL: assertion failed at net/core/dev.c (2891)
 RIP: 0010:netif_set_real_num_tx_queues+0x1ac/0x1c0
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  __alx_open+0x230/0x570 [alx]
  alx_resume+0x54/0x80 [alx]
  ? pci_legacy_resume+0x80/0x80
  dpm_run_callback+0x4a/0x150

  async_resume+0x19/0x30
  async_run_entry_fn+0x30/0x130
  process_one_work+0x1e5/0x3b0

indeed the driver does not hold rtnl_lock during its internal close
and re-open functions during suspend/resume. Note that this is not
a huge bug as the driver implements its own locking, and does not
implement changing the number of queues, but we need to silence
the splat.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50498 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
