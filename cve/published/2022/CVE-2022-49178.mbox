Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memstick/mspro_block: fix handling of read-only devices

Use set_disk_ro to propagate the read-only state to the block layer
instead of checking for it in ->open and leaking a reference in case
of a read-only device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49178 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/057b53c4f87690d626203acef8b63d52a9bf2f43
