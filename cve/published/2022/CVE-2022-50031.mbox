Subject: CVE-2022-50031: scsi: iscsi: Fix HW conn removal use after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi: Fix HW conn removal use after free

If qla4xxx doesn't remove the connection before the session, the iSCSI
class tries to remove the connection for it. We were doing a
iscsi_put_conn() in the iter function which is not needed and will result
in a use after free because iscsi_remove_conn() will free the connection.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50031 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.19.4 with commit 0483ffc02ebb953124c592485a5c48ac4ffae5fe
	Fixed in 6.0 with commit c577ab7ba5f3bf9062db8a58b6e89d4fe370447e

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-50031
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0483ffc02ebb953124c592485a5c48ac4ffae5fe
