Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: OMAP2+: omap4-common: Fix refcount leak bug

In omap4_sram_init(), of_find_compatible_node() will return a node
pointer with refcount incremented. We should use of_node_put() when
it is not used anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50539 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.16 with commit 1d9452ae3bdb830f9309cf10a2f65977999cb14e

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d9452ae3bdb830f9309cf10a2f65977999cb14e
