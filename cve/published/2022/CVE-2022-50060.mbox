Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-af: Fix mcam entry resource leak

The teardown sequence in FLR handler returns if no NIX LF
is attached to PF/VF because it indicates that graceful
shutdown of resources already happened. But there is a
chance of all allocated MCAM entries not being freed by
PF/VF. Hence free mcam entries even in case of detached LF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50060 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
