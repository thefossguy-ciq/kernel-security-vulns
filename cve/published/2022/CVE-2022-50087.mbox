Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scpi: Ensure scpi_info is not assigned if the probe fails

When scpi probe fails, at any point, we need to ensure that the scpi_info
is not set and will remain NULL until the probe succeeds. If it is not
taken care, then it could result use-after-free as the value is exported
via get_scpi_ops() and could refer to a memory allocated via devm_kzalloc()
but freed when the probe fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
