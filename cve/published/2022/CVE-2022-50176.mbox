Subject: CVE-2022-50176: drm/mcde: Fix refcount leak in mcde_dsi_bind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mcde: Fix refcount leak in mcde_dsi_bind

Every iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() decrements
the reference counter of the previous node. There is no decrement
when break out from the loop and results in refcount leak.
Add missing of_node_put() to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
