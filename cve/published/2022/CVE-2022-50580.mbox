Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-throttle: prevent overflow while calculating wait time

There is a problem found by code review in tg_with_in_bps_limit() that
'bps_limit * jiffy_elapsed_rnd' might overflow. Fix the problem by
calling mul_u64_u64_div_u64() instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50580 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
