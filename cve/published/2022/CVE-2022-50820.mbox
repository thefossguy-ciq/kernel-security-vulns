Subject: CVE-2022-50820: perf/arm_dmc620: Fix hotplug callback leak in dmc620_pmu_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/arm_dmc620: Fix hotplug callback leak in dmc620_pmu_init()

dmc620_pmu_init() won't remove the callback added by
cpuhp_setup_state_multi() when platform_driver_register() failed. Remove
the callback by cpuhp_remove_multi_state() in fail path.

Similar to the handling of arm_ccn_init() in commit 26242b330093 ("bus:
arm-ccn: Prevent hotplug callback leak")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50820 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
