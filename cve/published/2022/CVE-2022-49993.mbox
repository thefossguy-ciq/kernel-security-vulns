Subject: CVE-2022-49993: loop: Check for overflow while configuring loop

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: Check for overflow while configuring loop

The userspace can configure a loop using an ioctl call, wherein
a configuration of type loop_config is passed (see lo_ioctl()'s
case on line 1550 of drivers/block/loop.c). This proceeds to call
loop_configure() which in turn calls loop_set_status_from_info()
(see line 1050 of loop.c), passing &config->info which is of type
loop_info64*. This function then sets the appropriate values, like
the offset.

loop_device has lo_offset of type loff_t (see line 52 of loop.c),
which is typdef-chained to long long, whereas loop_info64 has
lo_offset of type __u64 (see line 56 of include/uapi/linux/loop.h).

The function directly copies offset from info to the device as
follows (See line 980 of loop.c):
	lo->lo_offset = info->lo_offset;

This results in an overflow, which triggers a warning in iomap_iter()
due to a call to iomap_iter_done() which has:
	WARN_ON_ONCE(iter->iomap.offset > iter->pos);

Thus, check for negative value during loop_set_status_from_info().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
