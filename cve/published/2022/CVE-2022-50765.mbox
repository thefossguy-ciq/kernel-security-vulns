Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RISC-V: kexec: Fix memory leak of elf header buffer

This is reported by kmemleak detector:

unreferenced object 0xff2000000403d000 (size 4096):
  comm "kexec", pid 146, jiffies 4294900633 (age 64.792s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):

    [<0000000040c62c03>] ret_from_syscall+0x0/0x2

In elf_kexec_load(), a buffer is allocated via vzalloc() to store elf
headers.  While it's not freed back to system when kdump kernel is
reloaded or unloaded, or when image->elf_header is successfully set and
then fails to load kdump kernel for some reason. Fix it by freeing the
buffer in arch_kimage_file_post_load_cleanup().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50765 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
