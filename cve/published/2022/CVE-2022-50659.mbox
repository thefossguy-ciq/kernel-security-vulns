Subject: CVE-2022-50659: hwrng: geode - Fix PCI device refcount leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwrng: geode - Fix PCI device refcount leak

for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of
pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the
returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input
pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.

If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call
pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. We add a new struct
'amd_geode_priv' to record pointer of the pci_dev and membase, and then
add missing pci_dev_put() for the normal and error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50659 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
