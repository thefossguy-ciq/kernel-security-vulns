This is because in scatterwalk_copychunks(), we attempted to write to
a buffer (@sign) that was allocated in the stack (vmalloc area) by
crypt_message() and thus accessing its remaining 8 (x2) bytes ended up
crossing a page boundary.

To simply fix it, we could just pass @sign kmalloc'd from
crypt_message() and then we're done.  Luckily, we don't seem to pass
any other vmalloc'd buffers in smb_rqst::rq_iov...

Instead, let's map the correct pages and offsets from vmalloc buffers
as well in cifs_sg_set_buf() and then avoiding such oopses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50341 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
