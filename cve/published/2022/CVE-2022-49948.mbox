Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt: Clear selection before changing the font

When changing the console font with ioctl(KDFONTOP) the new font size
can be bigger than the previous font. A previous selection may thus now
be outside of the new screen size and thus trigger out-of-bounds
accesses to graphics memory if the selection is removed in
vc_do_resize().

Prevent such out-of-memory accesses by dropping the selection before the
various con_font_set() console handlers are called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49948 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
