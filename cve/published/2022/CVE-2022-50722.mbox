Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ipu3-imgu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in active selection access

What the IMGU driver did was that it first acquired the pointers to active
and try V4L2 subdev state, and only then figured out which one to use.

The problem with that approach and a later patch (see Fixes: tag) is that
as sd_state argument to v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop() et al is NULL, there is
now an attempt to dereference that.

Fix this.

Also rewrap lines a little.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
