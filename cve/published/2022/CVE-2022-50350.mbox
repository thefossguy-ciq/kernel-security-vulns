Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread

In case a malicious initiator sends some random data immediately after a
login PDU; the iscsi_target_sk_data_ready() callback will schedule the
login_work and, at the same time, the negotiation may end without clearing
the LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag (because no additional PDU exchanges are
required to complete the login).

The login has been completed but the login_work function will find the
LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag set and will never stop from rescheduling
itself; at this point, if the initiator drops the connection, the
iscsit_conn structure will be freed, login_work will dereference a released
socket structure and the kernel crashes.

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000230
PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
Workqueue: events iscsi_target_do_login_rx [iscsi_target_mod]
RIP: 0010:_raw_read_lock_bh+0x15/0x30
Call trace:
 iscsi_target_do_login_rx+0x75/0x3f0 [iscsi_target_mod]
 process_one_work+0x1e8/0x3c0

Fix this bug by forcing login_work to stop after the login has been
completed and the socket callbacks have been restored.

Add a comment to clearify the return values of iscsi_target_do_login()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50350 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1533b8b3058db618409f41554ebe768c2e3acfae
