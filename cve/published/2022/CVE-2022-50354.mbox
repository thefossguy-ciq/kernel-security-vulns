Subject: CVE-2022-50354: drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd_process_device_init_vm error handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd_process_device_init_vm error handling

Should only destroy the ib_mem and let process cleanup worker to free
the outstanding BOs. Reset the pointer in pdd->qpd structure, to avoid
NULL pointer access in process destroy worker.

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
