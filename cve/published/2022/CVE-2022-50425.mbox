Subject: CVE-2022-50425: x86/fpu: Fix copy_xstate_to_uabi() to copy init states correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Fix copy_xstate_to_uabi() to copy init states correctly

When an extended state component is not present in fpstate, but in init
state, the function copies from init_fpstate via copy_feature().

But, dynamic states are not present in init_fpstate because of all-zeros
init states. Then retrieving them from init_fpstate will explode like this:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd

Adjust the 'mask' to zero out the userspace buffer for the features that
are not available both from fpstate and from init_fpstate.

The dynamic features depend on the compacted XSAVE format. Ensure it is
enabled before reading XCOMP_BV in init_fpstate.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50425 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/x86/kernel/fpu/xstate.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ff29642fd28965a8f8d6d326ac91bf6075f3113
