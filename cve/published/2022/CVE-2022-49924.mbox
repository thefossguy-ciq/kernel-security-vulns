Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fdp: Fix potential memory leak in fdp_nci_send()

fdp_nci_send() will call fdp_nci_i2c_write that will not free skb in
the function. As a result, when fdp_nci_i2c_write() finished, the skb
will memleak. fdp_nci_send() should free skb after fdp_nci_i2c_write()
finished.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
