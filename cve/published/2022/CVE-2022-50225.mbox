Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv:uprobe fix SR_SPIE set/clear handling

In riscv the process of uprobe going to clear spie before exec
the origin insn,and set spie after that.But When access the page
which origin insn has been placed a page fault may happen and
irq was disabled in arch_uprobe_pre_xol function,It cause a WARN
as follows.
There is no need to clear/set spie in arch_uprobe_pre/post/abort_xol.
We can just remove it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
