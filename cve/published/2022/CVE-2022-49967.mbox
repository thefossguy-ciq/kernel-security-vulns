Subject: CVE-2022-49967: bpf: Fix a data-race around bpf_jit_limit.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix a data-race around bpf_jit_limit.

While reading bpf_jit_limit, it can be changed concurrently via sysctl,
WRITE_ONCE() in __do_proc_doulongvec_minmax(). The size of bpf_jit_limit
is long, so we need to add a paired READ_ONCE() to avoid load-tearing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
