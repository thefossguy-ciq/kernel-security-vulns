Subject: CVE-2022-50666: RDMA/siw: Fix QP destroy to wait for all references dropped.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix QP destroy to wait for all references dropped.

Delay QP destroy completion until all siw references to QP are
dropped. The calling RDMA core will free QP structure after
successful return from siw_qp_destroy() call, so siw must not
hold any remaining reference to the QP upon return.
A use-after-free was encountered in xfstest generic/460, while
testing NFSoRDMA. Here, after a TCP connection drop by peer,
the triggered siw_cm_work_handler got delayed until after
QP destroy call, referencing a QP which has already freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50666 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
