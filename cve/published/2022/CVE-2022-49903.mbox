Subject: CVE-2022-49903: ipv6: fix WARNING in ip6_route_net_exit_late()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix WARNING in ip6_route_net_exit_late()

During the initialization of ip6_route_net_init_late(), if file
ipv6_route or rt6_stats fails to be created, the initialization is
successful by default. Therefore, the ipv6_route or rt6_stats file
doesn't be found during the remove in ip6_route_net_exit_late(). It
will cause WRNING.

The following is the stack information:
name 'rt6_stats'

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
