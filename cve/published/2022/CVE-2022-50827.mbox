Subject: CVE-2022-50827: scsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak in lpfc_create_port()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix memory leak in lpfc_create_port()

Commit 5e633302ace1 ("scsi: lpfc: vmid: Add support for VMID in mailbox
command") introduced allocations for the VMID resources in
lpfc_create_port() after the call to scsi_host_alloc(). Upon failure on the
VMID allocations, the new code would branch to the 'out' label, which
returns NULL without unwinding anything, thus skipping the call to
scsi_host_put().

Fix the problem by creating a separate label 'out_free_vmid' to unwind the
VMID resources and make the 'out_put_shost' label call only
scsi_host_put(), as was done before the introduction of allocations for
VMID.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50827 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
