Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix reference count leak in hswep_has_limit_sbox()

pci_get_device() will increase the reference count for the returned
'dev'. We need to call pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count.
Since 'dev' is only used in pci_read_config_dword(), let's add
pci_dev_put() right after it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50318 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
