Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: via-sdmmc: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()

mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value,
it will lead two issues:
1. The memory that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() is leaked.
2. In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to
   delete device, but it's not added yet, it will lead a kernel
   crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().

Fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which
will call mmc_free_host().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50846 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
