Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Don't remove map on creater_process and device_release

Do not remove the map from the list on error path in
fastrpc_init_create_process, instead call fastrpc_map_put, to avoid
use-after-free. Do not remove it on fastrpc_device_release either,
call fastrpc_map_put instead.

The fastrpc_free_map is the only proper place to remove the map.
This is called only after the reference count is 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48873 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
