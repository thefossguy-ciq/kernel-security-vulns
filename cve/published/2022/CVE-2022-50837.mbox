Subject: CVE-2022-50837: net: dsa: tag_8021q: avoid leaking ctx on dsa_tag_8021q_register() error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: tag_8021q: avoid leaking ctx on dsa_tag_8021q_register() error path

If dsa_tag_8021q_setup() fails, for example due to the inability of the
device to install a VLAN, the tag_8021q context of the switch will leak.
Make sure it is freed on the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50837 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
