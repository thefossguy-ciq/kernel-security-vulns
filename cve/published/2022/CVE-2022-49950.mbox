Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: fix memory corruption on open

The probe session-duplication overflow check incremented the session
count also when there were no more available sessions so that memory
beyond the fixed-size slab-allocated session array could be corrupted in
fastrpc_session_alloc() on open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
