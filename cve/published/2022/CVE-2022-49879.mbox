Subject: CVE-2022-49879: ext4: fix BUG_ON() when directory entry has invalid rec_len

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix BUG_ON() when directory entry has invalid rec_len

The rec_len field in the directory entry has to be a multiple of 4.  A
corrupted filesystem image can be used to hit a BUG() in
ext4_rec_len_to_disk(), called from make_indexed_dir().

 kernel BUG at fs/ext4/ext4.h:2413!

 RIP: 0010:make_indexed_dir+0x53f/0x5f0

The fix simply adds a call to ext4_check_dir_entry() to validate the
directory entry, returning -EFSCORRUPTED if the entry is invalid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
