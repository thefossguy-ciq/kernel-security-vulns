Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpftool: Fix NULL pointer dereference when pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE

When using bpftool to pin {PROG, MAP, LINK} without FILE,
segmentation fault will occur. The reson is that the lack
of FILE will cause strlen to trigger NULL pointer dereference.
The corresponding stacktrace is shown below:

do_pin
  do_pin_any
    do_pin_fd
      mount_bpffs_for_pin
        strlen(name) <- NULL pointer dereference

Fix it by adding validation to the common process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49875 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
