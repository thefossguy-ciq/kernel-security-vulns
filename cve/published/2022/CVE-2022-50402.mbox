Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/md/md-bitmap: check the return value of md_bitmap_get_counter()

Check the return value of md_bitmap_get_counter() in case it returns
NULL pointer, which will result in a null pointer dereference.

v2: update the check to include other dereference

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50402 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
