Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: fix oops in concurrently setting insn_emulation sysctls

emulation_proc_handler() changes table->data for proc_dointvec_minmax
and can generate the following Oops if called concurrently with itself:

 | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
 | Internal error: Oops: 96000006 [#1] SMP
 | Call trace:
 | update_insn_emulation_mode+0xc0/0x148
 | emulation_proc_handler+0x64/0xb8
 | proc_sys_call_handler+0x9c/0xf8
 | proc_sys_write+0x18/0x20
 | __vfs_write+0x20/0x48
 | vfs_write+0xe4/0x1d0
 | ksys_write+0x70/0xf8
 | __arm64_sys_write+0x20/0x28
 | el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x7c/0x1c0
 | el0_svc_handler+0x2c/0xa0
 | el0_svc+0x8/0x200

To fix this issue, keep the table->data as &insn->current_mode and
use container_of() to retrieve the insn pointer. Another mutex is
used to protect against the current_mode update but not for retrieving
insn_emulation as table->data is no longer changing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50206 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
