Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/region: Fix cxl_region leak, cleanup targets at region delete

When a region is deleted any targets that have been previously assigned
to that region hold references to it. Trigger those references to
drop by detaching all targets at unregister_region() time.

Otherwise that region object will leak as userspace has lost the ability
to detach targets once region sysfs is torn down.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49893 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45d9fb4b758b9d602ee7776eb6754b0349946aad
