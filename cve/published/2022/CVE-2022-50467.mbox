Subject: CVE-2022-50467: scsi: lpfc: Fix null ndlp ptr dereference in abnormal exit path for GFT_ID

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix null ndlp ptr dereference in abnormal exit path for GFT_ID

An error case exit from lpfc_cmpl_ct_cmd_gft_id() results in a call to
lpfc_nlp_put() with a null pointer to a nodelist structure.

Changed lpfc_cmpl_ct_cmd_gft_id() to initialize nodelist pointer upon
entry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50467 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
