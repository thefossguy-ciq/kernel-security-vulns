Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-buf: heaps: Fix potential spectre v1 gadget

It appears like nr could be a Spectre v1 gadget as it's supplied by a
user and used as an array index. Prevent the contents
of kernel memory from being leaked to userspace via speculative
execution by using array_index_nospec.

 [sumits: added fixes and cc: stable tags]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48730 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
