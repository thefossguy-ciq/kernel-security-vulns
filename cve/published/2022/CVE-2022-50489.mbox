Subject: CVE-2022-50489: drm/mipi-dsi: Detach devices when removing the host

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mipi-dsi: Detach devices when removing the host

Whenever the MIPI-DSI host is unregistered, the code of
mipi_dsi_host_unregister() loops over every device currently found on that
bus and will unregister it.

However, it doesn't detach it from the bus first, which leads to all kind
of resource leaks if the host wants to perform some clean up whenever a
device is detached.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50489 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
