Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: efct: Fix possible memleak in efct_device_init()

In efct_device_init(), when efct_scsi_reg_fc_transport() fails,
efct_scsi_tgt_driver_exit() is not called to release memory for
efct_scsi_tgt_driver_init() and causes memleak:

unreferenced object 0xffff8881020ce000 (size 2048):
  comm "modprobe", pid 465, jiffies 4294928222 (age 55.872s)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50727 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
