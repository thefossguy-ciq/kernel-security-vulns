Subject: CVE-2022-50000: netfilter: flowtable: fix stuck flows on cleanup due to pending work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable: fix stuck flows on cleanup due to pending work

To clear the flow table on flow table free, the following sequence
normally happens in order:

  1) gc_step work is stopped to disable any further stats/del requests.
  2) All flow table entries are set to teardown state.
  3) Run gc_step which will queue HW del work for each flow table entry.
  4) Waiting for the above del work to finish (flush).
  5) Run gc_step again, deleting all entries from the flow table.
  6) Flow table is freed.

But if a flow table entry already has pending HW stats or HW add work
step 3 will not queue HW del work (it will be skipped), step 4 will wait
for the pending add/stats to finish, and step 5 will queue HW del work
which might execute after freeing of the flow table.

To fix the above, this patch flushes the pending work, then it sets the
teardown flag to all flows in the flowtable and it forces a garbage
collector run to queue work to remove the flows from hardware, then it
flushes this new pending work and (finally) it forces another garbage
collector run to remove the entry from the software flowtable.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
