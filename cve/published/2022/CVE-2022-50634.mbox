Subject: CVE-2022-50634: power: supply: cw2015: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in cw_bat_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: cw2015: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in cw_bat_probe()

cw_bat_probe() calls create_singlethread_workqueue() and not checked the
ret value, which may return NULL. And a null-ptr-deref may happen:

cw_bat_probe()
    create_singlethread_workqueue() # failed, cw_bat->wq is NULL
    queue_delayed_work()
        queue_delayed_work_on()
            __queue_delayed_work()  # warning here, but continue
                __queue_work()      # access wq->flags, null-ptr-deref

Check the ret value and return -ENOMEM if it is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50634 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
