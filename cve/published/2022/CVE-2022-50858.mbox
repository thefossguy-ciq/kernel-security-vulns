Subject: CVE-2022-50858: mmc: alcor: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: alcor: fix return value check of mmc_add_host()

mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value, the memory
that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() will be leaked and it will lead a kernel
crash because of deleting not added device in the remove path.

So fix this by checking the return value and calling mmc_free_host() in the
error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50858 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
