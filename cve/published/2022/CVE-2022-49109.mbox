Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix inode reference leakage in ceph_get_snapdir()

The ceph_get_inode() will search for or insert a new inode into the
hash for the given vino, and return a reference to it. If new is
non-NULL, its reference is consumed.

We should release the reference when in error handing cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49109 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
