Subject: CVE-2022-50305: ASoC: sof_es8336: fix possible use-after-free in sof_es8336_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: sof_es8336: fix possible use-after-free in sof_es8336_remove()

sof_es8336_remove() calls cancel_delayed_work(). However, that
function does not wait until the work function finishes. This
means that the callback function may still be running after
the driver's remove function has finished, which would result
in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which ensures that
the work is properly cancelled, no longer running, and unable
to re-schedule itself.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50305 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
