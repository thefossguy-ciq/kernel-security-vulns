Subject: CVE-2022-50649: power: supply: adp5061: fix out-of-bounds read in adp5061_get_chg_type()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: adp5061: fix out-of-bounds read in adp5061_get_chg_type()

ADP5061_CHG_STATUS_1_CHG_STATUS is masked with 0x07, which means a length
of 8, but adp5061_chg_type array size is 4, may end up reading 4 elements
beyond the end of the adp5061_chg_type[] array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50649 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
