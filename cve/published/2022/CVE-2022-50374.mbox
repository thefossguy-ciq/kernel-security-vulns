Subject: CVE-2022-50374: Bluetooth: hci_{ldisc,serdev}: check percpu_init_rwsem() failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_{ldisc,serdev}: check percpu_init_rwsem() failure

syzbot is reporting NULL pointer dereference at hci_uart_tty_close() [1],
for rcu_sync_enter() is called without rcu_sync_init() due to
hci_uart_tty_open() ignoring percpu_init_rwsem() failure.

While we are at it, fix that hci_uart_register_device() ignores
percpu_init_rwsem() failure and hci_uart_unregister_device() does not
call percpu_free_rwsem().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50374 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
