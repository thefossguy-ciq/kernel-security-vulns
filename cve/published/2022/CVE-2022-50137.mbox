Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Fix a window for use-after-free

During a destroy CQ an interrupt may cause processing of a CQE after CQ
resources are freed by irdma_cq_free_rsrc(). Fix this by moving the call
to irdma_cq_free_rsrc() after the irdma_sc_cleanup_ceqes(), which is
called under the cq_lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50137 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
