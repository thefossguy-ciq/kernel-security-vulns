Subject: CVE-2022-50057: fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL deref in ntfs_update_mftmirr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL deref in ntfs_update_mftmirr

If ntfs_fill_super() wasn't called then sbi->sb will be equal to NULL.
Code should check this ptr before dereferencing. Syzbot hit this issue
via passing wrong mount param as can be seen from log below

Fail log:
ntfs3: Unknown parameter 'iochvrset'
general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000003: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000018-0x000000000000001f]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e8e1a84dac7a3d2b432162a70d7fb6a75960772
