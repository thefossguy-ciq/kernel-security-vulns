Subject: CVE-2022-49896: cxl/pmem: Fix cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/pmem: Fix cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak

When a cxl_nvdimm object goes through a ->remove() event (device
physically removed, nvdimm-bridge disabled, or nvdimm device disabled),
then any associated regions must also be disabled. As highlighted by the
cxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single device may host multiple
regions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This
leads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm
device is cleaned up properly. Other regions are leaked, and this also
causes cxl_memdev reference leaks.

Fix the tracking by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region
associations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49896 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f43b6bfdbab78606735ba81185cf0602b81e40b6
