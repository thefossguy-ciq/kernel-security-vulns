Subject: CVE-2022-49931: IB/hfi1: Correctly move list in sc_disable()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Correctly move list in sc_disable()

Commit 13bac861952a ("IB/hfi1: Fix abba locking issue with sc_disable()")
incorrectly tries to move a list from one list head to another.  The
result is a kernel crash.

The crash is triggered when a link goes down and there are waiters for a
send to complete.  The following signature is seen:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   sc_disable+0x1ba/0x240 [hfi1]
   pio_freeze+0x3d/0x60 [hfi1]
   handle_freeze+0x27/0x1b0 [hfi1]
   process_one_work+0x1b0/0x380
   ? process_one_work+0x380/0x380
   worker_thread+0x30/0x360
   ? process_one_work+0x380/0x380
   kthread+0xd7/0x100
   ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20
   ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30

The fix is to use the correct call to move the list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49931 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
