Subject: CVE-2022-50186: ath11k: fix missing skb drop on htc_tx_completion error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath11k: fix missing skb drop on htc_tx_completion error

On htc_tx_completion error the skb is not dropped. This is wrong since
the completion_handler logic expect the skb to be consumed anyway even
when an error is triggered. Not freeing the skb on error is a memory
leak since the skb won't be freed anywere else. Correctly free the
packet on eid >= ATH11K_HTC_EP_COUNT before returning.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.5.0.1-01208-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50186 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
