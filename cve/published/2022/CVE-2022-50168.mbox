Subject: CVE-2022-50168: bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, x86: fix freeing of not-finalized bpf_prog_pack

syzbot reported a few issues with bpf_prog_pack [1], [2]. This only happens
with multiple subprogs. In jit_subprogs(), we first call bpf_int_jit_compile()
on each sub program. And then, we call it on each sub program again. jit_data
is not freed in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile(). Similarly we don't
call bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() in the first call of bpf_int_jit_compile().

If bpf_int_jit_compile() failed for one sub program, we will call
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() for this sub program. However, we don't have a
chance to call it for other sub programs. Then we will hit "goto out_free" in
jit_subprogs(), and call bpf_jit_free on some subprograms that haven't got
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() yet.

At this point, bpf_jit_binary_pack_free() is called and the whole 2MB page is
freed erroneously.

Fix this with a custom bpf_jit_free() for x86_64, which calls
bpf_jit_binary_pack_finalize() if necessary. Also, with custom
bpf_jit_free(), bpf_prog_aux->use_bpf_prog_pack is not needed any more,
remove it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
