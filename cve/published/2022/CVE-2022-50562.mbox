Subject: CVE-2022-50562: tpm: acpi: Call acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: acpi: Call acpi_put_table() to fix memory leak

The start and length of the event log area are obtained from
TPM2 or TCPA table, so we call acpi_get_table() to get the
ACPI information, but the acpi_get_table() should be coupled with
acpi_put_table() to release the ACPI memory, add the acpi_put_table()
properly to fix the memory leak.

While we are at it, remove the redundant empty line at the
end of the tpm_read_log_acpi().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50562 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
