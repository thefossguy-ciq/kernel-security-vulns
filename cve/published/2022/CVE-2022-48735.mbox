Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding

The LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers are
registered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the
HD-audio codec device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres
release doesn't work for this case; namely, since the codec resource
release happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULL
dereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.

For fixing the bug, this patch changes the LED class device register
and unregister in a manual manner without devres, keeping the
instances in hda_gen_spec.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48735 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/pci/hda/hda_generic.c
	sound/pci/hda/hda_generic.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
