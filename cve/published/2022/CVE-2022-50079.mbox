Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check correct bounds for stream encoder instances for DCN303

[Why & How]
eng_id for DCN303 cannot be more than 1, since we have only two
instances of stream encoders.

Check the correct boundary condition for engine ID for DCN303 prevent
the potential out of bounds access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50079 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
