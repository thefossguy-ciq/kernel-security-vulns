Subject: CVE-2022-50640: mmc: core: Fix kernel panic when remove non-standard SDIO card

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: core: Fix kernel panic when remove non-standard SDIO card

SDIO tuple is only allocated for standard SDIO card, especially it causes
memory corruption issues when the non-standard SDIO card has removed, which
is because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at
sdio_init_func(), but all SDIO card device reference counter gets decreased
at sdio_release_func().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50640 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
