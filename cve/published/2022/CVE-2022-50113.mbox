Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoc: audio-graph-card2: Fix refcount leak bug in __graph_get_type()

We should call of_node_put() for the reference before its replacement
as it returned by of_get_parent() which has increased the refcount.
Besides, we should also call of_node_put() before return.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50113 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
