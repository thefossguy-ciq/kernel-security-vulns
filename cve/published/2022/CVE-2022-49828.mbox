Subject: CVE-2022-49828: hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hugetlbfs: don't delete error page from pagecache

This change is very similar to the change that was made for shmem [1], and
it solves the same problem but for HugeTLBFS instead.

Currently, when poison is found in a HugeTLB page, the page is removed
from the page cache.  That means that attempting to map or read that
hugepage in the future will result in a new hugepage being allocated
instead of notifying the user that the page was poisoned.  As [1] states,
this is effectively memory corruption.

The fix is to leave the page in the page cache.  If the user attempts to
use a poisoned HugeTLB page with a syscall, the syscall will fail with
EIO, the same error code that shmem uses.  For attempts to map the page,
the thread will get a BUS_MCEERR_AR SIGBUS.

[1]: commit a76054266661 ("mm: shmem: don't truncate page if memory failure happens")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
