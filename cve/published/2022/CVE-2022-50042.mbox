Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: genl: fix error path memory leak in policy dumping

If construction of the array of policies fails when recording
non-first policy we need to unwind.

netlink_policy_dump_add_policy() itself also needs fixing as
it currently gives up on error without recording the allocated
pointer in the pstate pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50042 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
