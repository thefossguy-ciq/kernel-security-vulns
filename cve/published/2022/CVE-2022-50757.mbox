Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: camss: Clean up received buffers on failed start of streaming

It is required to return the received buffers, if streaming can not be
started. For instance media_pipeline_start() may fail with EPIPE, if
a link validation between entities is not passed, and in such a case
a user gets a kernel warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 520 at drivers/media/common/videobuf2/videobuf2-core.c:1592 vb2_start_streaming+0xec/0x160
  <snip>
  Call trace:
   vb2_start_streaming+0xec/0x160
   vb2_core_streamon+0x9c/0x1a0
   vb2_ioctl_streamon+0x68/0xbc
   v4l_streamon+0x30/0x3c
   __video_do_ioctl+0x184/0x3e0
   video_usercopy+0x37c/0x7b0
   video_ioctl2+0x24/0x40
   v4l2_ioctl+0x4c/0x70

The fix is to correct the error path in video_start_streaming() of camss.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50757 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
