Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: zynq-ipi: fix error handling while device_register() fails

If device_register() fails, it has two issues:
1. The name allocated by dev_set_name() is leaked.
2. The parent of device is not NULL, device_unregister() is called
   in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes(), it will lead a kernel crash because
   of removing not added device.

Call put_device() to give up the reference, so the name is freed in
kobject_cleanup(). Add device registered check in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes()
to avoid null-ptr-deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50672 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
