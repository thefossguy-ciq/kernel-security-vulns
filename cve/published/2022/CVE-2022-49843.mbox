Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Migrate in CPU page fault use current mm

migrate_vma_setup shows below warning because we don't hold another
process mm mmap_lock. We should use current vmf->vma->vm_mm instead, the
caller already hold current mmap lock inside CPU page fault handler.

 WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 3054 at include/linux/mmap_lock.h:155 find_vma

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
