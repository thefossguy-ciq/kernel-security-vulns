Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: possible module reference underflow in error path

dst->ops is set on when nft_expr_clone() fails, but module refcount has
not been bumped yet, therefore nft_expr_destroy() leads to module
reference underflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b59bee8b05b0e789b5a298cacb09e8aaa3367a29
