Subject: CVE-2022-49912: btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests

In the test_no_shared_qgroup() and test_multiple_refs() qgroup self tests,
if we fail to add the tree ref, remove the extent item or remove the
extent ref, we are returning from the test function without freeing the
"old_roots" ulist that was allocated by the previous calls to
btrfs_find_all_roots(). Fix that by calling ulist_free() before returning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49912 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
