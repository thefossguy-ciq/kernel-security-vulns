Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_hid: fix refcount leak on error path

When failing to allocate report_desc, opts->refcnt has already been
incremented so it needs to be decremented to avoid leaving the options
structure permanently locked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50514 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
