Subject: CVE-2022-50544: usb: host: xhci: Fix potential memory leak in xhci_alloc_stream_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: host: xhci: Fix potential memory leak in xhci_alloc_stream_info()

xhci_alloc_stream_info() allocates stream context array for stream_info
->stream_ctx_array with xhci_alloc_stream_ctx(). When some error occurs,
stream_info->stream_ctx_array is not released, which will lead to a
memory leak.

We can fix it by releasing the stream_info->stream_ctx_array with
xhci_free_stream_ctx() on the error path to avoid the potential memory
leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50544 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
