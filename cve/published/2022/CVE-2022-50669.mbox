Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: ocxl: fix possible name leak in ocxl_file_register_afu()

If device_register() returns error in ocxl_file_register_afu(),
the name allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed. As comment
of device_register() says, it should use put_device() to give
up the reference in the error path. So fix this by calling
put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup(),
and info is freed in info_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50669 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
