Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Fix possible leaked pernet namespace in smc_init()

In smc_init(), register_pernet_subsys(&smc_net_stat_ops) is called
without any error handling.
If it fails, registering of &smc_net_ops won't be reverted.
And if smc_nl_init() fails, &smc_net_stat_ops itself won't be reverted.

This leaves wild ops in subsystem linkedlist and when another module
tries to call register_pernet_operations() it triggers page fault:

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffbfff81b964c
RIP: 0010:register_pernet_operations+0x1b9/0x5f0
Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  register_pernet_subsys+0x29/0x40
  ebtables_init+0x58/0x1000 [ebtables]
  ...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49905 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
