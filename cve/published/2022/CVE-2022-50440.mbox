Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Validate the box size for the snooped cursor

Invalid userspace dma surface copies could potentially overflow
the memcpy from the surface to the snooped image leading to crashes.
To fix it the dimensions of the copybox have to be validated
against the expected size of the snooped cursor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50440 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
