Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wl1251: dynamically allocate memory used for DMA

With introduction of vmap'ed stacks, stack parameters can no
longer be used for DMA and now leads to kernel panic.

It happens at several places for the wl1251 (e.g. when
accessed through SDIO) making it unuseable on e.g. the
OpenPandora.

We solve this by allocating temporary buffers or use wl1251_read32().

Tested on v5.18-rc5 with OpenPandora.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49500 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
