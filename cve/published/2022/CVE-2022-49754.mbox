Subject: CVE-2022-49754: Bluetooth: Fix a buffer overflow in mgmt_mesh_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix a buffer overflow in mgmt_mesh_add()

Smatch Warning:
net/bluetooth/mgmt_util.c:375 mgmt_mesh_add() error: __memcpy()
'mesh_tx->param' too small (48 vs 50)

Analysis:

'mesh_tx->param' is array of size 48. This is the destination.
u8 param[sizeof(struct mgmt_cp_mesh_send) + 29]; // 19 + 29 = 48.

But in the caller 'mesh_send' we reject only when len > 50.
len > (MGMT_MESH_SEND_SIZE + 31) // 19 + 31 = 50.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49754 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
