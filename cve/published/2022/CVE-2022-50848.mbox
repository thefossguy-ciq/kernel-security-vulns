Subject: CVE-2022-50848: drivers: dio: fix possible memory leak in dio_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: dio: fix possible memory leak in dio_init()

If device_register() returns error, the 'dev' and name needs be
freed. Add a release function, and then call put_device() in the
error path, so the name is freed in kobject_cleanup() and to the
'dev' is freed in release function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
