Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: enforce documented limit to prevent allocating huge memory

Daniel Xu reported that the hash:net,iface type of the ipset subsystem does
not limit adding the same network with different interfaces to a set, which
can lead to huge memory usage or allocation failure.

The quick reproducer is

$ ipset create ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT hash:net,iface hashsize 1048576 timeout 0
$ for i in $(seq 0 100); do /sbin/ipset add ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT 0.0.0.0/0,kaf_$i timeout 0 -exist; done

The backtrace when vmalloc fails:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] ipset: vmalloc error: size 1073741848, exceeds total pages
        <...>
        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] Call Trace:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022]  ? hash_netiface4_resize+0x99/0x710
        <...>

The fix is to enforce the limit documented in the ipset(8) manpage:

>  The internal restriction of the hash:net,iface set type is that the same
>  network prefix cannot be stored with more than 64 different interfaces
>  in a single set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
