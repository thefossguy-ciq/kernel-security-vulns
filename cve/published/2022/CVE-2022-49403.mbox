Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/string_helpers: fix not adding strarray to device's resource list

Add allocated strarray to device's resource list. This is a must to
automatically release strarray when the device disappears.

Without this fix we have a memory leak in the few drivers which use
devm_kasprintf_strarray().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49403 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
