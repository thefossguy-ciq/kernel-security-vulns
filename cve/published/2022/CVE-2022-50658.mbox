Subject: CVE-2022-50658: cpufreq: qcom: fix memory leak in error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: qcom: fix memory leak in error path

If for some reason the speedbin length is incorrect, then there is a
memory leak in the error path because we never free the speedbin buffer.
This commit fixes the error path to always free the speedbin buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50658 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
