Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix memory leak in uvc_gpio_parse

Previously the unit buffer was allocated before checking the IRQ for
privacy GPIO. In case of error, the unit buffer was leaked.

Allocate the unit buffer after the IRQ to avoid it.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1474639 ("Resource leak")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50882 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
