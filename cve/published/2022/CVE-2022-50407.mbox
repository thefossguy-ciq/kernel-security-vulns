Subject: CVE-2022-50407: crypto: hisilicon/qm - increase the memory of local variables

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/qm - increase the memory of local variables

Increase the buffer to prevent stack overflow by fuzz test. The maximum
length of the qos configuration buffer is 256 bytes. Currently, the value
of the 'val buffer' is only 32 bytes. The sscanf does not check the dest
memory length. So the 'val buffer' may stack overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50407 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
