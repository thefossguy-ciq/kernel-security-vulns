Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/qm - increase the memory of local variables

Increase the buffer to prevent stack overflow by fuzz test. The maximum
length of the qos configuration buffer is 256 bytes. Currently, the value
of the 'val buffer' is only 32 bytes. The sscanf does not check the dest
memory length. So the 'val buffer' may stack overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50407 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.0.16 with commit 34c4f8ad45b4ea814c7ecc3f23a2d292959d5a52
	Fixed in 6.1.2 with commit fc521abb6ee4b8f06fdfc52646140dab6a2ed334
	Fixed in 6.2 with commit 3efe90af4c0c46c58dba1b306de142827153d9c0

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2022-50407
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/34c4f8ad45b4ea814c7ecc3f23a2d292959d5a52
