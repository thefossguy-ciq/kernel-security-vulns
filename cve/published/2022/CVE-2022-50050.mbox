Subject: CVE-2022-50050: ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Fix potential buffer overflow by snprintf()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Fix potential buffer overflow by snprintf()

snprintf() returns the would-be-filled size when the string overflows
the given buffer size, hence using this value may result in the buffer
overflow (although it's unrealistic).

This patch replaces with a safer version, scnprintf() for papering
over such a potential issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ee1310f4d148dbf04c4159b88afd0b941018903
