Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix sleep from invalid context bug in btrfs_qgroup_inherit()

Syzkaller reported BUG as follows:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at
       include/linux/sched/mm.h:274
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>

   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x193/0x200

Fix this by calling qgroup_dirty() on @dstqgroup, and update limit item in
btrfs_run_qgroups() later outside of the spinlock context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49033 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
