Subject: CVE-2022-50581: hfs: fix OOB Read in __hfs_brec_find

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfs: fix OOB Read in __hfs_brec_find

Syzbot reported a OOB read bug:

==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_strcmp+0x117/0x190
fs/hfs/string.c:84

 write_inode fs/fs-writeback.c:1440 [inline]

If the input inode of hfs_write_inode() is incorrect:
struct inode
  struct hfs_inode_info
    struct hfs_cat_key
      struct hfs_name
        u8 len # len is greater than HFS_NAMELEN(31) which is the
maximum length of an HFS filename

OOB read occurred:
hfs_write_inode()
  hfs_brec_find()
    __hfs_brec_find()
      hfs_cat_keycmp()
        hfs_strcmp() # OOB read occurred due to len is too large

Fix this by adding a Check on len in hfs_write_inode() before calling
hfs_brec_find().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50581 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
