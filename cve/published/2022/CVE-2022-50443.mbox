Subject: CVE-2022-50443: drm/rockchip: lvds: fix PM usage counter unbalance in poweron

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/rockchip: lvds: fix PM usage counter unbalance in poweron

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it failed.
Forgetting to putting operation will result in reference leak here.
We fix it by replacing it with the newest pm_runtime_resume_and_get
to keep usage counter balanced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50443 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
