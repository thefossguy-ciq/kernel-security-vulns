Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipc: mqueue: fix possible memory leak in init_mqueue_fs()

commit db7cfc380900 ("ipc: Free mq_sysctls if ipc namespace creation
failed")

Here's a similar memory leak to the one fixed by the patch above.
retire_mq_sysctls need to be called when init_mqueue_fs fails after
setup_mq_sysctls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
