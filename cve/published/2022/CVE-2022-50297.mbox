Subject: CVE-2022-50297: wifi: ath9k: verify the expected usb_endpoints are present

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: verify the expected usb_endpoints are present

The bug arises when a USB device claims to be an ATH9K but doesn't
have the expected endpoints. (In this case there was an interrupt
endpoint where the driver expected a bulk endpoint.) The kernel
needs to be able to handle such devices without getting an internal error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
