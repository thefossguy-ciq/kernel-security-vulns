Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix duplicated reported IW_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REPLY event

If siw_recv_mpa_rr returns -EAGAIN, it means that the MPA reply hasn't
been received completely, and should not report IW_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REPLY
in this case. This may trigger a call trace in iw_cm. A simple way to
trigger this:
 server: ib_send_lat
 client: ib_send_lat -R <server_ip>

The call trace looks like this:

 kernel BUG at drivers/infiniband/core/iwcm.c:894!
 invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI
 <...>
 Workqueue: iw_cm_wq cm_work_handler [iw_cm]
 Call Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
