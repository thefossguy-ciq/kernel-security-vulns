Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc

Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to
soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
similar issue).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50105 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit 15c7fab0e047 and fixed in 6.11.6 with commit 176a41ebec42
	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit 15c7fab0e047 and fixed in 6.12-rc5 with commit db7e59e6a39a

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-50105
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/soc/qcom/Kconfig
	sound/soc/qcom/sc7280.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/176a41ebec42a921277cd34e8c0c2e776a9dd6c4
