Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: cevt-r4k: Don't call get_c0_compare_int if timer irq is installed

This avoids warning:

[    0.118053] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:283

Caused by get_c0_compare_int on secondary CPU.

We also skipped saving IRQ number to struct clock_event_device *cd as
it's never used by clockevent core, as per comments it's only meant
for "non CPU local devices".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46832 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
