Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: disallow setting special AP channel widths

Setting the AP channel width is meant for use with the normal
20/40/... MHz channel width progression, and switching around
in S1G or narrow channels isn't supported. Disallow that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43912 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.105 with commit 3d42f2125f6c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
