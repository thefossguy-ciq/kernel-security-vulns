Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-verity: restart or panic on an I/O error

Maxim Suhanov reported that dm-verity doesn't crash if an I/O error
happens. In theory, this could be used to subvert security, because an
attacker can create sectors that return error with the Write Uncorrectable
command. Some programs may misbehave if they have to deal with EIO.

This commit fixes dm-verity, so that if "panic_on_corruption" or
"restart_on_corruption" was specified and an I/O error happens, the
machine will panic or restart.

This commit also changes kernel_restart to emergency_restart -
kernel_restart calls reboot notifiers and these reboot notifiers may wait
for the bio that failed. emergency_restart doesn't call the notifiers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47725 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
