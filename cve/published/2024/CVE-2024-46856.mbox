Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: dp83822: Fix NULL pointer dereference on DP83825 devices

The probe() function is only used for DP83822 and DP83826 PHY,
leaving the private data pointer uninitialized for the DP83825 models
which causes a NULL pointer dereference in the recently introduced/changed
functions dp8382x_config_init() and dp83822_set_wol().

Add the dp8382x_probe() function, so all PHY models will have a valid
private data pointer to fix this issue and also prevent similar issues
in the future.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46856 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.10 with commit 9ef9ecfa9e9f and fixed in 6.10.11 with commit 67b61e2f4c9c

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/phy/dp83822.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67b61e2f4c9c5df97a9a2ef7a1fe35eae00531f4
