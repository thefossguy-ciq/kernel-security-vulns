Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: reject QUEUE/DROP verdict parameters

This reverts commit e0abdadcc6e1.

core.c:nf_hook_slow assumes that the upper 16 bits of NF_DROP
verdicts contain a valid errno, i.e. -EPERM, -EHOSTUNREACH or similar,
or 0.

Due to the reverted commit, its possible to provide a positive
value, e.g. NF_ACCEPT (1), which results in use-after-free.

Its not clear to me why this commit was made.

NF_QUEUE is not used by nftables; "queue" rules in nftables
will result in use of "nft_queue" expression.

If we later need to allow specifiying errno values from userspace
(do not know why), this has to call NF_DROP_GETERR and check that
"err <= 0" holds true.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26609 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
