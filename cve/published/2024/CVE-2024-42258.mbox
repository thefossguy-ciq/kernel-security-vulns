Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: huge_memory: use !CONFIG_64BIT to relax huge page alignment on 32 bit machines

Yves-Alexis Perez reported commit 4ef9ad19e176 ("mm: huge_memory: don't
force huge page alignment on 32 bit") didn't work for x86_32 [1].  It is
because x86_32 uses CONFIG_X86_32 instead of CONFIG_32BIT.

!CONFIG_64BIT should cover all 32 bit machines.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
