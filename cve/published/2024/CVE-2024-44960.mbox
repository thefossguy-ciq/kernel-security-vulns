Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: core: Check for unset descriptor

Make sure the descriptor has been set before looking at maxpacket.
This fixes a null pointer panic in this case.

This may happen if the gadget doesn't properly set up the endpoint
for the current speed, or the gadget descriptors are malformed and
the descriptor for the speed/endpoint are not found.

No current gadget driver is known to have this problem, but this
may cause a hard-to-find bug during development of new gadgets.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44960 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
