Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/igen6: Avoid segmentation fault on module unload

The segmentation fault happens because:

During modprobe:
1. In igen6_probe(), igen6_pvt will be allocated with kzalloc()
2. In igen6_register_mci(), mci->pvt_info will point to
   &igen6_pvt->imc[mc]

During rmmod:
1. In mci_release() in edac_mc.c, it will kfree(mci->pvt_info)
2. In igen6_remove(), it will kfree(igen6_pvt);

Fix this issue by setting mci->pvt_info to NULL to avoid the double
kfree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
