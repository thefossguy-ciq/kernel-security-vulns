Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/client: avoid possible NULL dereference in cifs_free_subrequest()

Clang static checker (scan-build) warning:
	cifsglob.h:line 890, column 3
	Access to field 'ops' results in a dereference of a null pointer.

Commit 519be989717c ("cifs: Add a tracepoint to track credits involved in
R/W requests") adds a check for 'rdata->server', and let clang throw this
warning about NULL dereference.

When 'rdata->credits.value != 0 && rdata->server == NULL' happens,
add_credits_and_wake_if() will call rdata->server->ops->add_credits().
This will cause NULL dereference problem. Add a check for 'rdata->server'
to avoid NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44992 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
