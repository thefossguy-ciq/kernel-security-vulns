Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix error path in multi-packet WQE transmit

Remove the erroneous unmap in case no DMA mapping was established

The multi-packet WQE transmit code attempts to obtain a DMA mapping for
the skb. This could fail, e.g. under memory pressure, when the IOMMU
driver just can't allocate more memory for page tables. While the code
tries to handle this in the path below the err_unmap label it erroneously
unmaps one entry from the sq's FIFO list of active mappings. Since the
current map attempt failed this unmap is removing some random DMA mapping
that might still be required. If the PCI function now presents that IOVA,
the IOMMU may assumes a rogue DMA access and e.g. on s390 puts the PCI
function in error state.

The erroneous behavior was seen in a stress-test environment that created
memory pressure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
