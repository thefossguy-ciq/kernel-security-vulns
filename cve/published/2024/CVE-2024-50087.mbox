Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free on read_alloc_one_name() error

The function read_alloc_one_name() does not initialize the name field of
the passed fscrypt_str struct if kmalloc fails to allocate the
corresponding buffer.  Thus, it is not guaranteed that
fscrypt_str.name is initialized when freeing it.

This is a follow-up to the linked patch that fixes the remaining
instances of the bug introduced by commit e43eec81c516 ("btrfs: use
struct qstr instead of name and namelen pairs").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
