Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix double free in error path

If the uvc_status_init() function fails to allocate the int_urb, it will
free the dev->status pointer but doesn't reset the pointer to NULL. This
results in the kfree() call in uvc_status_cleanup() trying to
double-free the memory. Fix it by resetting the dev->status pointer to
NULL after freeing it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
