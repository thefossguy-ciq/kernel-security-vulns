Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm vdo: don't refer to dedupe_context after releasing it

Clear the dedupe_context pointer in a data_vio whenever ownership of
the context is lost, so that vdo can't examine it accidentally.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50091 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.11.4 with commit 63ef073084c6
	Fixed in 6.12-rc1 with commit 0808ebf2f80b

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-50091
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/md/dm-vdo/dedupe.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63ef073084c67878d7a92e15ad055172da3f05a3
