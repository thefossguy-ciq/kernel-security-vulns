Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/gem: prevent integer overflow in msm_ioctl_gem_submit()

The "submit->cmd[i].size" and "submit->cmd[i].offset" variables are u32
values that come from the user via the submit_lookup_cmds() function.
This addition could lead to an integer wrapping bug so use size_add()
to prevent that.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/624696/

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-52559 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f1845e46c41ed500789d53dc45b383b7745c96c
