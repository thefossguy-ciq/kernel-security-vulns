Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: dummy: iio_simply_dummy_buffer: fix information leak in triggered buffer

The 'data' array is allocated via kmalloc() and it is used to push data
to user space from a triggered buffer, but it does not set values for
inactive channels, as it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel()
to assign new values.

Use kzalloc for the memory allocation to avoid pushing uninitialized
information to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
