Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: axp20x: AXP717: set ramp_delay

AXP717 datasheet says that regulator ramp delay is 15.625 us/step,
which is 10mV in our case.

Add a AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC_RANGES macro to
expand to AXP_DESC_RANGES_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0

For DCDC4, steps is 100mv

Add a AXP_DESC_DELAY macro and update AXP_DESC macro to
expand to AXP_DESC_DELAY with ramp_delay = 0

This patch fix crashes when using CPU DVFS.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53682 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10eb845a87193ef922cd002e0ff4f4759c1e918d
