Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix out-of-bounds access of directory entries

In the case of the directory size is greater than or equal to
the cluster size, if start_clu becomes an EOF cluster(an invalid
cluster) due to file system corruption, then the directory entry
where ei->hint_femp.eidx hint is outside the directory, resulting
in an out-of-bounds access, which may cause further file system
corruption.

This commit adds a check for start_clu, if it is an invalid cluster,
the file or directory will be treated as empty.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
