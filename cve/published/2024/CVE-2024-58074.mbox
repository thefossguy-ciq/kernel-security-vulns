Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Grab intel_display from the encoder to avoid potential oopsies

Grab the intel_display from 'encoder' rather than 'state'
in the encoder hooks to avoid the massive footgun that is
intel_sanitize_encoder(), which passes NULL as the 'state'
argument to encoder .disable() and .post_disable().

TODO: figure out how to actually fix intel_sanitize_encoder()...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58074 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_crt.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_tv.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1885401569f24eb35c631bcc4e6543360dbe9292
