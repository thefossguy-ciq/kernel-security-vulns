Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: MT - limit max slots

syzbot is reporting too large allocation at input_mt_init_slots(), for
num_slots is supplied from userspace using ioctl(UI_DEV_CREATE).

Since nobody knows possible max slots, this patch chose 1024.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45008 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
