Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: send: handle path ref underflow in header iterate_inode_ref()

Change BUG_ON to proper error handling if building the path buffer
fails. The pointers are not printed so we don't accidentally leak kernel
addresses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35935 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
