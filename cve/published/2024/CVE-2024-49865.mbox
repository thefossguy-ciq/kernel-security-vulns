Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/vm: move xa_alloc to prevent UAF

Evil user can guess the next id of the vm before the ioctl completes and
then call vm destroy ioctl to trigger UAF since create ioctl is still
referencing the same vm. Move the xa_alloc all the way to the end to
prevent this.

v2:
 - Rebase

(cherry picked from commit dcfd3971327f3ee92765154baebbaece833d3ca9)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49865 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/09cf8901fc0225898311b375cfcc67bae37ed5da
