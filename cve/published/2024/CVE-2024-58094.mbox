Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: add check read-only before truncation in jfs_truncate_nolock()

Added a check for "read-only" mode in the `jfs_truncate_nolock`
function to avoid errors related to writing to a read-only
filesystem.

Call stack:

block_write_begin() {
  jfs_write_failed() {
    jfs_truncate() {
      jfs_truncate_nolock() {
        txEnd() {
          ...
          log = JFS_SBI(tblk->sb)->log;
          // (log == NULL)

If the `isReadOnly(ip)` condition is triggered in
`jfs_truncate_nolock`, the function execution will stop, and no
further data modification will occur. Instead, the `xtTruncate`
function will be called with the "COMMIT_WMAP" flag, preventing
modifications in "read-only" mode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58094 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/jfs/inode.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f605bc3e162f5c6faa9bd3602ce496053d06a4bb
