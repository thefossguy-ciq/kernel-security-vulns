Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount

Syzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super

The del_timer_sync function cancels the s_err_report timer,
which reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should
guarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).

When filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3,
where an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing
a read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function
that ultimately re-arms the timer,
leaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.

Fix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49960 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
