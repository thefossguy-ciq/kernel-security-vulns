Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Restrict high priorities on group_create

We were allowing any users to create a high priority group without any
permission checks. As a result, this was allowing possible denial of
service.

We now only allow the DRM master or users with the CAP_SYS_NICE
capability to set higher priorities than PANTHOR_GROUP_PRIORITY_MEDIUM.

As the sole user of that uAPI lives in Mesa and hardcode a value of
MEDIUM [1], this should be safe to do.

Additionally, as those checks are performed at the ioctl level,
panthor_group_create now only check for priority level validity.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/panthor/panthor_drv.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/panthor/panthor_sched.c
	include/uapi/drm/panthor_drm.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
