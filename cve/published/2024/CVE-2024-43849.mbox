Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pdr: protect locator_addr with the main mutex

If the service locator server is restarted fast enough, the PDR can
rewrite locator_addr fields concurrently. Protect them by placing
modification of those fields under the main pdr->lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
