 </TASK>

When 'ioctl(OCFS2_IOC_GROUP_ADD, ...)' has failed for the particular
inode in 'ocfs2_verify_group_and_input()', corresponding buffer head
remains cached and subsequent call to the same 'ioctl()' for the same
inode issues the BUG() in 'ocfs2_set_new_buffer_uptodate()' (trying
to cache the same buffer head of that inode). Fix this by uncaching
the buffer head with 'ocfs2_remove_from_cache()' on error path in
'ocfs2_group_add()'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
