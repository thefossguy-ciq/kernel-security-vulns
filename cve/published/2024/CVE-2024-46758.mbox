Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (lm95234) Fix underflows seen when writing limit attributes

DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() after kstrtol() results in an underflow if a large
negative number such as -9223372036854775808 is provided by the user.
Fix it by reordering clamp_val() and DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46758 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
