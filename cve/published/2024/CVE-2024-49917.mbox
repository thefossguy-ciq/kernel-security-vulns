Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add NULL check for clk_mgr and clk_mgr->funcs in dcn30_init_hw

This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the
`dcn30_init_hw` function. The issue could occur when `dc->clk_mgr` or
`dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is null.

The fix adds a check to ensure `dc->clk_mgr` and `dc->clk_mgr->funcs` is
not null before accessing its functions. This prevents a potential null
pointer dereference.

Reported by smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:789 dcn30_init_hw() error: we previously assumed 'dc->clk_mgr' could be null (see line 628)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5443c83eb8fd2f88c71ced38848fbf744d6206a2
