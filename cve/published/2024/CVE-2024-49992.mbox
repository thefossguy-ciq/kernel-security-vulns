Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/stm: Avoid use-after-free issues with crtc and plane

ltdc_load() calls functions drm_crtc_init_with_planes(),
drm_universal_plane_init() and drm_encoder_init(). These functions
should not be called with parameters allocated with devm_kzalloc()
to avoid use-after-free issues [1].

Use allocations managed by the DRM framework.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
