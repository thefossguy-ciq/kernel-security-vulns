Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nommu: pass NULL argument to vma_iter_prealloc()

When deleting a vma entry from a maple tree, it has to pass NULL to
vma_iter_prealloc() in order to calculate internal state of the tree, but
it passed a wrong argument.  As a result, nommu kernels crashed upon
accessing a vma iterator, such as acct_collect() reading the size of vma
entries after do_munmap().

This commit fixes this issue by passing a right argument to the
preallocation call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53109 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
