Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Dereference null return value

In the function pqm_uninit there is a call-assignment of "pdd =
kfd_get_process_device_data" which could be null, and this value was
later dereferenced without checking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56666 to this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_process_queue_manager.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/768442d918932c4da09003f1fd6be1750b93a4ba
