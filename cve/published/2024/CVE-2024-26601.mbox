Subject: CVE-2024-26601: ext4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay

This mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd ("ext4: remove redundant
mb_regenerate_buddy()") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based on
code in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as free
blocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the
buddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26601 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
