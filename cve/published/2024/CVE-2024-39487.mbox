Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: Fix out-of-bounds read in bond_option_arp_ip_targets_set()

In function bond_option_arp_ip_targets_set(), if newval->string is an
empty string, newval->string+1 will point to the byte after the
string, causing an out-of-bound read.

Fix it by adding a check of string length before using it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
