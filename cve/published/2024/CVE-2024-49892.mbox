Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Initialize get_bytes_per_element's default to 1

Variables, used as denominators and maybe not assigned to other values,
should not be 0. bytes_per_element_y & bytes_per_element_c are
initialized by get_bytes_per_element() which should never return 0.

This fixes 10 DIVIDE_BY_ZERO issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49892 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
