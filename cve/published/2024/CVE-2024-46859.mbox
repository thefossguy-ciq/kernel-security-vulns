Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: panasonic-laptop: Fix SINF array out of bounds accesses

The panasonic laptop code in various places uses the SINF array with index
values of 0 - SINF_CUR_BRIGHT(0x0d) without checking that the SINF array
is big enough.

Not all panasonic laptops have this many SINF array entries, for example
the Toughbook CF-18 model only has 10 SINF array entries. So it only
supports the AC+DC brightness entries and mute.

Check that the SINF array has a minimum size which covers all AC+DC
brightness entries and refuse to load if the SINF array is smaller.

For higher SINF indexes hide the sysfs attributes when the SINF array
does not contain an entry for that attribute, avoiding show()/store()
accessing the array out of bounds and add bounds checking to the probe()
and resume() code accessing these.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
