Subject: CVE-2024-58097: wifi: ath11k: fix RCU stall while reaping monitor destination ring

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix RCU stall while reaping monitor destination ring

While processing the monitor destination ring, MSDUs are reaped from the
link descriptor based on the corresponding buf_id.

However, sometimes the driver cannot obtain a valid buffer corresponding
to the buf_id received from the hardware. This causes an infinite loop
in the destination processing, resulting in a kernel crash.

kernel log:
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data msdu_pop: invalid buf_id 309
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data msdu_pop: invalid buf_id 309
ath11k_pci 0000:58:00.0: data dp_rx_monitor_link_desc_return failed

Fix this by skipping the problematic buf_id and reaping the next entry,
replacing the break with the next MSDU processing.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
