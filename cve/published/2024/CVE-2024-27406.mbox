Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/Kconfig.debug: TEST_IOV_ITER depends on MMU

Trying to run the iov_iter unit test on a nommu system such as the qemu
kc705-nommu emulation results in a crash.

    KTAP version 1
    # Subtest: iov_iter
    # module: kunit_iov_iter
    1..9
BUG: failure at mm/nommu.c:318/vmap()!
Kernel panic - not syncing: BUG!

The test calls vmap() directly, but vmap() is not supported on nommu
systems, causing the crash.  TEST_IOV_ITER therefore needs to depend on
MMU.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27406 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
