Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: Don't overflow subsysnqn

nvmet_root_discovery_nqn_store treats the subsysnqn string like a fixed
size buffer, even though it is dynamically allocated to the size of the
string.

Create a new string with kstrndup instead of using the old buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53681 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86645d8d062af3fdcbdaa0a289b95de55bca827d
