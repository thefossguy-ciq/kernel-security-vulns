Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wilc1000: fix potential RCU dereference issue in wilc_parse_join_bss_param

In the `wilc_parse_join_bss_param` function, the TSF field of the `ies`
structure is accessed after the RCU read-side critical section is
unlocked. According to RCU usage rules, this is illegal. Reusing this
pointer can lead to unpredictable behavior, including accessing memory
that has been updated or causing use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the TSF value is now stored in a local variable
`ies_tsf` before the RCU lock is released. The `param->tsf_lo` field is
then assigned using this local variable, ensuring that the TSF value is
safely accessed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47712 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
