Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/arm/malidp: fix a possible null pointer dereference

In malidp_mw_connector_reset, new memory is allocated with kzalloc, but
no check is performed. In order to prevent null pointer dereferencing,
ensure that mw_state is checked before calling
__drm_atomic_helper_connector_reset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36014 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 4.19 with commit 8cbc5caf36ef and fixed in 6.10-rc1 with commit a1f95aede628

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-36014
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/arm/malidp_mw.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
