Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: scm: Mark get_wq_ctx() as atomic call

Currently get_wq_ctx() is wrongly configured as a standard call. When two
SMC calls are in sleep and one SMC wakes up, it calls get_wq_ctx() to
resume the corresponding sleeping thread. But if get_wq_ctx() is
interrupted, goes to sleep and another SMC call is waiting to be allocated
a waitq context, it leads to a deadlock.

To avoid this get_wq_ctx() must be an atomic call and can't be a standard
SMC call. Hence mark get_wq_ctx() as a fast call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46692 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdf7efe4b02aa93813db0bf1ca596ad298ab6b06
