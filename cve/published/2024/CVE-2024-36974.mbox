Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: taprio: always validate TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_PRIOMAP

If one TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_PRIOMAP attribute has been provided,
taprio_parse_mqprio_opt() must validate it, or userspace
can inject arbitrary data to the kernel, the second time
taprio_change() is called.

First call (with valid attributes) sets dev->num_tc
to a non zero value.

Second call (with arbitrary mqprio attributes)
returns early from taprio_parse_mqprio_opt()
and bad things can happen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36974 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.2 with commit a3d43c0d56f1 and fixed in 6.10-rc3 with commit f921a58ae208

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-36974
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/sched/sch_taprio.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
