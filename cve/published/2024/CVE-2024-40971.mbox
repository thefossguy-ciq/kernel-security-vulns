Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: remove clear SB_INLINECRYPT flag in default_options

In f2fs_remount, SB_INLINECRYPT flag will be clear and re-set.
If create new file or open file during this gap, these files
will not use inlinecrypt. Worse case, it may lead to data
corruption if wrappedkey_v0 is enable.

Thread A:                               Thread B:

-f2fs_remount				-f2fs_file_open or f2fs_new_inode
  -default_options
	<- clear SB_INLINECRYPT flag

                                          -fscrypt_select_encryption_impl

  -parse_options
	<- set SB_INLINECRYPT again

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40971 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
