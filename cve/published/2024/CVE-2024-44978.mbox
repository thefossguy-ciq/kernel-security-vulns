Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Free job before xe_exec_queue_put

Free job depends on job->vm being valid, the last xe_exec_queue_put can
destroy the VM. Prevent UAF by freeing job before xe_exec_queue_put.

(cherry picked from commit 32a42c93b74c8ca6d0915ea3eba21bceff53042f)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/98aa0330f200b9b8fb9e1298e006eda57a13351c
