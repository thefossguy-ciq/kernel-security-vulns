Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: pass cred pointer to ceph_mds_auth_match()

This eliminates a redundant get_current_cred() call, because
ceph_mds_check_access() has already obtained this pointer.

As a side effect, this also fixes a reference leak in
ceph_mds_auth_match(): by omitting the get_current_cred() call, no
additional cred reference is taken.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56564 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ffa6ba7bdb7f07f49c9e9150b0176df066520f62
