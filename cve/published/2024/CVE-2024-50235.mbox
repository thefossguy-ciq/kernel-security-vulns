Subject: CVE-2024-50235: wifi: cfg80211: clear wdev->cqm_config pointer on free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: clear wdev->cqm_config pointer on free

When we free wdev->cqm_config when unregistering, we also
need to clear out the pointer since the same wdev/netdev
may get re-registered in another network namespace, then
destroyed later, running this code again, which results in
a double-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50235 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
