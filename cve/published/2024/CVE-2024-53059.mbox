Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix response handling in iwl_mvm_send_recovery_cmd()

1. The size of the response packet is not validated.
2. The response buffer is not freed.

Resolve these issues by switching to iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status(),
which handles both size validation and frees the buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53059 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
