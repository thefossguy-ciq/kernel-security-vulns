Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: flush all requests after setting CACHEFILES_DEAD

In ondemand mode, when the daemon is processing an open request, if the
kernel flags the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, the cachefiles_daemon_write()
will always return -EIO, so the daemon can't pass the copen to the kernel.
Then the kernel process that is waiting for the copen triggers a hung_task.

Since the DEAD state is irreversible, it can only be exited by closing
/dev/cachefiles. Therefore, after calling cachefiles_io_error() to mark
the cache as CACHEFILES_DEAD, if in ondemand mode, flush all requests to
avoid the above hungtask. We may still be able to read some of the cached
data before closing the fd of /dev/cachefiles.

Note that this relies on the patch that adds reference counting to the req,
otherwise it may UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40935 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/cachefiles/daemon.c
	fs/cachefiles/internal.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
