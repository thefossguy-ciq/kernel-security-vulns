Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix memfd_pin_folios free_huge_pages leak

memfd_pin_folios followed by unpin_folios fails to restore free_huge_pages
if the pages were not already faulted in, because the folio refcount for
pages created by memfd_alloc_folio never goes to 0.  memfd_pin_folios
needs another folio_put to undo the folio_try_get below:

memfd_alloc_folio()
  alloc_hugetlb_folio_nodemask()
    dequeue_hugetlb_folio_nodemask()
      dequeue_hugetlb_folio_node_exact()
        folio_ref_unfreeze(folio, 1);    ; adds 1 refcount
  folio_try_get()                        ; adds 1 refcount
  hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()            ; adds 512 refcount (on x86)

With the fix, after memfd_pin_folios + unpin_folios, the refcount for the
(unfaulted) page is 512, which is correct, as the refcount for a faulted
unpinned page is 513.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49964 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
