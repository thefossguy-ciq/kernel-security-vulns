Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: amphion: Set video drvdata before register video device

The video drvdata should be set before the video device is registered,
otherwise video_drvdata() may return NULL in the open() file ops, and led
to oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56579 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
