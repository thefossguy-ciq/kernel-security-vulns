Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Add a per-VF limit on number of FDIR filters

While the iavf driver adds a s/w limit (128) on the number of FDIR
filters that the VF can request, a malicious VF driver can request more
than that and exhaust the resources for other VFs.

Add a similar limit in ice.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42291 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
