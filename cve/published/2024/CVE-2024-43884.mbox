Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: MGMT: Add error handling to pair_device()

pointer dereference causing a crash.

Fixed by adding error handling in the function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43884 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 4.3 with commit 5157b8a503fa and fixed in 6.11-rc5 with commit 538fd3921afa

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
