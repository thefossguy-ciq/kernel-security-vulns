Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb-storage: alauda: Check whether the media is initialized

The member "uzonesize" of struct alauda_info will remain 0
if alauda_init_media() fails, potentially causing divide errors
in alauda_read_data() and alauda_write_lba().
- Add a member "media_initialized" to struct alauda_info.
- Change a condition in alauda_check_media() to ensure the
  first initialization.
- Add an error check for the return value of alauda_init_media().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38619 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
