Subject: CVE-2024-26822: smb: client: set correct id, uid and cruid for multiuser automounts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: set correct id, uid and cruid for multiuser automounts

When uid, gid and cruid are not specified, we need to dynamically
set them into the filesystem context used for automounting otherwise
they'll end up reusing the values from the parent mount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
