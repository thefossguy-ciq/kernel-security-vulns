Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: imx93-blk-ctrl: correct remove path

The check condition should be 'i < bc->onecell_data.num_domains', not
'bc->onecell_data.num_domains' which will make the look never finish
and cause kernel panic.

Also disable runtime to address
"imx93-blk-ctrl 4ac10000.system-controller: Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!"

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
