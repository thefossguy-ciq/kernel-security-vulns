Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

the nvme_unmap_data() should have same condition to avoid dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
