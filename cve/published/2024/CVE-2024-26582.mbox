Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt

tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb,
so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger
a use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the
partially-read skb.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26582 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.0 with commit fd31f3996af2 and fixed in 6.8-rc5 with commit 32b55c5ff910

Please see https://www.kernel.org or a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-26582
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/tls/tls_sw.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
