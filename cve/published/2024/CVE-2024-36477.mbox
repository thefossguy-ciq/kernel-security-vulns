Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer

The TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the
maximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, it
does not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data
frame. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with
KASAN.

Introduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the
transfer buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36477 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis_spi_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1547183852dcdfcc25878db7dd3620509217b0cd
