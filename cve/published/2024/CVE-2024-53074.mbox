Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't leak a link on AP removal

Release the link mapping resource in AP removal. This impacted devices
that do not support the MLD API (9260 and down).
On those devices, we couldn't start the AP again after the AP has been
already started and stopped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53074 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/70ddf9ce1894c48dbbf10b0de51a95e4fb3dd376
