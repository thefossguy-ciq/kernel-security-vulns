Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Take return from set_memory_rox() into account with bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro()

set_memory_rox() can fail, leaving memory unprotected.

Check return and bail out when bpf_jit_binary_lock_ro() returns
an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42067 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
