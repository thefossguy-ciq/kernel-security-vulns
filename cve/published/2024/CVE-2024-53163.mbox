Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat/qat_420xx - fix off by one in uof_get_name()

This is called from uof_get_name_420xx() where "num_objs" is the
ARRAY_SIZE() of fw_objs[].  The > needs to be >= to prevent an out of
bounds access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53163 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
