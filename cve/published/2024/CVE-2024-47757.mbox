Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential oob read in nilfs_btree_check_delete()

The function nilfs_btree_check_delete(), which checks whether degeneration
to direct mapping occurs before deleting a b-tree entry, causes memory
access outside the block buffer when retrieving the maximum key if the
root node has no entries.

This does not usually happen because b-tree mappings with 0 child nodes
are never created by mkfs.nilfs2 or nilfs2 itself.  However, it can happen
if the b-tree root node read from a device is configured that way, so fix
this potential issue by adding a check for that case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47757 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
