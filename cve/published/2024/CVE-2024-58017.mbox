Subject: CVE-2024-58017: printk: Fix signed integer overflow when defining LOG_BUF_LEN_MAX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

printk: Fix signed integer overflow when defining LOG_BUF_LEN_MAX

Shifting 1 << 31 on a 32-bit int causes signed integer overflow, which
leads to undefined behavior. To prevent this, cast 1 to u32 before
performing the shift, ensuring well-defined behavior.

This change explicitly avoids any potential overflow by ensuring that
the shift occurs on an unsigned 32-bit integer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
