Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppdev: Add an error check in register_device

In register_device, the return value of ida_simple_get is unchecked,
in witch ida_simple_get will use an invalid index value.

To address this issue, index should be checked after ida_simple_get. When
the index value is abnormal, a warning message should be printed, the port
should be dropped, and the value should be recorded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
