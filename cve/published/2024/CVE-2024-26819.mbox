Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: limit the number of targets and parameter size area

The kvmalloc function fails with a warning if the size is larger than
INT_MAX. The warning was triggered by a syscall testing robot.

In order to avoid the warning, this commit limits the number of targets to
1048576 and the size of the parameter area to 1073741824.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
