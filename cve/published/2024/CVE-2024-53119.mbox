Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio/vsock: Fix accept_queue memory leak

As the final stages of socket destruction may be delayed, it is possible
that virtio_transport_recv_listen() will be called after the accept_queue
has been flushed, but before the SOCK_DONE flag has been set. As a result,
sockets enqueued after the flush would remain unremoved, leading to a
memory leak.

  release

Introduce a sk_shutdown check to disallow vsock_enqueue_accept() during
socket destruction.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
