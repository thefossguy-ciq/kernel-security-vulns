Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: Fix a memory leak in nf_tables_updchain

If nft_netdev_register_hooks() fails, the memory associated with
nft_stats is not freed, causing a memory leak.

This patch fixes it by moving nft_stats_alloc() down after
nft_netdev_register_hooks() succeeds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27064 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
