Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: kvm: Fix out-of-bounds array access

In kvm_riscv_vcpu_sbi_init() the entry->ext_idx can contain an
out-of-bound index. This is used as a special marker for the base
extensions, that cannot be disabled. However, when traversing the
extensions, that special marker is not checked prior indexing the
array.

Add an out-of-bounds check to the function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
