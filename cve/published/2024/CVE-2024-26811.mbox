Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: validate payload size in ipc response

If installing malicious ksmbd-tools, ksmbd.mountd can return invalid ipc
response to ksmbd kernel server. ksmbd should validate payload size of
ipc response from ksmbd.mountd to avoid memory overrun or
slab-out-of-bounds. This patch validate 3 ipc response that has payload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26811 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.9-rc3 with commit a677ebd8ca2f

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-26811
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

	fs/smb/server/mgmt/share_config.c
	fs/smb/server/transport_ipc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
