Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/iwcm: Fix WARNING:at_kernel/workqueue.c:#check_flush_dependency

In the commit aee2424246f9 ("RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to
destroying CM IDs"), the function flush_workqueue is invoked to flush the
work queue iwcm_wq.

But at that time, the work queue iwcm_wq was created via the function
alloc_ordered_workqueue without the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM.

Because the current process is trying to flush the whole iwcm_wq, if
iwcm_wq doesn't have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, verify that the current
process is not reclaiming memory or running on a workqueue which doesn't
have the flag WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as that can break forward-progress guarantee
leading to a deadlock.

The call trace is as below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
