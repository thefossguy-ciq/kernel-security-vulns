Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vc4: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed

Upon closing the file descriptor, the active performance monitor is not
stopped. Although all perfmons are destroyed in `vc4_perfmon_close_file()`,
the active performance monitor's pointer (`vc4->active_perfmon`) is still
retained.

If we open a new file descriptor and submit a few jobs with performance
monitors, the driver will attempt to stop the active performance monitor
using the stale pointer in `vc4->active_perfmon`. However, this pointer
is no longer valid because the previous process has already terminated,
and all performance monitors associated with it have been destroyed and
freed.

To fix this, when the active performance monitor belongs to a given
process, explicitly stop it before destroying and freeing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50187 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
