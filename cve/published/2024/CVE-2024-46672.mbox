Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Handle SSID based pmksa deletion

wpa_supplicant 2.11 sends since 1efdba5fdc2c ("Handle PMKSA flush in the
driver for SAE/OWE offload cases") SSID based PMKSA del commands.
brcmfmac is not prepared and tries to dereference the NULL bssid and
pmkid pointers in cfg80211_pmksa. PMKID_V3 operations support SSID based
updates so copy the SSID.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46672 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4291f94f8c6b01505132c22ee27b59ed27c3584f
