Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: single: fix potential NULL dereference in pcs_get_function()

pinmux_generic_get_function() can return NULL and the pointer 'function'
was dereferenced without checking against NULL. Add checking of pointer
'function' in pcs_get_function().

Found by code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46685 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
