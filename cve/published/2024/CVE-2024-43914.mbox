Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid5: avoid BUG_ON() while continue reshape after reassembling

Currently, mdadm support --revert-reshape to abort the reshape while
reassembling, as the test 07revert-grow. However, following BUG_ON()
can be triggerred by the test:

kernel BUG at drivers/md/raid5.c:6278!
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI
irq event stamp: 158985
CPU: 6 PID: 891 Comm: md0_reshape Not tainted 6.9.0-03335-g7592a0b0049a #94
RIP: 0010:reshape_request+0x3f1/0xe60
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 raid5_sync_request+0x43d/0x550
 md_do_sync+0xb7a/0x2110
 md_thread+0x294/0x2b0
 kthread+0x147/0x1c0
 ret_from_fork+0x59/0x70
 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30
 </TASK>

Root cause is that --revert-reshape update the raid_disks from 5 to 4,
while reshape position is still set, and after reassembling the array,
reshape position will be read from super block, then during reshape the
checking of 'writepos' that is caculated by old reshape position will
fail.

Fix this panic the easy way first, by converting the BUG_ON() to
WARN_ON(), and stop the reshape if checkings fail.

Noted that mdadm must fix --revert-shape as well, and probably md/raid
should enhance metadata validation as well, however this means
reassemble will fail and there must be user tools to fix the wrong
metadata.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43914 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
