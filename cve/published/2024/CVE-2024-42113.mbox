Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: txgbe: initialize num_q_vectors for MSI/INTx interrupts

When using MSI/INTx interrupts, wx->num_q_vectors is uninitialized.
Thus there will be kernel panic in wx_alloc_q_vectors() to allocate
queue vectors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42113 to this issue.

	drivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/libwx/wx_lib.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
