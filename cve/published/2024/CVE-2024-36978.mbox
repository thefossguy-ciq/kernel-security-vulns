Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: sch_multiq: fix possible OOB write in multiq_tune()

q->bands will be assigned to qopt->bands to execute subsequent code logic
after kmalloc. So the old q->bands should not be used in kmalloc.
Otherwise, an out-of-bounds write will occur.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36978 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.4 with commit c2999f7fb05b and fixed in 6.10-rc3 with commit affc18fdc694

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-36978
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/sched/sch_multiq.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
