Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: geni-se: fix array underflow in geni_se_clk_tbl_get()

This loop is supposed to break if the frequency returned from
clk_round_rate() is the same as on the previous iteration.  However,
that check doesn't make sense on the first iteration through the loop.
It leads to reading before the start of these->clk_perf_tbl[] array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
