Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: musb: sunxi: Fix accessing an released usb phy

Commit 6ed05c68cbca ("usb: musb: sunxi: Explicitly release USB PHY on
exit") will cause that usb phy @glue->xceiv is accessed after released.

1) register platform driver @sunxi_musb_driver
// get the usb phy @glue->xceiv
sunxi_musb_probe() -> devm_usb_get_phy().

2) register and unregister platform driver @musb_driver
musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init()
use the phy here
//the phy is released here
musb_remove() -> sunxi_musb_exit() -> devm_usb_put_phy()

3) register @musb_driver again
musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init()
use the phy here but the phy has been released at 2).
...

Fixed by reverting the commit, namely, removing devm_usb_put_phy()
from sunxi_musb_exit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
