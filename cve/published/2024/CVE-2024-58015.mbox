Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix for out-of bound access error

Selfgen stats are placed in a buffer using print_array_to_buf_index() function.
Array length parameter passed to the function is too big, resulting in possible
out-of bound memory error.
Decreasing buffer size by one fixes faulty upper bound of passed array.

Discovered in coverity scan, CID 1600742 and CID 1600758

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58015 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.13.3 with commit 8700c4bf8b7ed98037d2acf1eaf770ad6dd431d4

	drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/debugfs_htt_stats.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8700c4bf8b7ed98037d2acf1eaf770ad6dd431d4
