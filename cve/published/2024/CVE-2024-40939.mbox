Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: iosm: Fix tainted pointer delete is case of region creation fail

In case of region creation fail in ipc_devlink_create_region(), previously
created regions delete process starts from tainted pointer which actually
holds error code value.
Fix this bug by decreasing region index before delete.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
