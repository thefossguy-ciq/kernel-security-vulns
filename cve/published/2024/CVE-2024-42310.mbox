Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/gma500: fix null pointer dereference in cdv_intel_lvds_get_modes

In cdv_intel_lvds_get_modes(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate()
is assigned to mode, which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference on
failure of drm_mode_duplicate(). Add a check to avoid npd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42310 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
