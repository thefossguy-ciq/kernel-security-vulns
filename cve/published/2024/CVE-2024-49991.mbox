Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: amdkfd_free_gtt_mem clear the correct pointer

Pass pointer reference to amdgpu_bo_unref to clear the correct pointer,
otherwise amdgpu_bo_unref clear the local variable, the original pointer
not set to NULL, this could cause use-after-free bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
