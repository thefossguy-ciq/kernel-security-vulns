Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

openrisc: traps: Don't send signals to kernel mode threads

OpenRISC exception handling sends signals to user processes on floating
point exceptions and trap instructions (for debugging) among others.
There is a bug where the trap handling logic may send signals to kernel
threads, we should not send these signals to kernel threads, if that
happens we treat it as an error.

This patch adds conditions to die if the kernel receives these
exceptions in kernel mode code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38614 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
