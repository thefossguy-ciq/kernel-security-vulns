Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: CPPC: Make rmw_lock a raw_spin_lock

The following BUG was triggered:

=============================
[ BUG: Invalid wait context ]
6.12.0-rc2-XXX #406 Not tainted
-----------------------------
kworker/1:1/62 is trying to lock:
ffffff8801593030 (&cpc_ptr->rmw_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: cpc_write+0xcc/0x370
other info that might help us debug this:

sugov_update_shared() locks a raw_spinlock while cpc_write() locks a
spinlock.

To have a correct wait-type order, update rmw_lock to a raw spinlock and
ensure that interrupts will be disabled on the CPU holding it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
