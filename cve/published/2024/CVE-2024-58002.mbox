Subject: CVE-2024-58002: media: uvcvideo: Remove dangling pointers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Remove dangling pointers

When an async control is written, we copy a pointer to the file handle
that started the operation. That pointer will be used when the device is
done. Which could be anytime in the future.

If the user closes that file descriptor, its structure will be freed,
and there will be one dangling pointer per pending async control, that
the driver will try to use.

Clean all the dangling pointers during release().

To avoid adding a performance penalty in the most common case (no async
operation), a counter has been introduced with some logic to make sure
that it is properly handled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
