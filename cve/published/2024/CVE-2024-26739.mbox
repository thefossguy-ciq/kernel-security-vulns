Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_mirred: don't override retval if we already lost the skb

If we're redirecting the skb, and haven't called tcf_mirred_forward(),
yet, we need to tell the core to drop the skb by setting the retcode
to SHOT. If we have called tcf_mirred_forward(), however, the skb
is out of our hands and returning SHOT will lead to UaF.

Move the retval override to the error path which actually need it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26739 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
