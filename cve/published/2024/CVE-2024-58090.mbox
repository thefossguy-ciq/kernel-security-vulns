Subject: CVE-2024-58090: sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled

David reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:

  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220
   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180
   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250
   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

The corresponding interrupt flag trace:

  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90
  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90

That means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further
instrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec
jump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the
NEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked
cond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:

  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60
  down_timeout+0x18/0x60
  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80
  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100
  acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60
  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0
  acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190
  acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290
  irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60
  syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200
  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0
  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240
  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180

This is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with
the recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the
scheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and
invokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler
enables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above
warning at the end.

Quite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in
triggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not
have done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations
it's just a question of time.

The problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling
models. Full preemption is not affected as cond_resched() is disabled and
the preemption check preemptible() takes the interrupt disabled flag into
account.

Cure the problem by adding a corresponding check into cond_resched().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58090 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
