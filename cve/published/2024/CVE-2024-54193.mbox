Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix WARN in ivpu_ipc_send_receive_internal()

Move pm_runtime_set_active() to ivpu_pm_init() so when
ivpu_ipc_send_receive_internal() is executed before ivpu_pm_enable()
it already has correct runtime state, even if last resume was
not successful.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-54193 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/578874b2bb947e047708f4df286e4ff1ba6be3ad
