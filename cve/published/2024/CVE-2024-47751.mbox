Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: kirin: Fix buffer overflow in kirin_pcie_parse_port()

Within kirin_pcie_parse_port(), the pcie->num_slots is compared to
pcie->gpio_id_reset size (MAX_PCI_SLOTS) which is correct and would lead
to an overflow.

Thus, fix condition to pcie->num_slots + 1 >= MAX_PCI_SLOTS and move
pcie->num_slots increment below the if-statement to avoid out-of-bounds
array access.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
