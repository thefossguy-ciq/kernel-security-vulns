Subject: CVE-2024-46761: pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pci/hotplug/pnv_php: Fix hotplug driver crash on Powernv

The hotplug driver for powerpc (pci/hotplug/pnv_php.c) causes a kernel
crash when we try to hot-unplug/disable the PCIe switch/bridge from
the PHB.

The crash occurs because although the MSI data structure has been
released during disable/hot-unplug path and it has been assigned
with NULL, still during unregistration the code was again trying to
explicitly disable the MSI which causes the NULL pointer dereference and
kernel crash.

The patch fixes the check during unregistration path to prevent invoking
pci_disable_msi/msix() since its data structure is already freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46761 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
