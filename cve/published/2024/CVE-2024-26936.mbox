Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: validate request buffer size in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf()

The response buffer should be allocated in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf
before validating request. But the fields in payload as well as smb2 header
is used in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf(). This patch add simple buffer size
validation to avoid potencial out-of-bounds in request buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26936 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
