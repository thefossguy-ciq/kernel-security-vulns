Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Use reserved copy engine for user binds on faulting devices

User binds map to engines with can fault, faults depend on user binds
completion, thus we can deadlock. Avoid this by using reserved copy
engine for user binds on faulting devices.

While we are here, normalize bind queue creation with a helper.

v2:
 - Pass in extensions to bind queue creation (CI)
v3:
 - s/resevered/reserved (Lucas)
 - Fix NULL hwe check (Jonathan)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47729 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
