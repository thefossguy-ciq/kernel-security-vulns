Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/lam: Disable ADDRESS_MASKING in most cases

Linear Address Masking (LAM) has a weakness related to transient
execution as described in the SLAM paper[1]. Unless Linear Address
Space Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.

Until kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,
or when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,
otherwise keep LAM disabled.

There are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently
nobody is affected by this issue.

[ dhansen: update SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS -> CPU_MITIGATIONS ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
