Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation

Calculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value
between the requested size and the actual size does not consider
the partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.

Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the
total size is now deduced from the difference between the end and
start addresses.

Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer
and more understandable form.

Requires: 60a2066c5005 ("drm/i915/gem: Adjust vma offset for framebuffer mmap offset")
(cherry picked from commit 97b6784753da06d9d40232328efc5c5367e53417)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42259 to this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gem/i915_gem_mman.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
