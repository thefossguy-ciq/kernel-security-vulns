Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7921s: fix potential hung tasks during chip recovery

During chip recovery (e.g. chip reset), there is a possible situation that
kernel worker reset_work is holding the lock and waiting for kernel thread
stat_worker to be parked, while stat_worker is waiting for the release of
the same lock.
It causes a deadlock resulting in the dumping of hung tasks messages and
possible rebooting of the device.

This patch prevents the execution of stat_worker during the chip recovery.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40977 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.96 with commit 0b81faa05b0b

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
