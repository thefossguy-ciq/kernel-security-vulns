Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rpcrdma: Always release the rpcrdma_device's xa_array

Dai pointed out that the xa_init_flags() in rpcrdma_add_one() needs
to have a matching xa_destroy() in rpcrdma_remove_one() to release
underlying memory that the xarray might have accrued during
operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53077 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.11 with commit 7e86845a0346 and fixed in 6.11.7 with commit 36b7f5a4f300

	net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/ib_client.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36b7f5a4f300d038270324640ff7c1399245159d
