Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_event: Align BR/EDR JUST_WORKS paring with LE

This aligned BR/EDR JUST_WORKS method with LE which since 92516cd97fd4
("Bluetooth: Always request for user confirmation for Just Works")
always request user confirmation with confirm_hint set since the
likes of bluetoothd have dedicated policy around JUST_WORKS method
(e.g. main.conf:JustWorksRepairing).

CVE: CVE-2024-8805

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53144 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
