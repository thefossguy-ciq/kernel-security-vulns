Subject: CVE-2024-49891: scsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths

When the HBA is undergoing a reset or is handling an errata event, NULL ptr
dereference crashes may occur in routines such as
lpfc_sli_flush_io_rings(), lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_callbk(), or
lpfc_abort_handler().

Add NULL ptr checks before dereferencing hdwq pointers that may have been
freed due to operations colliding with a reset or errata event handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49891 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.10.14 with commit 99a801e2fca3
	Fixed in 6.11.3 with commit fd665c8dbdb1
	Fixed in 6.12-rc1 with commit 2be1d4f11944

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-49891
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
