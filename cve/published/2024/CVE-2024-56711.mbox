Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panel: himax-hx83102: Add a check to prevent NULL pointer dereference

drm_mode_duplicate() could return NULL due to lack of memory,
which will then call NULL pointer dereference. Add a check to
prevent it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/747547972e647509815ad8530ff09d62220a56c2
