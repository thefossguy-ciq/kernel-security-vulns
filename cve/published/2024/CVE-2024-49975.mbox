Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobes: fix kernel info leak via "[uprobes]" vma

xol_add_vma() maps the uninitialized page allocated by __create_xol_area()
into userspace. On some architectures (x86) this memory is readable even
without VM_READ, VM_EXEC results in the same pgprot_t as VM_EXEC|VM_READ,
although this doesn't really matter, debugger can read this memory anyway.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49975 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
