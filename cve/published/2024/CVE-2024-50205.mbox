Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: firewire-lib: Avoid division by zero in apply_constraint_to_size()

The step variable is initialized to zero. It is changed in the loop,
but if it's not changed it will remain zero. Add a variable check
before the division.

The observed behavior was introduced by commit 826b5de90c0b
("ALSA: firewire-lib: fix insufficient PCM rule for period/buffer size"),
and it is difficult to show that any of the interval parameters will
satisfy the snd_interval_test() condition with data from the
amdtp_rate_table[] table.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50205 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
