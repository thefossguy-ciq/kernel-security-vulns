Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk_iocost: fix more out of bound shifts

Recently running UBSAN caught few out of bound shifts in the
ioc_forgive_debts() function:

UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:2142:38
shift exponent 80 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long
long')
...
UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:2144:30
shift exponent 80 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long
long')
...
Call Trace:

Actual impact of this issue was not identified but I propose to fix the
undefined behaviour.
The proposed fix to prevent those out of bound shifts consist of
precalculating exponent before using it the shift operations by taking
min value from the actual exponent and maximum possible number of bits.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49933 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
