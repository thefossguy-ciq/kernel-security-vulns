Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix potential "struct net" leak in inet6_rtm_getaddr()

It seems that if userspace provides a correct IFA_TARGET_NETNSID value
but no IFA_ADDRESS and IFA_LOCAL attributes, inet6_rtm_getaddr()
returns -EINVAL with an elevated "struct net" refcount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27417 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
