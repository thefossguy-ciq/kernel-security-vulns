Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card init

The commit 81033c6b584b ("ALSA: core: Warn on empty module")
introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card
object creation, and it also wraps the code around it with '#ifdef
MODULE'.  This works in most cases, but the devils are always in
details.  "MODULE" is defined when the target code (i.e. the sound
core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller is
also built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in
(CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m),
the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, and
card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module
reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with the
code execution after the module removal.

For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out
of ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because the
module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.

Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would
lead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catch
perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's no
real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is pretty
rare.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38605 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
