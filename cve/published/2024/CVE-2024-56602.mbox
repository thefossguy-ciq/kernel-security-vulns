Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ieee802154: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in ieee802154_create()

sock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk object to the provided sock
object. If ieee802154_create() fails later, the allocated sk object is
freed, but the dangling pointer remains in the provided sock object, which
may allow use-after-free.

Clear the sk pointer in the sock object on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56602 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
