Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: davinci: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin

Using __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback being
discarded with CONFIG_MMC_DAVINCI=y. When such a device gets unbound (e.g.
using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed without the cleanup
being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix it by compiling in the
remove callback unconditionally.

This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:

WARNING: modpost: drivers/mmc/host/davinci_mmc: section mismatch in
reference: davinci_mmcsd_driver+0x10 (section: .data) ->
davinci_mmcsd_remove (section: .exit.text)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39484 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
