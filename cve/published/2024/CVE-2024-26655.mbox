Subject: CVE-2024-26655: Fix memory leak in posix_clock_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix memory leak in posix_clock_open()

If the clk ops.open() function returns an error, we don't release the
pccontext we allocated for this clock.

Re-organize the code slightly to make it all more obvious.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26655 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
