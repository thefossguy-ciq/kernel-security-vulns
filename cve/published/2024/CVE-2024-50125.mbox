Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: SCO: Fix UAF on sco_sock_timeout

conn->sk maybe have been unlinked/freed while waiting for sco_conn_lock
so this checks if the conn->sk is still valid by checking if it part of
sco_sk_list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50125 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
