Subject: CVE-2024-20607: pds_core: Prevent health thread from running during reset/remove

Description
===========

pds_core: Prevent health thread from running during reset/remove

The PCIe reset handlers can run at the same time as the
health thread. This can cause the health thread to
stomp on the PCIe reset. Fix this by preventing the
health thread from running while a PCIe reset is happening.

As part of this use timer_shutdown_sync() during reset and
remove to make sure the timer doesn't ever get rearmed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-20607 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/46826a384406
