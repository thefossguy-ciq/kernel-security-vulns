Subject: CVE-2024-50036: net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in dst_release()

dst_entries_add() uses per-cpu data that might be freed at netns
dismantle from ip6_route_net_exit() calling dst_entries_destroy()

Before ip6_route_net_exit() can be called, we release all
the dsts associated with this netns, via calls to dst_release(),
which waits an rcu grace period before calling dst_destroy()

dst_entries_add() use in dst_destroy() is racy, because
dst_entries_destroy() could have been called already.

Decrementing the number of dsts must happen sooner.

Notes:

1) in CONFIG_XFRM case, dst_destroy() can call
   dst_release_immediate(child), this might also cause UAF
   if the child does not have DST_NOCOUNT set.
   IPSEC maintainers might take a look and see how to address this.

2) There is also discussion about removing this count of dst,
   which might happen in future kernels.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50036 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
