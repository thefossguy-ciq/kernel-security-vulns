Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Resolve kernel panic during GPIO IRQ handling

Resolve kernel panic caused by improper handling of IRQs while
accessing GPIO values. This is done by replacing generic_handle_irq with
handle_nested_irq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
