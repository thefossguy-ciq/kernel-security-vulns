Subject: CVE-2024-27401: firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when fetching packet contents

Ensure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If
the length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get
will now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read
and a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27401 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.9 with commit 38762a0763c1

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-27401
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/firewire/nosy.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
