Subject: CVE-2024-58240: tls: separate no-async decryption request handling from async

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: separate no-async decryption request handling from async

If we're not doing async, the handling is much simpler. There's no
reference counting, we just need to wait for the completion to wake us
up and return its result.

We should preferably also use a separate crypto_wait. I'm not seeing a
UAF as I did in the past, I think aec7961916f3 ("tls: fix race between
async notify and socket close") took care of it.

This will make the next fix easier.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58240 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
