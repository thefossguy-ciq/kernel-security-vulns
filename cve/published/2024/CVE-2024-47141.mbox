Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinmux: Use sequential access to access desc->pinmux data

When two client of the same gpio call pinctrl_select_state() for the
same functionality, we are seeing NULL pointer issue while accessing
desc->mux_owner.

Let's say two processes A, B executing in pin_request() for the same pin
and process A updates the desc->mux_usecount but not yet updated the
desc->mux_owner while process B see the desc->mux_usecount which got
updated by A path and further executes strcmp and while accessing
desc->mux_owner it crashes with NULL pointer.

Serialize the access to mux related setting with a mutex lock.

	cpu0 (process A)			cpu1(process B)

pinctrl_select_state() {		  pinctrl_select_state() {
  pin_request() {				pin_request() {
  ...
						 ....
    } else {
         desc->mux_usecount++;
    						desc->mux_usecount && strcmp(desc->mux_owner, owner)) {

         if (desc->mux_usecount > 1)
               return 0;
         desc->mux_owner = owner;

  }						}

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47141 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/pinctrl/core.c
	drivers/pinctrl/core.h
	drivers/pinctrl/pinmux.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2da32aed4a97ca1d70fb8b77926f72f30ce5fb4b
