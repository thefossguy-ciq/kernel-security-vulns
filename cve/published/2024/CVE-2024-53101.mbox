Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: Fix uninitialized value issue in from_kuid and from_kgid

ocfs2_setattr() uses attr->ia_mode, attr->ia_uid and attr->ia_gid in
a trace point even though ATTR_MODE, ATTR_UID and ATTR_GID aren't set.

Initialize all fields of newattrs to avoid uninitialized variables, by
checking if ATTR_MODE, ATTR_UID, ATTR_GID are initialized, otherwise 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
