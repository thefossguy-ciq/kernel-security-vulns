Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM

Similar to commit cac075706f29 ("drm/panthor: Fix race when converting
group handle to group object") we need to use the XArray's internal
locking when retrieving a vm pointer from there.

v2: Removed part of the patch that was trying to protect fetching
the heap pointer from XArray, as that operation is protected by
the @pool->lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53080 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.10 with commit 647810ec2476 and fixed in 6.11.8 with commit 3342f066a8e1

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-53080
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/panthor/panthor_mmu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3342f066a8e1020a6f7d1fbd6b23bfdeda473eb5
