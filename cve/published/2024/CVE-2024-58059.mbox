Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix deadlock during uvc_probe

If uvc_probe() fails, it can end up calling uvc_status_unregister() before
uvc_status_init() is called.

Fix this by checking if dev->status is NULL or not in
uvc_status_unregister().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58059 to this issue.

	drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_status.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db577ededf3a18b39567fc1a6209f12a0c4a3c52
