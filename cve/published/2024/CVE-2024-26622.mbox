Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head->write_buf when write()
of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head->write_buf after
head->io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can
cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26622 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 3.1 with commit bd03a3e4c9a9 and fixed in 6.8-rc7 with commit 2f03fc340cac

Please see https://www.kernel.org or a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-26622
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	security/tomoyo/common.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
