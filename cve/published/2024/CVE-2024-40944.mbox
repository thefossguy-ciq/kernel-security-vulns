Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/kexec: Fix bug with call depth tracking

The call to cc_platform_has() triggers a fault and system crash if call depth
tracking is active because the GS segment has been reset by load_segments() and
GS_BASE is now 0 but call depth tracking uses per-CPU variables to operate.

Call cc_platform_has() earlier in the function when GS is still valid.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
