Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: gcc-ipq9574: fix terminating of frequency table arrays

The frequency table arrays are supposed to be terminated with an
empty element. Add such entry to the end of the arrays where it
is missing in order to avoid possible out-of-bound access when
the table is traversed by functions like qcom_find_freq() or
qcom_find_freq_floor().

Only compile tested.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26968 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
