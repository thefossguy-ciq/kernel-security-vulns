Subject: CVE-2024-26686: fs/proc: do_task_stat: use sig->stats_lock to gather the threads/children stats

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc: do_task_stat: use sig->stats_lock to gather the threads/children stats

lock_task_sighand() can trigger a hard lockup.  If NR_CPUS threads call
do_task_stat() at the same time and the process has NR_THREADS, it will
spin with irqs disabled O(NR_CPUS * NR_THREADS) time.

Change do_task_stat() to use sig->stats_lock to gather the statistics
outside of ->siglock protected section, in the likely case this code will
run lockless.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
