Subject: CVE-2024-58096: wifi: ath11k: add srng->lock for ath11k_hal_srng_* in monitor mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: add srng->lock for ath11k_hal_srng_* in monitor mode

ath11k_hal_srng_* should be used with srng->lock to protect srng data.

For ath11k_dp_rx_mon_dest_process() and ath11k_dp_full_mon_process_rx(),
they use ath11k_hal_srng_* for many times but never call srng->lock.

So when running (full) monitor mode, warning will occur:
RIP: 0010:ath11k_hal_srng_dst_peek+0x18/0x30 [ath11k]
Call Trace:
 ? ath11k_hal_srng_dst_peek+0x18/0x30 [ath11k]
 ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status+0xc45/0x1190 [ath11k]
 ? idr_alloc_u32+0x97/0xd0
 ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_rings+0x32a/0x550 [ath11k]
 ath11k_dp_service_srng+0x289/0x5a0 [ath11k]
 ath11k_pcic_ext_grp_napi_poll+0x30/0xd0 [ath11k]
 __napi_poll+0x30/0x1f0
 net_rx_action+0x198/0x320
 __do_softirq+0xdd/0x319

So add srng->lock for them to avoid such warnings.

Inorder to fetch the srng->lock, should change srng's definition from
'void' to 'struct hal_srng'. And initialize them elsewhere to prevent
one line of code from being too long. This is consistent with other ring
process functions, such as ath11k_dp_process_rx().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
