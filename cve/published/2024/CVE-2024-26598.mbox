Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache

There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation
cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such
as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq
before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.

Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq
and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26598 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
