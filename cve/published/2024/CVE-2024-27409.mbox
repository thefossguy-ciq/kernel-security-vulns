Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: dw-edma: HDMA: Add sync read before starting the DMA transfer in remote setup

The Linked list element and pointer are not stored in the same memory as
the HDMA controller register. If the doorbell register is toggled before
the full write of the linked list a race condition error will occur.
In remote setup we can only use a readl to the memory to assure the full
write has occurred.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27409 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/dma/dw-edma/dw-hdma-v0-core.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
