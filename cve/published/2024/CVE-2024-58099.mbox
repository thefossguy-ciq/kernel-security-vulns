Subject: CVE-2024-58099: vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmxnet3: Fix packet corruption in vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame

Andrew and Nikolay reported connectivity issues with Cilium's service
load-balancing in case of vmxnet3.

If a BPF program for native XDP adds an encapsulation header such as
IPIP and transmits the packet out the same interface, then in case
of vmxnet3 a corrupted packet is being sent and subsequently dropped
on the path.

vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_frame() which is called e.g. via vmxnet3_run_xdp()
through vmxnet3_xdp_xmit_back() calculates an incorrect DMA address:

  page = virt_to_page(xdpf->data);
  tbi->dma_addr = page_pool_get_dma_addr(page) +
                  VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM;
  dma_sync_single_for_device(&adapter->pdev->dev,
                             tbi->dma_addr, buf_size,
                             DMA_TO_DEVICE);

The above assumes a fixed offset (VMXNET3_XDP_HEADROOM), but the XDP
BPF program could have moved xdp->data. While the passed buf_size is
correct (xdpf->len), the dma_addr needs to have a dynamic offset which
can be calculated as xdpf->data - (void *)xdpf, that is, xdp->data -
xdp->data_hard_start.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58099 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
