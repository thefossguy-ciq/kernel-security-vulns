Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: BTLB: Fix crash when setting up BTLB at CPU bringup

When using hotplug and bringing up a 32-bit CPU, ask the firmware about the
BTLB information to set up the static (block) TLB entries.

For that write access to the static btlb_info struct is needed, but
since it is marked __ro_after_init the kernel segfaults with missing
write permissions.

Fix the crash by dropping the __ro_after_init annotation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26705 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
