Subject: CVE-2024-46751: btrfs: don't BUG_ON() when 0 reference count at btrfs_lookup_extent_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: don't BUG_ON() when 0 reference count at btrfs_lookup_extent_info()

Instead of doing a BUG_ON() handle the error by returning -EUCLEAN,
aborting the transaction and logging an error message.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
