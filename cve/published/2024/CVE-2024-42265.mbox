Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

protect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictions

both callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;
however, misprediction might end up with
        tofree = fdt->fd[fd];
being speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasons
why it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the same
solution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ
from fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42265 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.104 with commit 5db999fff545
	Fixed in 6.6.45 with commit da72e783afd2
	Fixed in 6.10.4 with commit 1171ceccabfd
	Fixed in 6.11-rc2 with commit 8aa37bde1a7b

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-42265
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
