Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: add missing range check in bitmap_ip_uadt

When tb[IPSET_ATTR_IP_TO] is not present but tb[IPSET_ATTR_CIDR] exists,
the values of ip and ip_to are slightly swapped. Therefore, the range check
for ip should be done later, but this part is missing and it seems that the
vulnerability occurs.

So we should add missing range checks and remove unnecessary range checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53141 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
