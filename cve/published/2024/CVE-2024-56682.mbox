Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/riscv-aplic: Prevent crash when MSI domain is missing

If the APLIC driver is probed before the IMSIC driver, the parent MSI
domain will be missing, which causes a NULL pointer dereference in
msi_create_device_irq_domain().

Avoid this by deferring probe until the parent MSI domain is available. Use
dev_err_probe() to avoid printing an error message when returning
-EPROBE_DEFER.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56682 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/285a07810ab3bcedc2bd380ebacbf6b4942a889a
