Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning

We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the
controller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will
wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that
action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the
partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53093 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.118 with commit 60de2e03f984
	Fixed in 6.6.62 with commit 4a57f42e5ed4

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-53093
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/nvme/host/multipath.c
	drivers/nvme/host/nvme.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
