Subject: CVE-2024-58098: bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58098 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
