Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: keystone: Add workaround for Errata #i2037 (AM65x SR 1.0)

Errata #i2037 in AM65x/DRA80xM Processors Silicon Revision 1.0
(SPRZ452D_July 2018_Revised December 2019 [1]) mentions when an
inbound PCIe TLP spans more than two internal AXI 128-byte bursts,
the bus may corrupt the packet payload and the corrupt data may
cause associated applications or the processor to hang.

The workaround for Errata #i2037 is to limit the maximum read
request size and maximum payload size to 128 bytes. Add workaround
for Errata #i2037 here.

The errata and workaround is applicable only to AM65x SR 1.0 and
later versions of the silicon will have this fixed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
