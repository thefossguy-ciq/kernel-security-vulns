Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: Initialize beyond-EOF page contents before setting uptodate

fuse_notify_store(), unlike fuse_do_readpage(), does not enable page
zeroing (because it can be used to change partial page contents).

So fuse_notify_store() must be more careful to fully initialize page
contents (including parts of the page that are beyond end-of-file)
before marking the page uptodate.

The current code can leave beyond-EOF page contents uninitialized, which
makes these uninitialized page contents visible to userspace via mmap().

This is an information leak, but only affects systems which do not
enable init-on-alloc (via CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y or the
corresponding kernel command line parameter).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
