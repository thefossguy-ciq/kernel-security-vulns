Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kvm: s390: Reject memory region operations for ucontrol VMs

This change rejects the KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION and
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2 ioctls when called on a ucontrol VM.
This is necessary since ucontrol VMs have kvm->arch.gmap set to 0 and
would thus result in a null pointer dereference further in.
Memory management needs to be performed in userspace and using the
ioctls KVM_S390_UCAS_MAP and KVM_S390_UCAS_UNMAP.

Also improve s390 specific documentation for KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION
and KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION2.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/49c9945c054df4c22008e2bf87ca74d3e2507aa6
