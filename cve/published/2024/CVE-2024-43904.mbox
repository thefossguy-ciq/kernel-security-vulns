Subject: CVE-2024-43904: drm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing

This commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables in
the dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables were
previously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later in
the code without checking if they were null. This could potentially lead
to a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.

The null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null before
they are used, preventing potential crashes.

Fixes the below static smatch checker:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:938 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'stream' could be null (see line 922)
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:940 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'plane' could be null (see line 922)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43904 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16a8a2a839d19c4cf7253642b493ffb8eee1d857
