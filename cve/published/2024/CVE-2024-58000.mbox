Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: prevent reg-wait speculations

With *ENTER_EXT_ARG_REG instead of passing a user pointer with arguments
for the waiting loop the user can specify an offset into a pre-mapped
region of memory, in which case the
[offset, offset + sizeof(io_uring_reg_wait)) will be intepreted as the
argument.

As we address a kernel array using a user given index, it'd be a subject
to speculation type of exploits. Use array_index_nospec() to prevent
that. Make sure to pass not the full region size but truncate by the
maximum offset allowed considering the structure size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58000 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	io_uring/io_uring.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a6de94df7bfa76d9850443547e7b3333f63a16a
