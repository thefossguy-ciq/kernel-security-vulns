Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time

When using MSI/INTx interrupt, the shared interrupts are still being
handled in the device remove routine, before free IRQs. So isb memory
is still read after it is freed. Thus move wx_free_isb_resources()
from txgbe_close() to txgbe_remove(). And fix the improper isb free
action in txgbe_open() error handling path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
