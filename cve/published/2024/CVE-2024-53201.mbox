Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe

This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in
dcn20_program_pipe(). Previously, commit 8e4ed3cf1642 ("drm/amd/display:
Add null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe")
partially fixed the null pointer dereference issue. However, in
dcn20_update_dchubp_dpp(), the variable pipe_ctx is passed in, and
plane_state is accessed again through pipe_ctx. Multiple if statements
directly call attributes of plane_state, leading to potential null
pointer dereference issues. This patch adds necessary null checks to
ensure stability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53201 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b4ee2560d4d8de2688da68cd9581177035e0876
