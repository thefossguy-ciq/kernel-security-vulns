Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: mst: pass vlan group directly to br_mst_vlan_set_state

Pass the already obtained vlan group pointer to br_mst_vlan_set_state()
instead of dereferencing it again. Each caller has already correctly
dereferenced it for their context. This change is required for the
following suspicious RCU dereference fix. No functional changes
intended.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40921 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
