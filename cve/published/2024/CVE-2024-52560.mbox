Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Mark inode as bad as soon as error detected in mi_enum_attr()

Extended the `mi_enum_attr()` function interface with an additional
parameter, `struct ntfs_inode *ni`, to allow marking the inode
as bad as soon as an error is detected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-52560 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.13.4 with commit d9c699f2c4dc174940ffe8600b20c267897da155

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
