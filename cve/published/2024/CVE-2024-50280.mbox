Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm cache: fix flushing uninitialized delayed_work on cache_ctr error

An unexpected WARN_ON from flush_work() may occur when cache creation
fails, caused by destroying the uninitialized delayed_work waker in the
error path of cache_create(). For example, the warning appears on the
superblock checksum error.

Reproduce steps:

dmsetup create cmeta --table "0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0"
dmsetup create cdata --table "0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192"
dmsetup create corig --table "0 524288 linear /dev/sdc 262144"
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 oflag=direct
dmsetup create cache --table "0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \
/dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0"

Kernel logs:

(snip)
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 84 at kernel/workqueue.c:4178 __flush_work+0x5d4/0x890

Fix by pulling out the cancel_delayed_work_sync() from the constructor's
error path. This patch doesn't affect the use-after-free fix for
concurrent dm_resume and dm_destroy (commit 6a459d8edbdb ("dm cache: Fix
UAF in destroy()")) as cache_dtr is not changed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50280 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
