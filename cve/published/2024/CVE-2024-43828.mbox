Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix infinite loop when replaying fast_commit

When doing fast_commit replay an infinite loop may occur due to an
uninitialized extent_status struct.  ext4_ext_determine_insert_hole() does
not detect the replay and calls ext4_es_find_extent_range(), which will
return immediately without initializing the 'es' variable.

Because 'es' contains garbage, an integer overflow may happen causing an
infinite loop in this function, easily reproducible using fstest generic/039.

This commit fixes this issue by unconditionally initializing the structure
in function ext4_es_find_extent_range().

Thanks to Zhang Yi, for figuring out the real problem!

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/181e63cd595c688194e07332f9944b3a63193de2
