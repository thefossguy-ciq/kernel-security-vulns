Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: misc_minor_alloc to use ida for all dynamic/misc dynamic minors

misc_minor_alloc was allocating id using ida for minor only in case of
MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR but misc_minor_free was always freeing ids
using ida_free causing a mismatch and following warn:
> > WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 159 at lib/idr.c:525 ida_free+0x3e0/0x41f
> > ida_free called for id=127 which is not allocated.
> > <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
...
> > [<60941eb4>] ida_free+0x3e0/0x41f
> > [<605ac993>] misc_minor_free+0x3e/0xbc
> > [<605acb82>] misc_deregister+0x171/0x1b3

misc_minor_alloc is changed to allocate id from ida for all minors
falling in the range of dynamic/ misc dynamic minors

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
