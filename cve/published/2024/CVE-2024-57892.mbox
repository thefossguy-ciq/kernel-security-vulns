Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv

When mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a
slab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to
quota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the
dangling pointer.

During the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never
set as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option
for remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the
DQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the
next quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the
quota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.

To fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with
read-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e3d203b1adede46bbba049e497765d67865be18
