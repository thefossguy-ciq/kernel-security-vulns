Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: xilinx: axienet: Enqueue Tx packets in dql before dmaengine starts

Enqueue packets in dql after dma engine starts causes race condition.
Tx transfer starts once dma engine is started and may execute dql dequeue
in completion before it gets queued. It results in following kernel crash
while running iperf stress test:

kernel BUG at lib/dynamic_queue_limits.c:99!

Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] SMP

Start dmaengine after enqueue in dql fixes the crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50297 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/xilinx_axienet_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/def3dee25cbd1c9b2ed443c3f6180e952563de77
