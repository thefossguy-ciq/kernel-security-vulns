Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

safesetid: check size of policy writes

syzbot attempts to write a buffer with a large size to a sysfs entry
with writes handled by handle_policy_update(), triggering a warning
in kmalloc.

Check the size specified for write buffers before allocating.

[PM: subject tweak]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58016 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
