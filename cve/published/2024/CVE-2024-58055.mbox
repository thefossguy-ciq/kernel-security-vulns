Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_tcm: Don't free command immediately

Don't prematurely free the command. Wait for the status completion of
the sense status. It can be freed then. Otherwise we will double-free
the command.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
