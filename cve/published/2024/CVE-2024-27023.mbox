Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: Fix missing release of 'active_io' for flush

submit_flushes
 atomic_set(&mddev->flush_pending, 1);
 rdev_for_each_rcu(rdev, mddev)
  atomic_inc(&mddev->flush_pending);
  bi->bi_end_io = md_end_flush
  submit_bio(bi);
                        /* flush io is done first */
                        md_end_flush
                         if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))
                          percpu_ref_put(&mddev->active_io)
                          -> active_io is not released

 if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->flush_pending))
  -> missing release of active_io

For consequence, mddev_suspend() will wait for 'active_io' to be zero
forever.

Fix this problem by releasing 'active_io' in submit_flushes() if
'flush_pending' is decreased to zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27023 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
