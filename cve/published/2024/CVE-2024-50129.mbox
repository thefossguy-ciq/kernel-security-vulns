Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: pse-pd: Fix out of bound for loop

Adjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over
PI structures. The loop should not reach the index pcdev->nr_lines since
we allocate exactly pcdev->nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix
ensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50129 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.10 with commit 9be9567a7c59 and fixed in 6.11.6 with commit 50ea68146d82
	Issue introduced in 6.10 with commit 9be9567a7c59 and fixed in 6.12-rc5 with commit f2767a41959e

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-50129
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/pse-pd/pse_core.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
