Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: i801: Fix block process call transactions

According to the Intel datasheets, software must reset the block
buffer index twice for block process call transactions: once before
writing the outgoing data to the buffer, and once again before
reading the incoming data from the buffer.

The driver is currently missing the second reset, causing the wrong
portion of the block buffer to be read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26593 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
