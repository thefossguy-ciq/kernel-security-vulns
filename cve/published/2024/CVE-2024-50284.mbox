Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix the missing xa_store error check

xa_store() can fail, it return xa_err(-EINVAL) if the entry cannot
be stored in an XArray, or xa_err(-ENOMEM) if memory allocation failed,
so check error for xa_store() to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50284 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
