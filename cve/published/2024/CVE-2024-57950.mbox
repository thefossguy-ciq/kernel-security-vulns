Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Initialize denominator defaults to 1

[WHAT & HOW]
Variables, used as denominators and maybe not assigned to other values,
should be initialized to non-zero to avoid DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, as reported
by Coverity.

(cherry picked from commit e2c4c6c10542ccfe4a0830bb6c9fd5b177b7bbb7)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57950 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml2/dml21/src/dml2_core/dml2_core_dcn4_calcs.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c9d6afb4f9c338049662d27d169fba7dd60e337d
