Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout

While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it to
collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while it is being
released from the commit path.

Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x
with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since
7395dfacfff6 ("netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set
element timeout").

Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc
in this case.

According to 08e4c8c5919f ("netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on
transaction abort"), Florian plans to accelerate abort path by releasing
objects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort
path too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26643 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.5 with commit 5f68718b34a5 and fixed in 6.8 with commit 552705a3650b

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-26643
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
