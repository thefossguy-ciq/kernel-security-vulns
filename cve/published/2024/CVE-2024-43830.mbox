Subject: CVE-2024-43830: leds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

leds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()

Triggers which have trigger specific sysfs attributes typically store
related data in trigger-data allocated by the activate() callback and
freed by the deactivate() callback.

Calling device_remove_groups() after calling deactivate() leaves a window
where the sysfs attributes show/store functions could be called after
deactivation and then operate on the just freed trigger-data.

Move the device_remove_groups() call to before deactivate() to close
this race window.

This also makes the deactivation path properly do things in reverse order
of the activation path which calls the activate() callback before calling
device_add_groups().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43830 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
