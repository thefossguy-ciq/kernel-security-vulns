Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null check for 'afb' in amdgpu_dm_update_cursor (v2)

This commit adds a null check for the 'afb' variable in the
amdgpu_dm_update_cursor function. Previously, 'afb' was assumed to be
null at line 8388, but was used later in the code without a null check.
This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.

Changes since v1:
- Moved the null check for 'afb' to the line where 'afb' is used. (Alex)

Fixes the below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:8433 amdgpu_dm_update_cursor()
	error: we previously assumed 'afb' could be null (see line 8388)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49908 to this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a742168b6a39ead257da53bcbe472384d6e14a1b
