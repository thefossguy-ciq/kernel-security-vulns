Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: qcom: qmp-usb-legacy: fix NULL-deref on runtime suspend

Commit 413db06c05e7 ("phy: qcom-qmp-usb: clean up probe initialisation")
removed most users of the platform device driver data from the
qcom-qmp-usb driver, but mistakenly also removed the initialisation
despite the data still being used in the runtime PM callbacks. This bug
was later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the
qmp-usb-legacy driver.

Restore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointer
dereference on runtime suspend.

Apparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabled
manually through sysfs, with these drivers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50239 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e8066811a2c43fbb5f53c2c26d389e4bab9da34
