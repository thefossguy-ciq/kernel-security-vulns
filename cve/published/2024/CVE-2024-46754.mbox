Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.

The syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked
via bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()
first.

Martin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL
probably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a
("ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF"). The reason is that the
per-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the self
test case but each BPF function expects it.

Remove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46754 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cd15511de7c619bbd0f54bb3f28e6e720ded5d6
