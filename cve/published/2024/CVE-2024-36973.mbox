Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: fix double free in the error handling of gp_aux_bus_probe()

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function
gp_auxiliary_device_release() calls ida_free() and
kfree(aux_device_wrapper) to free memory. We should't
call them again in the error handling path.

Fix this by skipping the redundant cleanup functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36973 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.1 with commit 393fc2f5948f and fixed in 6.10-rc4 with commit 086c6cbcc563

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-36973
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/misc/mchp_pci1xxxx/mchp_pci1xxxx_gp.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
