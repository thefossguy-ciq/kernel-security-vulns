Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add Cleaner Shader Deinitialization in gfx_v9_0 Module

This commit addresses an omission in the previous patch related to the
cleaner shader support for GFX9 hardware. Specifically, it adds the
necessary deinitialization code for the cleaner shader in the
gfx_v9_0_sw_fini function.

The added line amdgpu_gfx_cleaner_shader_sw_fini(adev); ensures that any
allocated resources for the cleaner shader are freed correctly, avoiding
potential memory leaks and ensuring that the GPU state is clean for the
next initialization sequence.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56753 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/gfx_v9_0.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/720c0376b3d29cbab921a60062fda5980742ed9d
