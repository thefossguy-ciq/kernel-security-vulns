Subject: CVE-2024-27056: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: ensure offloading TID queue exists

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: ensure offloading TID queue exists

The resume code path assumes that the TX queue for the offloading TID
has been configured. At resume time it then tries to sync the write
pointer as it may have been updated by the firmware.

In the unusual event that no packets have been send on TID 0, the queue
will not have been allocated and this causes a crash. Fix this by
ensuring the queue exist at suspend time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
