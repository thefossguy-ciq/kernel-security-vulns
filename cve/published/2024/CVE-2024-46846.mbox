Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: rockchip: Resolve unbalanced runtime PM / system PM handling

Commit e882575efc77 ("spi: rockchip: Suspend and resume the bus during
NOIRQ_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM ops") stopped respecting runtime PM status and
simply disabled clocks unconditionally when suspending the system. This
causes problems when the device is already runtime suspended when we go
to sleep -- in which case we double-disable clocks and produce a
WARNing.

Switch back to pm_runtime_force_{suspend,resume}(), because that still
seems like the right thing to do, and the aforementioned commit makes no
explanation why it stopped using it.

Also, refactor some of the resume() error handling, because it's not
actually a good idea to re-disable clocks on failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46846 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
