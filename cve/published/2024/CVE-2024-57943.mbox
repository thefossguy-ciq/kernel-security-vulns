Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix the new buffer was not zeroed before writing

Before writing, if a buffer_head marked as new, its data must
be zeroed, otherwise uninitialized data in the page cache will
be written.

So this commit uses folio_zero_new_buffers() to zero the new
buffers before ->write_end().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/942c6f91ab8d82a41650e717940b4e577173762f
