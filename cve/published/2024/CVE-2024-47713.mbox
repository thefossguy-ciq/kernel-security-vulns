Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: use two-phase skb reclamation in ieee80211_do_stop()

Since '__dev_queue_xmit()' should be called with interrupts enabled,
the following backtrace:

ieee80211_do_stop()
 ...
 spin_lock_irqsave(&local->queue_stop_reason_lock, flags)
 ...
 ieee80211_free_txskb()
  ieee80211_report_used_skb()
   ieee80211_report_ack_skb()
    cfg80211_mgmt_tx_status_ext()
     nl80211_frame_tx_status()
      genlmsg_multicast_netns()

	     netlink_deliver_tap()
	      __netlink_deliver_tap_skb()
	       dev_queue_xmit()
	        __dev_queue_xmit() ; with IRQS disabled
 ...
 spin_unlock_irqrestore(&local->queue_stop_reason_lock, flags)

issues the warning (as reported by syzbot reproducer):

WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5128 at kernel/softirq.c:362 __local_bh_enable_ip+0xc3/0x120

Fix this by implementing a two-phase skb reclamation in
'ieee80211_do_stop()', where actual work is performed
outside of a section with interrupts disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47713 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
