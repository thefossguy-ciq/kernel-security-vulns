Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sd: Fix off-by-one error in sd_read_block_characteristics()

Ff the device returns page 0xb1 with length 8 (happens with qemu v2.x, for
example), sd_read_block_characteristics() may attempt an out-of-bounds
memory access when accessing the zoned field at offset 8.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47682 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
