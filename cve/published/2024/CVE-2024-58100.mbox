Subject: CVE-2024-58100: bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   -->    bpf_prog_is_offloaded
      bpf_prog_is_offloaded           check_cfg
      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env->ops
- prog->aux->attach_btf_trace
- prog->aux->attach_func_name
- prog->aux->attach_func_proto
- prog->aux->dst_trampoline
- prog->aux->mod
- prog->aux->saved_dst_attach_type
- prog->aux->saved_dst_prog_type
- prog->expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58100 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	include/linux/bpf.h
	kernel/bpf/verifier.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3846e2bea565ee1c5195dcc625fda9868fb0e3b3
