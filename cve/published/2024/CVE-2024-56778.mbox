Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sti: avoid potential dereference of error pointers in sti_hqvdp_atomic_check

The return value of drm_atomic_get_crtc_state() needs to be
checked. To avoid use of error pointer 'crtc_state' in case
of the failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56778 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
