Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: rt5033: Bring back i2c_set_clientdata

Commit 3a93da231c12 ("power: supply: rt5033: Use devm_power_supply_register() helper")
reworked the driver to use devm. While at it, the i2c_set_clientdata
was dropped along with the remove callback. Unfortunately other parts
of the driver also rely on i2c clientdata so this causes kernel oops.

Bring the call back to fix the driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44936 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c5d0871b0af0184abc6f7f52f8705b39a6251ae
