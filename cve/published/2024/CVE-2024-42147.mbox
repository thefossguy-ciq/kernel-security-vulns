Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/debugfs - Fix debugfs uninit process issue

During the zip probe process, the debugfs failure does not stop
the probe. When debugfs initialization fails, jumping to the
error branch will also release regs, in addition to its own
rollback operation.

As a result, it may be released repeatedly during the regs
uninit process. Therefore, the null check needs to be added to
the regs uninit process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42147 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.98 with commit eda60520cfe3
	Fixed in 6.6.39 with commit 7fc8d9a525b5
	Fixed in 6.9.9 with commit e0a2d2df9ba7
	Fixed in 6.10 with commit 8be091338971

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-42147
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/crypto/hisilicon/debugfs.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
