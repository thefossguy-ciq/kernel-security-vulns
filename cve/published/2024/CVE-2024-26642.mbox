Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: disallow anonymous set with timeout flag

Anonymous sets are never used with timeout from userspace, reject this.
Exception to this rule is NFT_SET_EVAL to ensure legacy meters still work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26642 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 4.1 with commit 761da2935d6e and fixed in 6.8 with commit 16603605b667

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-26642
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
