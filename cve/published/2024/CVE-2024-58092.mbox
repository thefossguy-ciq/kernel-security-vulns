Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix legacy client tracking initialization

Get rid of the nfsd4_legacy_tracking_ops->init() call in
check_for_legacy_methods().  That will be handled in the caller
(nfsd4_client_tracking_init()).  Otherwise, we'll wind up calling
nfsd4_legacy_tracking_ops->init() twice, and the second time we'll
trigger the BUG_ON() in nfsd4_init_recdir().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
