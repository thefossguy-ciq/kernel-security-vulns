Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd: Guard against bad data for ATIF ACPI method

If a BIOS provides bad data in response to an ATIF method call
this causes a NULL pointer dereference in the caller.

```

```

It has been encountered on at least one system, so guard for it.

	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_acpi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
