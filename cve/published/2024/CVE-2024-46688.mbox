Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails

If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to
memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),
new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid
memory leaks.

However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can
lead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.

Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/49c0e081998008cde0c872c0ff9affa1ece4b878
