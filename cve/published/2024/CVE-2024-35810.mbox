Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix the lifetime of the bo cursor memory

The cleanup can be dispatched while the atomic update is still active,
which means that the memory acquired in the atomic update needs to
not be invalidated by the cleanup. The buffer objects in vmw_plane_state
instead of using the builtin map_and_cache were trying to handle
the lifetime of the mapped memory themselves, leading to crashes.

Use the map_and_cache instead of trying to manage the lifetime of the
buffer objects held by the vmw_plane_state.

Fixes kernel oops'es in IGT's kms_cursor_legacy forked-bo.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35810 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
