Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: keystone: Fix if-statement expression in ks_pcie_quirk()

This code accidentally uses && where || was intended.  It potentially
results in a NULL dereference.

Thus, fix the if-statement expression to use the correct condition.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
