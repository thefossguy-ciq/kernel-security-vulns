Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix potential out-of-bounds access in 'amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init()'

The issue arises when the array 'adev->vcn.vcn_config' is accessed
before checking if the index 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within the
bounds of the array.

The fix involves moving the bounds check before the array access. This
ensures that 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' is within the bounds of the array
before it is used as an index.

Fixes the below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_discovery.c:1289 amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init() error: testing array offset 'adev->vcn.num_vcn_inst' after use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27042 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
