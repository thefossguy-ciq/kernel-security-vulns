Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7925e: fix use-after-free in free_irq()

>From commit a304e1b82808 ("[PATCH] Debug shared irqs"), there is a test
to make sure the shared irq handler should be able to handle the unexpected
event after deregistration. For this case, let's apply MT76_REMOVED flag to
indicate the device was removed and do not run into the resource access
anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
