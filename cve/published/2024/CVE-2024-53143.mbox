Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement

Ensure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput().
Holding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the
superblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping the
watched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before the
watched_objects decrement.
This can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs, but the
UAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanks
to the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().

Also, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call
fsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been
freed, which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53143 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45a8f8232a495221ed058191629f5c628f21601a
