Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix not checking skb length on hci_acldata_packet

This fixes not checking if skb really contains an ACL header otherwise
the code may attempt to access some uninitilized/invalid memory past the
valid skb->data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56590 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
