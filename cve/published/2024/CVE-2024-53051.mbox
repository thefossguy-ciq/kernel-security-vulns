Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/hdcp: Add encoder check in intel_hdcp_get_capability

Sometimes during hotplug scenario or suspend/resume scenario encoder is
not always initialized when intel_hdcp_get_capability add
a check to avoid kernel null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53051 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.11.7 with commit 4912e8fb3c37
	Fixed in 6.12 with commit 31b42af516af

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-53051
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/i915/display/intel_hdcp.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
