Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: Clean up TPM space after command failure

tpm_dev_transmit prepares the TPM space before attempting command
transmission. However if the command fails no rollback of this
preparation is done. This can result in transient handles being leaked
if the device is subsequently closed with no further commands performed.

Fix this by flushing the space in the event of command transmission
failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49851 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
