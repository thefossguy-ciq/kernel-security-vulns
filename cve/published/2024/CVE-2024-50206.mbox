Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix memory corruption during fq dma init

The loop responsible for allocating up to MTK_FQ_DMA_LENGTH buffers must
only touch as many descriptors, otherwise it ends up corrupting unrelated
memory. Fix the loop iteration count accordingly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50206 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68cd084e3ec1512cd383cb3e9cf0ab7ab413724c
