In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix double free of the ha->vp_map pointer

Coverity scan reported potential risk of double free of the pointer
ha->vp_map.  ha->vp_map was freed in qla2x00_mem_alloc(), and again freed
in function qla2x00_mem_free(ha).

Assign NULL to vp_map and kfree take care of NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
