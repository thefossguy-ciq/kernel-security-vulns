Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: add check read-only before txBeginAnon() call

Added a read-only check before calling `txBeginAnon` in `extAlloc`
and `extRecord`. This prevents modification attempts on a read-only
mounted filesystem, avoiding potential errors or crashes.

Call trace:
 txBeginAnon+0xac/0x154
 extAlloc+0xe8/0xdec fs/jfs/jfs_extent.c:78
 jfs_get_block+0x340/0xb98 fs/jfs/inode.c:248

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58095 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/15469c408af2d7a52fb186a92f2f091b0f13b1fb
