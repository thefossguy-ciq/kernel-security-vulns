Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: core: Prevent USB core invalid event buffer address access

This commit addresses an issue where the USB core could access an
invalid event buffer address during runtime suspend, potentially causing
SMMU faults and other memory issues in Exynos platforms. The problem
arises from the following sequence.
        1. In dwc3_gadget_suspend, there is a chance of a timeout when
        moving the USB core to the halt state after clearing the
        run/stop bit by software.
        2. In dwc3_core_exit, the event buffer is cleared regardless of
        the USB core's status, which may lead to an SMMU faults and
        other memory issues. if the USB core tries to access the event
        buffer address.

To prevent this hardware quirk on Exynos platforms, this commit ensures
that the event buffer address is not cleared by software  when the USB
core is active during runtime suspend by checking its status before
clearing the buffer address.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46675 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
