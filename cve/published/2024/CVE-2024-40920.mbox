Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: mst: fix suspicious rcu usage in br_mst_set_state

I converted br_mst_set_state to RCU to avoid a vlan use-after-free
but forgot to change the vlan group dereference helper. Switch to vlan
group RCU deref helper to fix the suspicious rcu usage warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40920 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
