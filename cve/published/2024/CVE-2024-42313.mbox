Subject: CVE-2024-42313: media: venus: fix use after free in vdec_close

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: fix use after free in vdec_close

There appears to be a possible use after free with vdec_close().
The firmware will add buffer release work to the work queue through
HFI callbacks as a normal part of decoding. Randomly closing the
decoder device from userspace during normal decoding can incur
a read after free for inst.

Fix it by cancelling the work in vdec_close.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42313 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
