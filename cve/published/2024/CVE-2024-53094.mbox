Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Add sendpage_ok() check to disable MSG_SPLICE_PAGES

While running ISER over SIW, the initiator machine encounters a warning
from skb_splice_from_iter() indicating that a slab page is being used in
send_page. To address this, it is better to add a sendpage_ok() check
within the driver itself, and if it returns 0, then MSG_SPLICE_PAGES flag
should be disabled before entering the network stack.

A similar issue has been discussed for NVMe in this thread:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
