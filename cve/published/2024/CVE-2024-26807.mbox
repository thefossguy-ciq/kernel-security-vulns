Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: cadence-qspi: fix pointer reference in runtime PM hooks

dev_get_drvdata() gets used to acquire the pointer to cqspi and the SPI
controller. Neither embed the other; this lead to memory corruption.

On a given platform (Mobileye EyeQ5) the memory corruption is hidden
inside cqspi->f_pdata. Also, this uninitialised memory is used as a
mutex (ctlr->bus_lock_mutex) by spi_controller_suspend().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26807 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
