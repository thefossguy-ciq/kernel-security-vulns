Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kobject_uevent: Fix OOB access within zap_modalias_env()

zap_modalias_env() wrongly calculates size of memory block to move, so
will cause OOB memory access issue if variable MODALIAS is not the last
one within its @env parameter, fixed by correcting size to memmove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42292 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
