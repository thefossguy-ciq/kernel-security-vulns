Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid dividing by 0 in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() when block bitmap corrupt

Determine if bb_fragments is 0 instead of determining bb_free to eliminate
the risk of dividing by zero when the block bitmap is corrupted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
