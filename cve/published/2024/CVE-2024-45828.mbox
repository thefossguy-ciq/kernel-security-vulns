Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Mask ring interrupts before ring stop request

Bus cleanup path in DMA mode may trigger a RING_OP_STAT interrupt when
the ring is being stopped. Depending on timing between ring stop request
completion, interrupt handler removal and code execution this may lead
to a NULL pointer dereference in hci_dma_irq_handler() if it gets to run
after the io_data pointer is set to NULL in hci_dma_cleanup().

Prevent this my masking the ring interrupts before ring stop request.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
