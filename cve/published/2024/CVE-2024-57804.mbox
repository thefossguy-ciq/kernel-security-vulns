Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix corrupt config pages PHY state is switched in sysfs

The driver, through the SAS transport, exposes a sysfs interface to
enable/disable PHYs in a controller/expander setup.  When multiple PHYs
are disabled and enabled in rapid succession, the persistent and current
config pages related to SAS IO unit/SAS Expander pages could get
corrupted.

Use separate memory for each config request.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57804 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.8 with commit 869fdc6f0606060301aef648231e186c7c542f5a
	Fixed in 6.13-rc2 with commit 711201a8b8334a397440ac0b859df0054e174bc9

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-57804
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/scsi/mpi3mr/mpi3mr.h
	drivers/scsi/mpi3mr/mpi3mr_fw.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/869fdc6f0606060301aef648231e186c7c542f5a
