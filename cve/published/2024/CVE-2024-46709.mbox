Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix prime with external buffers

Make sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the dma_buf
interface instead of trying to access pages directly.

External buffers might not provide direct access to readable/writable
pages so to make sure the bo's created from external dma_bufs can be
read dma_buf interface has to be used.

Fixes crashes in IGT's kms_prime with vgem. Regular desktop usage won't
trigger this due to the fact that virtual machines will not have
multiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46709 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
