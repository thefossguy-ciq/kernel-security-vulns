Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data

Memory for the "checksums" pointer will leak if the data is rechecked
after checksum failure (because the associated kfree won't happen due
to 'goto skip_io').

Fix this by freeing the checksums memory before recheck, and just use
the "checksum_onstack" memory for storing checksum during recheck.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26860 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
