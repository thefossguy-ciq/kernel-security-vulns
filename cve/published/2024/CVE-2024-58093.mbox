Subject: CVE-2024-58093: PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/ASPM: Fix link state exit during switch upstream function removal

Before 456d8aa37d0f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to
avoid use-after-free"), we would free the ASPM link only after the last
function on the bus pertaining to the given link was removed.

That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function,
link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.

After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function
removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.

That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream
port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which
still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because
pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

On that switch, function 0 is the virtual P2P bridge to the internal bus.
Free exactly when function 0 is removed -- before the parent link is
obsolete, but after all subordinate links are gone.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
