Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: take ownership of skb in mctp_local_output

Currently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of skb on success, and
we may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the
skb ownership isn't transferred until the actual output routing occurs.

Instead, make mctp_local_output free the skb on all error paths up to
the route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27418 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
