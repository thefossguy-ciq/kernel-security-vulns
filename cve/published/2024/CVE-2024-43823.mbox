Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: keystone: Fix NULL pointer dereference in case of DT error in ks_pcie_setup_rc_app_regs()

If IORESOURCE_MEM is not provided in Device Tree due to
any error, resource_list_first_type() will return NULL and
pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges() will just emit a warning.

This will cause a NULL pointer dereference. Fix this bug by adding NULL
return check.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43823 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
