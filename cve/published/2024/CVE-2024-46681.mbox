Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pktgen: use cpus_read_lock() in pg_net_init()

I have seen the WARN_ON(smp_processor_id() != cpu) firing
in pktgen_thread_worker() during tests.

We must use cpus_read_lock()/cpus_read_unlock()
around the for_each_online_cpu(cpu) loop.

While we are at it use WARN_ON_ONCE() to avoid a possible syslog flood.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46681 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 2.6.12 with commit 1da177e4c3f4 and fixed in 6.10.8 with commit 5f5f7366dda8

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/core/pktgen.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f5f7366dda8ae870e8305d6e7b3c0c2686cd2cf
