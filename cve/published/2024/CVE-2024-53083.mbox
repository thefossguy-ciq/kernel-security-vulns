Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: qcom-pmic: init value of hdr_len/txbuf_len earlier

If the read of USB_PDPHY_RX_ACKNOWLEDGE_REG failed, then hdr_len and
txbuf_len are uninitialized. This commit stops to print uninitialized
value and misleading/false data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53083 to this issue.

	drivers/usb/typec/tcpm/qcom/qcom_pmic_typec_pdphy.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
