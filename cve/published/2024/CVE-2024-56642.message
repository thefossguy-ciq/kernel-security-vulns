When bearer_disable() calls tipc_udp_disable(), cleanup
of the UDP kernel socket is deferred by work calling
cleanup_bearer().

tipc_exit_net() waits for such works to finish by checking
tipc_net(net)->wq_count.  However, the work decrements the
count too early before releasing the kernel socket,
unblocking cleanup_net() and resulting in use-after-free.
