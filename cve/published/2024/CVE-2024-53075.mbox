Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Prevent a bad reference count on CPU nodes

When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node
at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a
specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for
the node that was acquired.

Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we
can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and
we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.
This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.

Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring
the device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/303846a3dc275e35fbb556d72f1e356ba669e4f8
