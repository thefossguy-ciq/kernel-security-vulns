Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: marvell: prestera: fix NULL dereference on devlink_alloc() failure

devlink_alloc() may return NULL on allocation failure, but
prestera_devlink_alloc() unconditionally calls devlink_priv() on
the returned pointer.

This leads to a NULL pointer dereference if devlink allocation fails.
Add a check for a NULL devlink pointer and return NULL early to avoid
the crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23019 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
