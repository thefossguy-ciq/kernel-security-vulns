Subject: CVE-2026-23194: rust_binder: correctly handle FDA objects of length zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rust_binder: correctly handle FDA objects of length zero

Fix a bug where an empty FDA (fd array) object with 0 fds would cause an
out-of-bounds error. The previous implementation used `skip == 0` to
mean "this is a pointer fixup", but 0 is also the correct skip length
for an empty FDA. If the FDA is at the end of the buffer, then this
results in an attempt to write 8-bytes out of bounds. This is caught and
results in an EINVAL error being returned to userspace.

The pattern of using `skip == 0` as a special value originates from the
C-implementation of Binder. As part of fixing this bug, this pattern is
replaced with a Rust enum.

I considered the alternate option of not pushing a fixup when the length
is zero, but I think it's cleaner to just get rid of the zero-is-special
stuff.

The root cause of this bug was diagnosed by Gemini CLI on first try. I
used the following prompt:

> There appears to be a bug in @drivers/android/binder/thread.rs where
> the Fixups oob bug is triggered with 316 304 316 324. This implies
> that we somehow ended up with a fixup where buffer A has a pointer to
> buffer B, but the pointer is located at an index in buffer A that is
> out of bounds. Please investigate the code to find the bug. You may
> compare with @drivers/android/binder.c that implements this correctly.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/598fe3ff32e43918ed8a062f55432b3d23e6340c
