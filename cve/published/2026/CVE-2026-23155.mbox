Subject: CVE-2026-23155: can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix error message

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix error message

Sinc commit 79a6d1bfe114 ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback():
unanchor URL on usb_submit_urb() error") a failing resubmit URB will print
an info message.

In the case of a short read where netdev has not yet been assigned,
initialize as NULL to avoid dereferencing an undefined value. Also report
the error value of the failed resubmit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23155 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
