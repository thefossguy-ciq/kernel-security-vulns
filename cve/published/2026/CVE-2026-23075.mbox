Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: esd_usb: esd_usb_read_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak

Fix similar memory leak as in commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb:
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix URB memory leak").

In esd_usb_open(), the URBs for USB-in transfers are allocated, added to
the dev->rx_submitted anchor and submitted. In the complete callback
esd_usb_read_bulk_callback(), the URBs are processed and resubmitted. In
esd_usb_close() the URBs are freed by calling
usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&dev->rx_submitted).

However, this does not take into account that the USB framework unanchors
the URB before the complete function is called. This means that once an
in-URB has been completed, it is no longer anchored and is ultimately not
released in esd_usb_close().

Fix the memory leak by anchoring the URB in the
esd_usb_read_bulk_callback() to the dev->rx_submitted anchor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
