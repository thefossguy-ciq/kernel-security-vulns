Subject: CVE-2026-23044: PM: hibernate: Fix crash when freeing invalid crypto compressor

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM: hibernate: Fix crash when freeing invalid crypto compressor

When crypto_alloc_acomp() fails, it returns an ERR_PTR value, not NULL.

The cleanup code in save_compressed_image() and load_compressed_image()
unconditionally calls crypto_free_acomp() without checking for ERR_PTR,
which causes crypto_acomp_tfm() to dereference an invalid pointer and
crash the kernel.

This can be triggered when the compression algorithm is unavailable
(e.g., CONFIG_CRYPTO_LZO not enabled).

Fix by adding IS_ERR_OR_NULL() checks before calling crypto_free_acomp()
and acomp_request_free(), similar to the existing kthread_stop() check.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b7a883b0135dbc6817e90a829421c9fc8cd94bad
