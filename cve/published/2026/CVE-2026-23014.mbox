Subject: CVE-2026-23014: perf: Ensure swevent hrtimer is properly destroyed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Ensure swevent hrtimer is properly destroyed

With the change to hrtimer_try_to_cancel() in
perf_swevent_cancel_hrtimer() it appears possible for the hrtimer to
still be active by the time the event gets freed.

Make sure the event does a full hrtimer_cancel() on the free path by
installing a perf_event::destroy handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23014 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
