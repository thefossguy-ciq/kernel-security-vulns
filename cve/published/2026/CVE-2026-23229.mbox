Subject: CVE-2026-23229: crypto: virtio - Add spinlock protection with virtqueue notification

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: virtio - Add spinlock protection with virtqueue notification

When VM boots with one virtio-crypto PCI device and builtin backend,
run openssl benchmark command with multiple processes, such as
  openssl speed -evp aes-128-cbc -engine afalg  -seconds 10 -multi 32

openssl processes will hangup and there is error reported like this:
 virtio_crypto virtio0: dataq.0:id 3 is not a head!

It seems that the data virtqueue need protection when it is handled
for virtio done notification. If the spinlock protection is added
in virtcrypto_done_task(), openssl benchmark with multiple processes
works well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23229 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
