Subject: CVE-2026-23221: bus: fsl-mc: fix use-after-free in driver_override_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: fsl-mc: fix use-after-free in driver_override_show()

The driver_override_show() function reads the driver_override string
without holding the device_lock. However, driver_override_store() uses
driver_set_override(), which modifies and frees the string while holding
the device_lock.

This can result in a concurrent use-after-free if the string is freed
by the store function while being read by the show function.

Fix this by holding the device_lock around the read operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23221 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
