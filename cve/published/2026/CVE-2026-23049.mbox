Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panel-simple: fix connector type for DataImage SCF0700C48GGU18 panel

The connector type for the DataImage SCF0700C48GGU18 panel is missing and
devm_drm_panel_bridge_add() requires connector type to be set. This leads
to a warning and a backtrace in the kernel log and panel does not work:
"
WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 38 at drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/panel.c:379 devm_drm_of_get_bridge+0xac/0xb8
"
The warning is triggered by a check for valid connector type in
devm_drm_panel_bridge_add(). If there is no valid connector type
set for a panel, the warning is printed and panel is not added.
Fill in the missing connector type to fix the warning and make
the panel operational once again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
