Subject: CVE-2026-23072: l2tp: Fix memleak in l2tp_udp_encap_recv().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

l2tp: Fix memleak in l2tp_udp_encap_recv().

syzbot reported memleak of struct l2tp_session, l2tp_tunnel,
sock, etc. [0]

The cited commit moved down the validation of the protocol
version in l2tp_udp_encap_recv().

The new place requires an extra error handling to avoid the
memleak.

Let's call l2tp_session_put() there.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
