Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer in tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer

The curr_xfer field is read by the IRQ handler without holding the lock
to check if a transfer is in progress. When clearing curr_xfer in the
combined sequence transfer loop, protect it with the spinlock to prevent
a race with the interrupt handler.

Protect the curr_xfer clearing at the exit path of
tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer() with the spinlock to prevent a race
with the interrupt handler that reads this field.

Without this protection, the IRQ handler could read a partially updated
curr_xfer value, leading to NULL pointer dereference or use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
