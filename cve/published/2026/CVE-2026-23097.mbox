Subject: CVE-2026-23097: migrate: correct lock ordering for hugetlb file folios

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

migrate: correct lock ordering for hugetlb file folios

Syzbot has found a deadlock (analyzed by Lance Yang):

1) Task (5749): Holds folio_lock, then tries to acquire i_mmap_rwsem(read lock).
2) Task (5754): Holds i_mmap_rwsem(write lock), then tries to acquire
folio_lock.

migrate_pages()
  -> migrate_hugetlbs()
    -> unmap_and_move_huge_page()     <- Takes folio_lock!
      -> remove_migration_ptes()
        -> __rmap_walk_file()
          -> i_mmap_lock_read()       <- Waits for i_mmap_rwsem(read lock)!

hugetlbfs_fallocate()
  -> hugetlbfs_punch_hole()           <- Takes i_mmap_rwsem(write lock)!
    -> hugetlbfs_zero_partial_page()
     -> filemap_lock_hugetlb_folio()
      -> filemap_lock_folio()
        -> __filemap_get_folio        <- Waits for folio_lock!

The migration path is the one taking locks in the wrong order according to
the documentation at the top of mm/rmap.c.  So expand the scope of the
existing i_mmap_lock to cover the calls to remove_migration_ptes() too.

This is (mostly) how it used to be after commit c0d0381ade79.  That was
removed by 336bf30eb765 for both file & anon hugetlb pages when it should
only have been removed for anon hugetlb pages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23097 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
