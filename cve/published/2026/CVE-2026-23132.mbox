Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: synopsys: dw-dp: fix error paths of dw_dp_bind

Fix several issues in dw_dp_bind() error handling:

1. Missing return after drm_bridge_attach() failure - the function
   continued execution instead of returning an error.

2. Resource leak: drm_dp_aux_register() is not a devm function, so
   drm_dp_aux_unregister() must be called on all error paths after
   aux registration succeeds. This affects errors from:
   - drm_bridge_attach()
   - phy_init()
   - devm_add_action_or_reset()
   - platform_get_irq()
   - devm_request_threaded_irq()

3. Bug fix: platform_get_irq() returns the IRQ number or a negative
   error code, but the error path was returning ERR_PTR(ret) instead
   of ERR_PTR(dp->irq).

Use a goto label for cleanup to ensure consistent error handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/569ed6a73e927a34cae4ae6de1464c0737a5ec44
