Subject: CVE-2026-23054: net: hv_netvsc: reject RSS hash key programming without RX indirection table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hv_netvsc: reject RSS hash key programming without RX indirection table

RSS configuration requires a valid RX indirection table. When the device
reports a single receive queue, rndis_filter_device_add() does not
allocate an indirection table, accepting RSS hash key updates in this
state leads to a hang.

Fix this by gating netvsc_set_rxfh() on ndc->rx_table_sz and return
-EOPNOTSUPP when the table is absent. This aligns set_rxfh with the device
capabilities and prevents incorrect behavior.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23054 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
