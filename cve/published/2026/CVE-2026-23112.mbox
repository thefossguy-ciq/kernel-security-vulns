Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-tcp: add bounds checks in nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec

nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() could walk past cmd->req.sg when a PDU
length or offset exceeds sg_cnt and then use bogus sg->length/offset
values, leading to _copy_to_iter() GPF/KASAN. Guard sg_idx, remaining
entries, and sg->length/offset before building the bvec.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
