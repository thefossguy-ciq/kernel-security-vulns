Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fou: Don't allow 0 for FOU_ATTR_IPPROTO.

fou_udp_recv() has the same problem mentioned in the previous
patch.

If FOU_ATTR_IPPROTO is set to 0, skb is not freed by
fou_udp_recv() nor "resubmit"-ted in ip_protocol_deliver_rcu().

Let's forbid 0 for FOU_ATTR_IPPROTO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
