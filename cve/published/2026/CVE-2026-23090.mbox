Subject: CVE-2026-23090: slimbus: core: fix device reference leak on report present

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slimbus: core: fix device reference leak on report present

Slimbus devices can be allocated dynamically upon reception of
report-present messages.

Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking up already registered
devices.

Note that this requires taking an extra reference in case the device has
not yet been registered and has to be allocated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23090 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
