Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: can: j1939: j1939_xtp_rx_rts_session_active(): deactivate session upon receiving the second rts

Since j1939_session_deactivate_activate_next() in j1939_tp_rxtimer() is
called only when the timer is enabled, we need to call
j1939_session_deactivate_activate_next() if we cancelled the timer.
Otherwise, refcount for j1939_session leaks, which will later appear as

| unregister_netdevice: waiting for vcan0 to become free. Usage count = 2.

problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
