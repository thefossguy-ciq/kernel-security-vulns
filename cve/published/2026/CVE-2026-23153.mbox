Subject: CVE-2026-23153: firewire: core: fix race condition against transaction list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firewire: core: fix race condition against transaction list

The list of transaction is enumerated without acquiring card lock when
processing AR response event. This causes a race condition bug when
processing AT request completion event concurrently.

This commit fixes the bug by put timer start for split transaction
expiration into the scope of lock. The value of jiffies in card structure
is referred before acquiring the lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
