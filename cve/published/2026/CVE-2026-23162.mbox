Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/nvm: Fix double-free on aux add failure

After a successful auxiliary_device_init(), aux_dev->dev.release
(xe_nvm_release_dev()) is responsible for the kfree(nvm). When
there is failure with auxiliary_device_add(), driver will call
auxiliary_device_uninit(), which call put_device(). So that the
.release callback will be triggered to free the memory associated
with the auxiliary_device.

Move the kfree(nvm) into the auxiliary_device_init() failure path
and remove the err goto path to fix below error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/32887d8e4bc0696b3cb6c5915a42b39cfd3434f4
