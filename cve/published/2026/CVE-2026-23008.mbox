Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix KMS with 3D on HW version 10

HW version 10 does not have GB Surfaces so there is no backing buffer for
surface backed FBs. This would result in a nullptr dereference and crash
the driver causing a black screen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23008 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a91bdd21d5efb3072beefbec13762b7722200c49
