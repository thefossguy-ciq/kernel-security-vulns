Subject: CVE-2026-22995: ublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix use-after-free in ublk_partition_scan_work

A race condition exists between the async partition scan work and device
teardown that can lead to a use-after-free of ub->ub_disk:

1. ublk_ctrl_start_dev() schedules partition_scan_work after add_disk()
2. ublk_stop_dev() calls ublk_stop_dev_unlocked() which does:
   - del_gendisk(ub->ub_disk)
   - ublk_detach_disk() sets ub->ub_disk = NULL
   - put_disk() which may free the disk
3. The worker ublk_partition_scan_work() then dereferences ub->ub_disk
   leading to UAF

Fix this by using ublk_get_disk()/ublk_put_disk() in the worker to hold
a reference to the disk during the partition scan. The spinlock in
ublk_get_disk() synchronizes with ublk_detach_disk() ensuring the worker
either gets a valid reference or sees NULL and exits early.

Also change flush_work() to cancel_work_sync() to avoid running the
partition scan work unnecessarily when the disk is already detached.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22995 to this issue.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
