Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: cls_u32: use skb_header_pointer_careful()

skb_header_pointer() does not fully validate negative @offset values.

Use skb_header_pointer_careful() instead.

GangMin Kim provided a report and a repro fooling u32_classify():

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in u32_classify+0x1180/0x11b0
net/sched/cls_u32.c:221

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23204 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
