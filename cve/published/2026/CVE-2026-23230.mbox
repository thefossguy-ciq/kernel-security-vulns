Subject: CVE-2026-23230: smb: client: split cached_fid bitfields to avoid shared-byte RMW races

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: split cached_fid bitfields to avoid shared-byte RMW races

is_open, has_lease and on_list are stored in the same bitfield byte in
struct cached_fid but are updated in different code paths that may run
concurrently. Bitfield assignments generate byte read–modify–write
operations (e.g. `orb $mask, addr` on x86_64), so updating one flag can
restore stale values of the others.

A possible interleaving is:
    CPU1: load old byte (has_lease=1, on_list=1)
    CPU2: clear both flags (store 0)
    CPU1: RMW store (old | IS_OPEN) -> reintroduces cleared bits

To avoid this class of races, convert these flags to separate bool
fields.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23230 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
