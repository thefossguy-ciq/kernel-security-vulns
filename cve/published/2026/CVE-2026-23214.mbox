Subject: CVE-2026-23214: btrfs: reject new transactions if the fs is fully read-only

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: reject new transactions if the fs is fully read-only

[BUG]
There is a bug report where a heavily fuzzed fs is mounted with all
rescue mount options, which leads to the following warnings during
unmount:

  BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -22)

Since rescue mount options will mark the full fs read-only, there should
be no new transaction triggered.

But during unmount we will evict all inodes, which can trigger a new
transaction, and triggers warnings on a heavily corrupted fs.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs allows new transaction even on a read-only fs, this is to allow
log replay happen even on read-only mounts, just like what ext4/xfs do.

However with rescue mount options, the fs is fully read-only and cannot
be remounted read-write, thus in that case we should also reject any new
transactions.

[FIX]
If we find the fs has rescue mount options, we should treat the fs as
error, so that no new transaction can be started.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23214 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
