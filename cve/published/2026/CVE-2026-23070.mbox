Subject: CVE-2026-23070: Octeontx2-af: Add proper checks for fwdata

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Octeontx2-af: Add proper checks for fwdata

firmware populates MAC address, link modes (supported, advertised)
and EEPROM data in shared firmware structure which kernel access
via MAC block(CGX/RPM).

Accessing fwdata, on boards booted with out MAC block leading to
kernel panics.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
