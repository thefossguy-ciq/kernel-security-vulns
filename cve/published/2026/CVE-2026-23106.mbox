Subject: CVE-2026-23106: timekeeping: Adjust the leap state for the correct auxiliary timekeeper

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

timekeeping: Adjust the leap state for the correct auxiliary timekeeper

When __do_ajdtimex() was introduced to handle adjtimex for any
timekeeper, this reference to tk_core was not updated. When called on an
auxiliary timekeeper, the core timekeeper would be updated incorrectly.

This gets caught by the lock debugging diagnostics because the
timekeepers sequence lock gets written to without holding its
associated spinlock:

WARNING: include/linux/seqlock.h:226 at __do_adjtimex+0x394/0x3b0, CPU#2: test/125
aux_clock_adj (kernel/time/timekeeping.c:2979)
__do_sys_clock_adjtime (kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1161 kernel/time/posix-timers.c:1173)

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:131)

Update the correct auxiliary timekeeper.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
