Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: Fix memory leak in octep_device_setup()

In octep_device_setup(), if octep_ctrl_net_init() fails, the function
returns directly without unmapping the mapped resources and freeing the
allocated configuration memory.

Fix this by jumping to the unsupported_dev label, which performs the
necessary cleanup. This aligns with the error handling logic of other
paths in this function.

Compile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool
and code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23160 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
