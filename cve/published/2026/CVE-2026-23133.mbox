Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath10k: fix dma_free_coherent() pointer

dma_alloc_coherent() allocates a DMA mapped buffer and stores the
addresses in XXX_unaligned fields.  Those should be reused when freeing
the buffer rather than the aligned addresses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23133 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
