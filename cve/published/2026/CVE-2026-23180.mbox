Subject: CVE-2026-23180: dpaa2-switch: add bounds check for if_id in IRQ handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dpaa2-switch: add bounds check for if_id in IRQ handler

The IRQ handler extracts if_id from the upper 16 bits of the hardware
status register and uses it to index into ethsw->ports[] without
validation. Since if_id can be any 16-bit value (0-65535) but the ports
array is only allocated with sw_attr.num_ifs elements, this can lead to
an out-of-bounds read potentially.

Add a bounds check before accessing the array, consistent with the
existing validation in dpaa2_switch_rx().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23180 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
