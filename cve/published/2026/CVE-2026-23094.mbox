Subject: CVE-2026-23094: uacce: fix isolate sysfs check condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: fix isolate sysfs check condition

uacce supports the device isolation feature. If the driver
implements the isolate_err_threshold_read and
isolate_err_threshold_write callback functions, uacce will create
sysfs files now. Users can read and configure the isolation policy
through sysfs. Currently, sysfs files are created as long as either
isolate_err_threshold_read or isolate_err_threshold_write callback
functions are present.

However, accessing a non-existent callback function may cause the
system to crash. Therefore, intercept the creation of sysfs if
neither read nor write exists; create sysfs if either is supported,
but intercept unsupported operations at the call site.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
