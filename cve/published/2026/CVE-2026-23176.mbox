Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: toshiba_haps: Fix memory leaks in add/remove routines

toshiba_haps_add() leaks the haps object allocated by it if it returns
an error after allocating that object successfully.

toshiba_haps_remove() does not free the object pointed to by
toshiba_haps before clearing that pointer, so it becomes unreachable
allocated memory.

Address these memory leaks by using devm_kzalloc() for allocating
the memory in question.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
