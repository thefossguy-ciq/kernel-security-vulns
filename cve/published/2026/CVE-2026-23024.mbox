Subject: CVE-2026-23024: idpf: fix memory leak of flow steer list on rmmod

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: fix memory leak of flow steer list on rmmod

The flow steering list maintains entries that are added and removed as
ethtool creates and deletes flow steering rules. Module removal with active
entries causes memory leak as the list is not properly cleaned up.

Prevent this by iterating through the remaining entries in the list and
freeing the associated memory during module removal. Add a spinlock
(flow_steer_list_lock) to protect the list access from multiple threads.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23024 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
