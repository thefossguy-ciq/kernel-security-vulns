EROFS may encounter above panic when enabling file-backed mount w/
directio mount option, the root cause is it may suffer UAF in below
race condition:

- z_erofs_read_folio                          wq s_dio_done_wq
 - z_erofs_runqueue
  - erofs_fileio_submit_bio
   - erofs_fileio_rq_submit
    - vfs_iocb_iter_read
     - ext4_file_read_iter
      - ext4_dio_read_iter
       - iomap_dio_rw
       : bio was submitted and return -EIOCBQUEUED
                                              - dio_aio_complete_work
                                               - dio_complete
                                                - dio->iocb->ki_complete (erofs_fileio_ki_complete())
                                                 - kfree(rq)
                                                 : it frees iocb, iocb.ki_filp can be UAF in file_accessed().
       - file_accessed
       : access NULL file point

Introduce a reference count in struct erofs_fileio_rq, and initialize it
as two, both erofs_fileio_ki_complete() and erofs_fileio_rq_submit() will
decrease reference count, the last one decreasing the reference count
to zero will free rq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23224 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
