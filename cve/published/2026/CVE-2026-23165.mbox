Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: fix deadlock in RSS config read

Since cited commit, core locks the net_device's rss_lock when handling
 ethtool -x command, so driver's implementation should not lock it
 again.  Remove the latter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23165 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/590c8179ffb01c17644181408821b55b8704c50c
