Subject: CVE-2026-23062: platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kernel panic in GET_INSTANCE_ID macro

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kernel panic in GET_INSTANCE_ID macro

The GET_INSTANCE_ID macro that caused a kernel panic when accessing sysfs
attributes:

1. Off-by-one error: The loop condition used '<=' instead of '<',
   causing access beyond array bounds. Since array indices are 0-based
   and go from 0 to instances_count-1, the loop should use '<'.

2. Missing NULL check: The code dereferenced attr_name_kobj->name
   without checking if attr_name_kobj was NULL, causing a null pointer
   dereference in min_length_show() and other attribute show functions.

The panic occurred when fwupd tried to read BIOS configuration attributes:

  Oops: general protection fault [#1] SMP KASAN NOPTI
  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]
  RIP: 0010:min_length_show+0xcf/0x1d0 [hp_bioscfg]

Add a NULL check for attr_name_kobj before dereferencing and corrects
the loop boundary to match the pattern used elsewhere in the driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23062 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
