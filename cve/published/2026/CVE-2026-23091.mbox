Subject: CVE-2026-23091: intel_th: fix device leak on output open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

intel_th: fix device leak on output open()

Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking up the th device
during output device open() on errors and on close().

Note that a recent commit fixed the leak in a couple of open() error
paths but not all of them, and the reference is still leaking on
successful open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23091 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
