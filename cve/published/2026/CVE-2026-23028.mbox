Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_ipi_destroy()

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_ipi_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23028 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.18.7 with commit 5defcc2f9c22e6e09b5be68234ad10f4ba0292b7

	arch/loongarch/kvm/intc/ipi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5defcc2f9c22e6e09b5be68234ad10f4ba0292b7
