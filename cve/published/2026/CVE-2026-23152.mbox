Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: correctly decode TTLM with default link map

TID-To-Link Mapping (TTLM) elements do not contain any link mapping
presence indicator if a default mapping is used and parsing needs to be
skipped.

Note that access points should not explicitly report an advertised TTLM
with a default mapping as that is the implied mapping if the element is
not included, this is even the case when switching back to the default
mapping. However, mac80211 would incorrectly parse the frame and would
also read one byte beyond the end of the element.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23152 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aabc36857bd39da65fe2d047bfaf63a0a09917d4
