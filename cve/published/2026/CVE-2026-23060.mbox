Subject: CVE-2026-23060: crypto: authencesn - reject too-short AAD (assoclen<8) to match ESP/ESN spec

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: authencesn - reject too-short AAD (assoclen<8) to match ESP/ESN spec

authencesn assumes an ESP/ESN-formatted AAD. When assoclen is shorter than
the minimum expected length, crypto_authenc_esn_decrypt() can advance past
the end of the destination scatterlist and trigger a NULL pointer dereference
in scatterwalk_map_and_copy(), leading to a kernel panic (DoS).

Add a minimum AAD length check to fail fast on invalid inputs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23060 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
