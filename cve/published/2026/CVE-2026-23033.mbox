Subject: CVE-2026-23033: dmaengine: omap-dma: fix dma_pool resource leak in error paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: omap-dma: fix dma_pool resource leak in error paths

The dma_pool created by dma_pool_create() is not destroyed when
dma_async_device_register() or of_dma_controller_register() fails,
causing a resource leak in the probe error paths.

Add dma_pool_destroy() in both error paths to properly release the
allocated dma_pool resource.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23033 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
