Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: add missing ice_deinit_hw() in devlink reinit path

devlink-reload results in ice_init_hw failed error, and then removing
the ice driver causes a NULL pointer dereference.

[  +0.102213] ice 0000:ca:00.0: ice_init_hw failed: -16
...
[  +0.000001] Call Trace:
[  +0.000003]  <TASK>
[  +0.000006]  ice_unload+0x8f/0x100 [ice]
[  +0.000081]  ice_remove+0xba/0x300 [ice]

Commit 1390b8b3d2be ("ice: remove duplicate call to ice_deinit_hw() on
error paths") removed ice_deinit_hw() from ice_deinit_dev(). As a result
ice_devlink_reinit_down() no longer calls ice_deinit_hw(), but
ice_devlink_reinit_up() still calls ice_init_hw(). Since the control
queues are not uninitialized, ice_init_hw() fails with -EBUSY.

Add ice_deinit_hw() to ice_devlink_reinit_down() to correspond with
ice_init_hw() in ice_devlink_reinit_up().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23117 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ice/devlink/devlink.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3d99e2fbf01446d31a0d0dfc46444e915a1f6d4
