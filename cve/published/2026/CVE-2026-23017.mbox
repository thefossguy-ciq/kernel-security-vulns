Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: fix error handling in the init_task on load

If the init_task fails during a driver load, we end up without vports and
netdevs, effectively failing the entire process. In that state a
subsequent reset will result in a crash as the service task attempts to
access uninitialized resources. Following trace is from an error in the
init_task where the CREATE_VPORT (op 501) is rejected by the FW:

[40922.763136] idpf 0000:83:00.0: Device HW Reset initiated

Fix the error handling in the init_task to make sure the service and
mailbox tasks are disabled if the error happens during load. These are
started in idpf_vc_core_init(), which spawns the init_task and has no way
of knowing if it failed. If the error happens on reset, following
successful driver load, the tasks can still run, as that will allow the
netdevs to attempt recovery through another reset. Stop the PTP callbacks
either way as those will be restarted by the call to idpf_vc_core_init()
during a successful reset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a514c374edcd33581cdcccf8faa7cc606a600319
