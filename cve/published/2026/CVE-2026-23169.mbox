Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix race in mptcp_pm_nl_flush_addrs_doit()

syzbot and Eulgyu Kim reported crashes in mptcp_pm_nl_get_local_id()
and/or mptcp_pm_nl_is_backup()

Root cause is list_splice_init() in mptcp_pm_nl_flush_addrs_doit()
which is not RCU ready.

list_splice_init_rcu() can not be called here while holding pernet->lock
spinlock.

Many thanks to Eulgyu Kim for providing a repro and testing our patches.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23169 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f1b9523527df02685dde603f20ff6e603d8e4a1
