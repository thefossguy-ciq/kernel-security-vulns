Subject: CVE-2026-23038: pnfs/flexfiles: Fix memory leak in nfs4_ff_alloc_deviceid_node()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pnfs/flexfiles: Fix memory leak in nfs4_ff_alloc_deviceid_node()

In nfs4_ff_alloc_deviceid_node(), if the allocation for ds_versions fails,
the function jumps to the out_scratch label without freeing the already
allocated dsaddrs list, leading to a memory leak.

Fix this by jumping to the out_err_drain_dsaddrs label, which properly
frees the dsaddrs list before cleaning up other resources.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23038 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
