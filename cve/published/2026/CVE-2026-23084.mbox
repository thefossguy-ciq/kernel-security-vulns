Subject: CVE-2026-23084: be2net: Fix NULL pointer dereference in be_cmd_get_mac_from_list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

be2net: Fix NULL pointer dereference in be_cmd_get_mac_from_list

When the parameter pmac_id_valid argument of be_cmd_get_mac_from_list() is
set to false, the driver may request the PMAC_ID from the firmware of the
network card, and this function will store that PMAC_ID at the provided
address pmac_id. This is the contract of this function.

However, there is a location within the driver where both
pmac_id_valid == false and pmac_id == NULL are being passed. This could
result in dereferencing a NULL pointer.

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to pass the address of a stub
variable to the function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
