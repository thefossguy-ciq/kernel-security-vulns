Subject: CVE-2026-23116: pmdomain: imx8m-blk-ctrl: Remove separate rst and clk mask for 8mq vpu

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: imx8m-blk-ctrl: Remove separate rst and clk mask for 8mq vpu

For i.MX8MQ platform, the ADB in the VPUMIX domain has no separate reset
and clock enable bits, but is ungated and reset together with the VPUs.
So we can't reset G1 or G2 separately, it may led to the system hang.
Remove rst_mask and clk_mask of imx8mq_vpu_blk_ctl_domain_data.
Let imx8mq_vpu_power_notifier() do really vpu reset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23116 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
