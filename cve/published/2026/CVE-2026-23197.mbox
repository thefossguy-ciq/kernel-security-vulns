Subject: CVE-2026-23197: i2c: imx: preserve error state in block data length handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: imx: preserve error state in block data length handler

When a block read returns an invalid length, zero or >I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX,
the length handler sets the state to IMX_I2C_STATE_FAILED. However,
i2c_imx_master_isr() unconditionally overwrites this with
IMX_I2C_STATE_READ_CONTINUE, causing an endless read loop that overruns
buffers and crashes the system.

Guard the state transition to preserve error states set by the length
handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
