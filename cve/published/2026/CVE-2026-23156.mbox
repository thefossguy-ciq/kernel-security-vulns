Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efivarfs: fix error propagation in efivar_entry_get()

efivar_entry_get() always returns success even if the underlying
__efivar_entry_get() fails, masking errors.

This may result in uninitialized heap memory being copied to userspace
in the efivarfs_file_read() path.

Fix it by returning the error from __efivar_entry_get().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23156 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
