Subject: CVE-2026-23013: net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback

octep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue IRQs with dev_id set to
ioq_vector. If request_irq() fails part-way, the rollback loop calls
free_irq() with dev_id set to 'oct', which does not match the original
dev_id and may leave the irqaction registered.

This can keep IRQ handlers alive while ioq_vector is later freed during
unwind/teardown, leading to a use-after-free or crash when an interrupt
fires.

Fix the error path to free IRQs with the same ioq_vector dev_id used
during request_irq().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23013 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
