Subject: CVE-2026-23042: idpf: fix aux device unplugging when rdma is not supported by vport

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: fix aux device unplugging when rdma is not supported by vport

If vport flags do not contain VIRTCHNL2_VPORT_ENABLE_RDMA, driver does not
allocate vdev_info for this vport. This leads to kernel NULL pointer
dereference in idpf_idc_vport_dev_down(), which references vdev_info for
every vport regardless.

Check, if vdev_info was ever allocated before unplugging aux device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23042 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
