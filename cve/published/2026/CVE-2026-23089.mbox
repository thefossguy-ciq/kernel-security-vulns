Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix use-after-free in snd_usb_mixer_free()

When snd_usb_create_mixer() fails, snd_usb_mixer_free() frees
mixer->id_elems but the controls already added to the card still
reference the freed memory. Later when snd_card_register() runs,
the OSS mixer layer calls their callbacks and hits a use-after-free read.

Call trace:
  get_ctl_value+0x63f/0x820 sound/usb/mixer.c:411
  get_min_max_with_quirks.isra.0+0x240/0x1f40 sound/usb/mixer.c:1241
  mixer_ctl_feature_info+0x26b/0x490 sound/usb/mixer.c:1381
  snd_mixer_oss_build_test+0x174/0x3a0 sound/core/oss/mixer_oss.c:887

  snd_card_register+0x4ed/0x6d0 sound/core/init.c:923
  usb_audio_probe+0x5ef/0x2a90 sound/usb/card.c:1025

Fix by calling snd_ctl_remove() for all mixer controls before freeing
id_elems. We save the next pointer first because snd_ctl_remove()
frees the current element.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
