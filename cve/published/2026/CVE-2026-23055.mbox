Subject: CVE-2026-23055: i2c: riic: Move suspend handling to NOIRQ phase

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: riic: Move suspend handling to NOIRQ phase

Commit 53326135d0e0 ("i2c: riic: Add suspend/resume support") added
suspend support for the Renesas I2C driver and following this change
on RZ/G3E the following WARNING is seen on entering suspend ...

The warning is triggered because I2C transfers can still be attempted
while the controller is already suspended, due to inappropriate ordering
of the system sleep callbacks.

If the controller is autosuspended, there is no way to wake it up once
runtime PM disabled (in suspend_late()). During system resume, the I2C
controller will be available only after runtime PM is re-enabled
(in resume_early()). However, this may be too late for some devices.

Wake up the controller in the suspend() callback while runtime PM is
still enabled. The I2C controller will remain available until the
suspend_noirq() callback (pm_runtime_force_suspend()) is called. During
resume, the I2C controller can be restored by the resume_noirq() callback
(pm_runtime_force_resume()). Finally, the resume() callback re-enables
autosuspend. As a result, the I2C controller can remain available until
the system enters suspend_noirq() and from resume_noirq().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
