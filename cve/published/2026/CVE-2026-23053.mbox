Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix a deadlock involving nfs_release_folio()

Wang Zhaolong reports a deadlock involving NFSv4.1 state recovery
waiting on kthreadd, which is attempting to reclaim memory by calling
nfs_release_folio(). The latter cannot make progress due to state
recovery being needed.

It seems that the only safe thing to do here is to kick off a writeback
of the folio, without waiting for completion, or else kicking off an
asynchronous commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23053 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
