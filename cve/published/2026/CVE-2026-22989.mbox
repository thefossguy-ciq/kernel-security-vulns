Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: check that server is running in unlock_filesystem

If we are trying to unlock the filesystem via an administrative
interface and nfsd isn't running, it crashes the server. This
happens currently because nfsd4_revoke_states() access state
structures (eg., conf_id_hashtbl) that has been freed as a part
of the server shutdown.

[   59.469138]  el0t_64_sync+0x1ac/0x1b0

Ensure this can't happen by taking the nfsd_mutex and checking that
the server is still up, and then holding the mutex across the call to
nfsd4_revoke_states().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22989 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c
	fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c
	fs/nfsd/state.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d95499900fe52f3d461ed26b7a30bebea8f12914
