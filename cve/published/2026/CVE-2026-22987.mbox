Subject: CVE-2026-22987: net/sched: act_api: avoid dereferencing ERR_PTR in tcf_idrinfo_destroy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_api: avoid dereferencing ERR_PTR in tcf_idrinfo_destroy

syzbot reported a crash in tc_act_in_hw() during netns teardown where
tcf_idrinfo_destroy() passed an ERR_PTR(-EBUSY) value as a tc_action
pointer, leading to an invalid dereference.

Guard against ERR_PTR entries when iterating the action IDR so teardown
does not call tc_act_in_hw() on an error pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22987 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
