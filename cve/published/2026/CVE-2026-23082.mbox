Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): unanchor URL on usb_submit_urb() error

In commit 7352e1d5932a ("can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): fix
URB memory leak"), the URB was re-anchored before usb_submit_urb() in
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() to prevent a leak of this URB during
cleanup.

However, this patch did not take into account that usb_submit_urb() could
fail. The URB remains anchored and
usb_kill_anchored_urbs(&parent->rx_submitted) in gs_can_close() loops
infinitely since the anchor list never becomes empty.

To fix the bug, unanchor the URB when an usb_submit_urb() error occurs,
also print an info message.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23082 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
