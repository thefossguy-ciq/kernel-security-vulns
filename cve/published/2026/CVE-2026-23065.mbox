Subject: CVE-2026-23065: platform/x86/amd: Fix memory leak in wbrf_record()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd: Fix memory leak in wbrf_record()

The tmp buffer is allocated using kcalloc() but is not freed if
acpi_evaluate_dsm() fails. This causes a memory leak in the error path.

Fix this by explicitly freeing the tmp buffer in the error handling
path of acpi_evaluate_dsm().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
