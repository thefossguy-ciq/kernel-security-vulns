Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix refcount warning on event->mmap_count increment

When calling refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) inside perf_mmap_rb(), the
following warning is triggered:

        refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
        WARNING: lib/refcount.c:25

PoC:

    struct perf_event_attr attr = {0};
    int fd = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, -1, 0);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
    int victim = syscall(__NR_perf_event_open, &attr, 0, -1, fd,
                         PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT);
    mmap(NULL, 0x3000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, victim, 0);

This occurs when creating a group member event with the flag
PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT. The group leader should be mmap-ed and then mmap-ing
the event triggers the warning.

Since the event has copied the output_event in perf_event_set_output(),
event->rb is set. As a result, perf_mmap_rb() calls
refcount_inc(&event->mmap_count) when event->mmap_count = 0.

Disallow the case when event->mmap_count = 0. This also prevents two
events from updating the same user_page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23127 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/events/core.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23c0e4bd93d0b250775162faf456470485ac9fc7
