Subject: CVE-2026-23179: nvmet-tcp: fixup hang in nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-tcp: fixup hang in nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready()

When the socket is closed while in TCP_LISTEN a callback is run to
flush all outstanding packets, which in turns calls
nvmet_tcp_listen_data_ready() with the sk_callback_lock held.
So we need to check if we are in TCP_LISTEN before attempting
to get the sk_callback_lock() to avoid a deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23179 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
