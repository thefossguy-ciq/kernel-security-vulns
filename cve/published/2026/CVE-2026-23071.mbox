Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap: Fix race condition in hwspinlock irqsave routine

Previously, the address of the shared member '&map->spinlock_flags' was
passed directly to 'hwspin_lock_timeout_irqsave'. This creates a race
condition where multiple contexts contending for the lock could overwrite
the shared flags variable, potentially corrupting the state for the
current lock owner.

Fix this by using a local stack variable 'flags' to store the IRQ state
temporarily.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
