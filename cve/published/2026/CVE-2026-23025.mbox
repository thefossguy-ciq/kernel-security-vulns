Matthew has analyzed the report and identified that in drain_page_zone()
we are in a section protected by spin_lock(&pcp->lock) and then get an
interrupt that attempts spin_trylock() on the same lock.  The code is
designed to work this way without disabling IRQs and occasionally fail the
trylock with a fallback.  However, the SMP=n spinlock implementation
assumes spin_trylock() will always succeed, and thus it's normally a
no-op.  Here the enabled lock debugging catches the problem, but otherwise
it could cause a corruption of the pcp structure.

The problem has been introduced by commit 574907741599 ("mm/page_alloc:
leave IRQs enabled for per-cpu page allocations").  The pcp locking scheme
recognizes the need for disabling IRQs to prevent nesting spin_trylock()
sections on SMP=n, but the need to prevent the nesting in spin_lock() has
not been recognized.  Fix it by introducing local wrappers that change the
spin_lock() to spin_lock_iqsave() with SMP=n and use them in all places
that do spin_lock(&pcp->lock).

[vbabka@suse.cz: add pcp_ prefix to the spin_lock_irqsave wrappers, per Steven]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
