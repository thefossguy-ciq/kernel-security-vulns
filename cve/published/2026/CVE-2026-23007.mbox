Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: zero non-PI portion of auto integrity buffer

The auto-generated integrity buffer for writes needs to be fully
initialized before being passed to the underlying block device,
otherwise the uninitialized memory can be read back by userspace or
anyone with physical access to the storage device. If protection
information is generated, that portion of the integrity buffer is
already initialized. The integrity data is also zeroed if PI generation
is disabled via sysfs or the PI tuple size is 0. However, this misses
the case where PI is generated and the PI tuple size is nonzero, but the
metadata size is larger than the PI tuple. In this case, the remainder
("opaque") of the metadata is left uninitialized.
Generalize the BLK_INTEGRITY_CSUM_NONE check to cover any case when the
metadata is larger than just the PI tuple.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23007 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6072557b90e0c557df319a56f4a9dc482706d2c
