Subject: CVE-2026-23105: net/sched: qfq: Use cl_is_active to determine whether class is active in qfq_rm_from_ag

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: qfq: Use cl_is_active to determine whether class is active in qfq_rm_from_ag

This is more of a preventive patch to make the code more consistent and
to prevent possible exploits that employ child qlen manipulations on qfq.
use cl_is_active instead of relying on the child qdisc's qlen to determine
class activation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23105 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
