Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: etas_es58x: allow partial RX URB allocation to succeed

When es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() fails to allocate the requested number of
URBs but succeeds in allocating some, it returns an error code.
This causes es58x_open() to return early, skipping the cleanup label
'free_urbs', which leads to the anchored URBs being leaked.

As pointed out by maintainer Vincent Mailhol, the driver is designed
to handle partial URB allocation gracefully. Therefore, partial
allocation should not be treated as a fatal error.

Modify es58x_alloc_rx_urbs() to return 0 if at least one URB has been
allocated, restoring the intended behavior and preventing the leak
in es58x_open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23037 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
