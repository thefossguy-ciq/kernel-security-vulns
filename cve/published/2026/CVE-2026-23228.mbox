Subject: CVE-2026-23228: smb: server: fix leak of active_num_conn in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: server: fix leak of active_num_conn in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection()

On kthread_run() failure in ksmbd_tcp_new_connection(), the transport is
freed via free_transport(), which does not decrement active_num_conn,
leaking this counter.

Replace free_transport() with ksmbd_tcp_disconnect().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
