Subject: CVE-2026-23076: ALSA: ctxfi: Fix potential OOB access in audio mixer handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: ctxfi: Fix potential OOB access in audio mixer handling

In the audio mixer handling code of ctxfi driver, the conf field is
used as a kind of loop index, and it's referred in the index callbacks
(amixer_index() and sum_index()).

As spotted recently by fuzzers, the current code causes OOB access at
those functions.
| UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in /build/reproducible-path/linux-6.17.8/sound/pci/ctxfi/ctamixer.c:347:48
| index 8 is out of range for type 'unsigned char [8]'

After the analysis, the cause was found to be the lack of the proper
(re-)initialization of conj field.

This patch addresses those OOB accesses by adding the proper
initializations of the loop indices.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23076 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
