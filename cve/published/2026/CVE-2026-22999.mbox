Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_qfq: do not free existing class in qfq_change_class()

cl->qdisc and cl should only be freed if a new class and qdisc
were allocated, or we risk various UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22999 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
