Subject: CVE-2026-23134: slab: fix kmalloc_nolock() context check for PREEMPT_RT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: fix kmalloc_nolock() context check for PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, local_lock becomes a sleeping lock. The current
check in kmalloc_nolock() only verifies we're not in NMI or hard IRQ
context, but misses the case where preemption is disabled.

When a BPF program runs from a tracepoint with preemption disabled
(preempt_count > 0), kmalloc_nolock() proceeds to call
local_lock_irqsave() which attempts to acquire a sleeping lock,
triggering:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 6128
  preempt_count: 2, expected: 0

Fix this by checking !preemptible() on PREEMPT_RT, which directly
expresses the constraint that we cannot take a sleeping lock when
preemption is disabled. This encompasses the previous checks for NMI
and hard IRQ contexts while also catching cases where preemption is
disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f60ba4a97ae3f94e4818722ed2e4d260bbb17b44
