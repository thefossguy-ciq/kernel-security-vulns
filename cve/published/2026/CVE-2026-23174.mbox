Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-pci: handle changing device dma map requirements

The initial state of dma_needs_unmap may be false, but change to true
while mapping the data iterator. Enabling swiotlb is one such case that
can change the result. The nvme driver needs to save the mapped dma
vectors to be unmapped later, so allocate as needed during iteration
rather than assume it was always allocated at the beginning. This fixes
a NULL dereference from accessing an uninitialized dma_vecs when the
device dma unmapping requirements change mid-iteration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23174 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f3ed399e9aa6f36e92d2d0fe88b387915e9705fe
