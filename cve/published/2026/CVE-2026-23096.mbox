Subject: CVE-2026-23096: uacce: fix cdev handling in the cleanup path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: fix cdev handling in the cleanup path

When cdev_device_add fails, it internally releases the cdev memory,
and if cdev_device_del is then executed, it will cause a hang error.
To fix it, we check the return value of cdev_device_add() and clear
uacce->cdev to avoid calling cdev_device_del in the uacce_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23096 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
