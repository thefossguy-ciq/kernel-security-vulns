Subject: CVE-2026-23227: drm/exynos: vidi: use ctx->lock to protect struct vidi_context member variables related to memory alloc/free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/exynos: vidi: use ctx->lock to protect struct vidi_context member variables related to memory alloc/free

Exynos Virtual Display driver performs memory alloc/free operations
without lock protection, which easily causes concurrency problem.

For example, use-after-free can occur in race scenario like this:
```
	CPU0				CPU1				CPU2
	----				----				----
  vidi_connection_ioctl()
    if (vidi->connection) // true
      drm_edid = drm_edid_alloc(); // alloc drm_edid
      ...
      ctx->raw_edid = drm_edid;
      ...
								drm_mode_getconnector()
								  drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes()
								    vidi_get_modes()
								      if (ctx->raw_edid) // true
								        drm_edid_dup(ctx->raw_edid);
								          if (!drm_edid) // false
								          ...
				vidi_connection_ioctl()
				  if (vidi->connection) // false
				    drm_edid_free(ctx->raw_edid); // free drm_edid
				    ...
								          drm_edid_alloc(drm_edid->edid)
								            kmemdup(edid); // UAF!!
								            ...
```

To prevent these vulns, at least in vidi_context, member variables related
to memory alloc/free should be protected with ctx->lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23227 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/exynos_drm_vidi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
