Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/mmcid: Don't assume CID is CPU owned on mode switch

Shinichiro reported a KASAN UAF, which is actually an out of bounds access
in the MMCID management code.

   CPU0						CPU1
   						T1 runs in userspace
   T0: fork(T4) -> Switch to per CPU CID mode
         fixup() set MM_CID_TRANSIT on T1/CPU1
   T4 exit()
   T3 exit()
   T2 exit()
						T1 exit() switch to per task mode
						 ---> Out of bounds access.

As T1 has not scheduled after T0 set the TRANSIT bit, it exits with the
TRANSIT bit set. sched_mm_cid_remove_user() clears the TRANSIT bit in
the task and drops the CID, but it does not touch the per CPU storage.
That's functionally correct because a CID is only owned by the CPU when
the ONCPU bit is set, which is mutually exclusive with the TRANSIT flag.

Now sched_mm_cid_exit() assumes that the CID is CPU owned because the
prior mode was per CPU. It invokes mm_drop_cid_on_cpu() which clears the
not set ONCPU bit and then invokes clear_bit() with an insanely large
bit number because TRANSIT is set (bit 29).

Prevent that by actually validating that the CID is CPU owned in
mm_drop_cid_on_cpu().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23225 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.19.1 with commit 81f29975631db8a78651b3140ecd0f88ffafc476

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2026-23225
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/sched/core.c
	kernel/sched/sched.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81f29975631db8a78651b3140ecd0f88ffafc476
