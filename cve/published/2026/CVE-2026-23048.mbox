Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp: call skb_orphan() before skb_attempt_defer_free()

Standard UDP receive path does not use skb->destructor.

But skmsg layer does use it, since it calls skb_set_owner_sk_safe()
from udp_read_skb().

This then triggers this warning in skb_attempt_defer_free():

    DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(skb->destructor);

We must call skb_orphan() to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c63d5683eae6a7b4d81382bcbecb2a19feff90d
