Subject: CVE-2026-23158: gpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path

The gpio-virtuser configfs release path uses guard(mutex) to protect
the device structure. However, the device is freed before the guard
cleanup runs, causing mutex_unlock() to operate on freed memory.

Specifically, gpio_virtuser_device_config_group_release() destroys
the mutex and frees the device while still inside the guard(mutex)
scope. When the function returns, the guard cleanup invokes
mutex_unlock(&dev->lock), resulting in a slab use-after-free.

Limit the mutex lifetime by using a scoped_guard() only around the
activation check, so that the lock is released before mutex_destroy()
and kfree() are called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
