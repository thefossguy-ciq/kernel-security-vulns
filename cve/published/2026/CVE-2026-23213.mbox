Subject: CVE-2026-23213: drm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: Disable MMIO access during SMU Mode 1 reset

During Mode 1 reset, the ASIC undergoes a reset cycle and becomes
temporarily inaccessible via PCIe. Any attempt to access MMIO registers
during this window (e.g., from interrupt handlers or other driver threads)
can result in uncompleted PCIe transactions, leading to NMI panics or
system hangs.

To prevent this, set the `no_hw_access` flag to true immediately after
triggering the reset. This signals other driver components to skip
register accesses while the device is offline.

A memory barrier `smp_mb()` is added to ensure the flag update is
globally visible to all cores before the driver enters the sleep/wait
state.

(cherry picked from commit 7edb503fe4b6d67f47d8bb0dfafb8e699bb0f8a4)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23213 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
