Subject: CVE-2026-23015: gpio: mpsse: fix reference leak in gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: mpsse: fix reference leak in gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths

The reference obtained by calling usb_get_dev() is not released in the
gpio_mpsse_probe() error paths. Fix that by using device managed helper
functions. Also remove the usb_put_dev() call in the disconnect function
since now it will be released automatically.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7ea26e6dcabc270433b6ded2a1aee85b215d1b28
