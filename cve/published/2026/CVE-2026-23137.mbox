Subject: CVE-2026-23137: of: unittest: Fix memory leak in unittest_data_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: unittest: Fix memory leak in unittest_data_add()

In unittest_data_add(), if of_resolve_phandles() fails, the allocated
unittest_data is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

Fix this by using scope-based cleanup helper __free(kfree) for automatic
resource cleanup. This ensures unittest_data is automatically freed when
it goes out of scope in error paths.

For the success path, use retain_and_null_ptr() to transfer ownership
of the memory to the device tree and prevent double freeing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23137 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
