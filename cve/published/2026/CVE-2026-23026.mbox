Subject: CVE-2026-23026: dmaengine: qcom: gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: qcom: gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()

Fix a memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config() where the original memory
pointed to by gchan->config could be lost if krealloc() fails.

The issue occurs when:
1. gchan->config points to previously allocated memory
2. krealloc() fails and returns NULL
3. The function directly assigns NULL to gchan->config, losing the
   reference to the original memory
4. The original memory becomes unreachable and cannot be freed

Fix this by using a temporary variable to hold the krealloc() result
and only updating gchan->config when the allocation succeeds.

Found via static analysis and code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23026 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
