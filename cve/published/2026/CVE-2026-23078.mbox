Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: scarlett2: Fix buffer overflow in config retrieval

The scarlett2_usb_get_config() function has a logic error in the
endianness conversion code that can cause buffer overflows when
count > 1.

The code checks `if (size == 2)` where `size` is the total buffer size in
bytes, then loops `count` times treating each element as u16 (2 bytes).
This causes the loop to access `count * 2` bytes when the buffer only
has `size` bytes allocated.

Fix by checking the element size (config_item->size) instead of the
total buffer size. This ensures the endianness conversion matches the
actual element type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
