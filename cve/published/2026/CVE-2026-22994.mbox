Subject: CVE-2026-22994: bpf: Fix reference count leak in bpf_prog_test_run_xdp()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix reference count leak in bpf_prog_test_run_xdp()

syzbot is reporting

  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sit0 to become free. Usage count = 2

problem. A debug printk() patch found that a refcount is obtained at
xdp_convert_md_to_buff() from bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().

According to commit ec94670fcb3b ("bpf: Support specifying ingress via
xdp_md context in BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN"), the refcount obtained by
xdp_convert_md_to_buff() will be released by xdp_convert_buff_to_md().

Therefore, we can consider that the error handling path introduced by
commit 1c1949982524 ("bpf: introduce frags support to
bpf_prog_test_run_xdp()") forgot to call xdp_convert_buff_to_md().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
