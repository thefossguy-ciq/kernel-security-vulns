Subject: CVE-2026-22982: net: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag

Commit 15faa1f67ab4 ("lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag")
fixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.
The ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic
and is susceptible to the same crash.

This issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves
unused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as
it uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.

Fix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
