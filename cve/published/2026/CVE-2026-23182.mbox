Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra: Fix a memory leak in tegra_slink_probe()

In tegra_slink_probe(), when platform_get_irq() fails, it directly
returns from the function with an error code, which causes a memory leak.

Replace it with a goto label to ensure proper cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23182 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
