Subject: CVE-2026-23131: platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kobject warnings for empty attribute names

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix kobject warnings for empty attribute names

The hp-bioscfg driver attempts to register kobjects with empty names when
the HP BIOS returns attributes with empty name strings. This causes
multiple kernel warnings:

  kobject: (00000000135fb5e6): attempted to be registered with empty name!
  WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 3336 at lib/kobject.c:219 kobject_add_internal+0x2eb/0x310

Add validation in hp_init_bios_buffer_attribute() to check if the
attribute name is empty after parsing it from the WMI buffer. If empty,
log a debug message and skip registration of that attribute, allowing the
module to continue processing other valid attributes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
