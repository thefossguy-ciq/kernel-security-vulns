Subject: CVE-2026-23191: ALSA: aloop: Fix racy access at PCM trigger

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: aloop: Fix racy access at PCM trigger

The PCM trigger callback of aloop driver tries to check the PCM state
and stop the stream of the tied substream in the corresponding cable.
Since both check and stop operations are performed outside the cable
lock, this may result in UAF when a program attempts to trigger
frequently while opening/closing the tied stream, as spotted by
fuzzers.

For addressing the UAF, this patch changes two things:
- It covers the most of code in loopback_check_format() with
  cable->lock spinlock, and add the proper NULL checks.  This avoids
  already some racy accesses.
- In addition, now we try to check the state of the capture PCM stream
  that may be stopped in this function, which was the major pain point
  leading to UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
