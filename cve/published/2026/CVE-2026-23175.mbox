Subject: CVE-2026-23175: net: cpsw: Execute ndo_set_rx_mode callback in a work queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: cpsw: Execute ndo_set_rx_mode callback in a work queue

Commit 1767bb2d47b7 ("ipv6: mcast: Don't hold RTNL for
IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP.") removed the RTNL lock for
IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_GROUP operations. However, this
change triggered the following call trace on my BeagleBone Black board:
  WARNING: net/8021q/vlan_core.c:236 at vlan_for_each+0x120/0x124, CPU#0: rpcbind/481
  RTNL: assertion failed at net/8021q/vlan_core.c (236)

   __sys_setsockopt from ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x54

This trace occurs because vlan_for_each() is called within
cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode(), which expects the RTNL lock to be held.
Since modifying vlan_for_each() to operate without the RTNL lock is not
straightforward, and because ndo_set_rx_mode() is invoked both with and
without the RTNL lock across different code paths, simply adding
rtnl_lock() in cpsw_ndo_set_rx_mode() is not a viable solution.

To resolve this issue, we opt to execute the actual processing within
a work queue, following the approach used by the icssg-prueth driver.

Please note: To reproduce this issue, I manually reverted the changes to
am335x-bone-common.dtsi from commit c477358e66a3 ("ARM: dts: am335x-bone:
switch to new cpsw switch drv") in order to revert to the legacy cpsw
driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/488009aa62bb1217ea0624fd5108b79adef4e148
