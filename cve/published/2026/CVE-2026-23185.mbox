Subject: CVE-2026-23185: wifi: iwlwifi: mld: cancel mlo_scan_start_wk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mld: cancel mlo_scan_start_wk

mlo_scan_start_wk is not canceled on disconnection. In fact, it is not
canceled anywhere except in the restart cleanup, where we don't really
have to.

This can cause an init-after-queue issue: if, for example, the work was
queued and then drv_change_interface got executed.

This can also cause use-after-free: if the work is executed after the
vif is freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23185 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
