Subject: CVE-2026-23098: netrom: fix double-free in nr_route_frame()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netrom: fix double-free in nr_route_frame()

In nr_route_frame(), old_skb is immediately freed without checking if
nr_neigh->ax25 pointer is NULL. Therefore, if nr_neigh->ax25 is NULL,
the caller function will free old_skb again, causing a double-free bug.

Therefore, to prevent this, we need to modify it to check whether
nr_neigh->ax25 is NULL before freeing old_skb.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23098 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
