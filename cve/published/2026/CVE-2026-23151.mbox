Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete

Fix memory leak in set_ssp_complete() where mgmt_pending_cmd structures
are not freed after being removed from the pending list.

Commit 302a1f674c00 ("Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix possible UAFs") replaced
mgmt_pending_foreach() calls with individual command handling but missed
adding mgmt_pending_free() calls in both error and success paths of
set_ssp_complete(). Other completion functions like set_le_complete()
were fixed correctly in the same commit.

This causes a memory leak of the mgmt_pending_cmd structure and its
associated parameter data for each SSP command that completes.

Add the missing mgmt_pending_free(cmd) calls in both code paths to fix
the memory leak. Also fix the same issue in set_advertising_complete().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23151 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
