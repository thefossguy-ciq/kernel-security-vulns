Subject: CVE-2026-23043: btrfs: fix NULL pointer dereference in do_abort_log_replay()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix NULL pointer dereference in do_abort_log_replay()

Coverity reported a NULL pointer dereference issue (CID 1666756) in
do_abort_log_replay(). When btrfs_alloc_path() fails in
replay_one_buffer(), wc->subvol_path is NULL, but btrfs_abort_log_replay()
calls do_abort_log_replay() which unconditionally dereferences
wc->subvol_path when attempting to print debug information. Fix this by
adding a NULL check before dereferencing wc->subvol_path in
do_abort_log_replay().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23043 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
