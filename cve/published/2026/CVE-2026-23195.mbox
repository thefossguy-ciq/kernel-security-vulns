Subject: CVE-2026-23195: cgroup/dmem: avoid pool UAF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup/dmem: avoid pool UAF

An UAF issue was observed:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in page_counter_uncharge+0x65/0x150
Write of size 8 at addr ffff888106715440 by task insmod/527

CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 527 Comm: insmod    6.19.0-rc7-next-20260129+ #11

Freed by task 0:

The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff888106715400
which belongs to the cache kmalloc-512 of size 512
The buggy address is located 64 bytes inside of
freed 512-byte region [ffff888106715400, ffff888106715600)

The buggy address belongs to the physical page:

Memory state around the buggy address:
ffff888106715300: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc

ffff888106715500: fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb fb

The issue occurs because a pool can still be held by a caller after its
associated memory region is unregistered. The current implementation frees
the pool even if users still hold references to it (e.g., before uncharge
operations complete).

This patch adds a reference counter to each pool, ensuring that a pool is
only freed when its reference count drops to zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23195 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3081353acaa6a638dcf75726066ea556a2de8d5
