Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dpaa2-switch: prevent ZERO_SIZE_PTR dereference when num_ifs is zero

The driver allocates arrays for ports, FDBs, and filter blocks using
kcalloc() with ethsw->sw_attr.num_ifs as the element count. When the
device reports zero interfaces (either due to hardware configuration
or firmware issues), kcalloc(0, ...) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR (0x10)
instead of NULL.

Later in dpaa2_switch_probe(), the NAPI initialization unconditionally
accesses ethsw->ports[0]->netdev, which attempts to dereference
ZERO_SIZE_PTR (address 0x10), resulting in a kernel panic.

Add a check to ensure num_ifs is greater than zero after retrieving
device attributes. This prevents the zero-sized allocations and
subsequent invalid pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23206 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
