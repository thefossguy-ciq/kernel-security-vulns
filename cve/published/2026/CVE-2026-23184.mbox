Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix UAF in binder_netlink_report()

Oneway transactions sent to frozen targets via binder_proc_transaction()
return a BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN error but they are still treated
as successful since the target is expected to thaw at some point. It is
then not safe to access 't' after BR_TRANSACTION_PENDING_FROZEN errors
as the transaction could have been consumed by the now thawed target.

This is the case for binder_netlink_report() which derreferences 't'
after a pending frozen error, as pointed out by the following KASAN
report:

  ==================================================================

Instead, make a transaction copy so the data can be safely accessed by
binder_netlink_report() after a pending frozen error. While here, add a
comment about not using t->buffer in binder_netlink_report().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a6050dedb6f1cc23e518e3a132ab74a0aad6df90
