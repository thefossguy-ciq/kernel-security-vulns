Subject: CVE-2026-23148: nvmet: fix race in nvmet_bio_done() leading to NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix race in nvmet_bio_done() leading to NULL pointer dereference

There is a race condition in nvmet_bio_done() that can cause a NULL
pointer dereference in blk_cgroup_bio_start():

1. nvmet_bio_done() is called when a bio completes
2. nvmet_req_complete() is called, which invokes req->ops->queue_response(req)
3. The queue_response callback can re-queue and re-submit the same request
4. The re-submission reuses the same inline_bio from nvmet_req
5. Meanwhile, nvmet_req_bio_put() (called after nvmet_req_complete)
   invokes bio_uninit() for inline_bio, which sets bio->bi_blkg to NULL
6. The re-submitted bio enters submit_bio_noacct_nocheck()
7. blk_cgroup_bio_start() dereferences bio->bi_blkg, causing a crash:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028
  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
  RIP: 0010:blk_cgroup_bio_start+0x10/0xd0
  Call Trace:
   submit_bio_noacct_nocheck+0x44/0x250
   nvmet_bdev_execute_rw+0x254/0x370 [nvmet]
   process_one_work+0x193/0x3c0
   worker_thread+0x281/0x3a0

Fix this by reordering nvmet_bio_done() to call nvmet_req_bio_put()
BEFORE nvmet_req_complete(). This ensures the bio is cleaned up before
the request can be re-submitted, preventing the race condition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23148 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee10b06980acca1d46e0fa36d6fb4a9578eab6e4
