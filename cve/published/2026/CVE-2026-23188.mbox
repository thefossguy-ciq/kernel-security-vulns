Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: r8152: fix resume reset deadlock

rtl8152 can trigger device reset during reset which
potentially can result in a deadlock:

 **** DPM device timeout after 10 seconds; 15 seconds until panic ****
 Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 schedule+0x483/0x1370
 schedule_preempt_disabled+0x15/0x30

 usb_resume_interface+0x3e/0xc0
 usb_resume_both+0x104/0x150
 usb_resume+0x22/0x110

The problem is that rtl8152 resume calls reset under
tp->control mutex while reset basically re-enters rtl8152
and attempts to acquire the same tp->control lock once
again.

Reset INACCESSIBLE device outside of tp->control mutex
scope to avoid recursive mutex_lock() deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
