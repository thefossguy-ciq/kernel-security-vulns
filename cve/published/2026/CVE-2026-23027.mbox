Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: KVM: Fix kvm_device leak in kvm_pch_pic_destroy()

In kvm_ioctl_create_device(), kvm_device has allocated memory,
kvm_device->destroy() seems to be supposed to free its kvm_device
struct, but kvm_pch_pic_destroy() is not currently doing this, that
would lead to a memory leak.

So, fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23027 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.18.7 with commit fc53a66227af08d868face4b33fa8b2e1ba187ed
	Fixed in 6.19-rc6 with commit 1cf342a7c3adc5877837b53bbceb5cc9eff60bbf

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2026-23027
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/loongarch/kvm/intc/pch_pic.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc53a66227af08d868face4b33fa8b2e1ba187ed
