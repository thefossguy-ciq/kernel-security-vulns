Subject: CVE-2026-22978: wifi: avoid kernel-infoleak from struct iw_point

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: avoid kernel-infoleak from struct iw_point

struct iw_point has a 32bit hole on 64bit arches.

struct iw_point {
  void __user   *pointer;       /* Pointer to the data  (in user space) */
  __u16         length;         /* number of fields or size in bytes */
  __u16         flags;          /* Optional params */
};

Make sure to zero the structure to avoid disclosing 32bits of kernel data
to user space.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
