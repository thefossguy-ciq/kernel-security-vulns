Subject: CVE-2026-22990: libceph: replace overzealous BUG_ON in osdmap_apply_incremental()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libceph: replace overzealous BUG_ON in osdmap_apply_incremental()

If the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted such that the incremental
osdmap epoch is different from what is expected, there is no need to
BUG.  Instead, just declare the incremental osdmap to be invalid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-22990 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
