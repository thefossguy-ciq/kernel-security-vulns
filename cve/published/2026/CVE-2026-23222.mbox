Subject: CVE-2026-23222: crypto: omap - Allocate OMAP_CRYPTO_FORCE_COPY scatterlists correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: omap - Allocate OMAP_CRYPTO_FORCE_COPY scatterlists correctly

The existing allocation of scatterlists in omap_crypto_copy_sg_lists()
was allocating an array of scatterlist pointers, not scatterlist objects,
resulting in a 4x too small allocation.

Use sizeof(*new_sg) to get the correct object size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
