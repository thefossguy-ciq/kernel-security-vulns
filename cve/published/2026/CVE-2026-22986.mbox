Subject: CVE-2026-22986: gpiolib: fix race condition for gdev->srcu

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: fix race condition for gdev->srcu

If two drivers were calling gpiochip_add_data_with_key(), one may be
traversing the srcu-protected list in gpio_name_to_desc(), meanwhile
other has just added its gdev in gpiodev_add_to_list_unlocked().
This creates a non-mutexed and non-protected timeframe, when one
instance is dereferencing and using &gdev->srcu, before the other
has initialized it, resulting in crash:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fb674c8f1a5d8dd3113a7326030f963fa2d79c02
