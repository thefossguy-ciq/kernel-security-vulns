Subject: CVE-2026-23226: ksmbd: add chann_lock to protect ksmbd_chann_list xarray

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: add chann_lock to protect ksmbd_chann_list xarray

ksmbd_chann_list xarray lacks synchronization, allowing use-after-free in
multi-channel sessions (between lookup_chann_list() and ksmbd_chann_del).

Adds rw_semaphore chann_lock to struct ksmbd_session and protects
all xa_load/xa_store/xa_erase accesses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23226 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
