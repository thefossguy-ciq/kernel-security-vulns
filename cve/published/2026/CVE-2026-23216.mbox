Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix use-after-free in iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count()

In iscsit_dec_conn_usage_count(), the function calls complete() while
holding the conn->conn_usage_lock. As soon as complete() is invoked, the
waiter (such as iscsit_close_connection()) may wake up and proceed to free
the iscsit_conn structure.

If the waiter frees the memory before the current thread reaches
spin_unlock_bh(), it results in a KASAN slab-use-after-free as the function
attempts to release a lock within the already-freed connection structure.

Fix this by releasing the spinlock before calling complete().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23216 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
