Subject: CVE-2026-23109: fs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/writeback: skip AS_NO_DATA_INTEGRITY mappings in wait_sb_inodes()

Above the while() loop in wait_sb_inodes(), we document that we must wait
for all pages under writeback for data integrity.  Consequently, if a
mapping, like fuse, traditionally does not have data integrity semantics,
there is no need to wait at all; we can simply skip these inodes.

This restores fuse back to prior behavior where syncs are no-ops.  This
fixes a user regression where if a system is running a faulty fuse server
that does not reply to issued write requests, this causes wait_sb_inodes()
to wait forever.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23109 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/fs-writeback.c
	fs/fuse/file.c
	include/linux/pagemap.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f4ed5e2b8f111553562507ad6202432c7c57731
