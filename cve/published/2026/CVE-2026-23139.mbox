Subject: CVE-2026-23139: netfilter: nf_conncount: update last_gc only when GC has been performed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_conncount: update last_gc only when GC has been performed

Currently last_gc is being updated everytime a new connection is
tracked, that means that it is updated even if a GC wasn't performed.
With a sufficiently high packet rate, it is possible to always bypass
the GC, causing the list to grow infinitely.

Update the last_gc value only when a GC has been actually performed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23139 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
