Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix oops due to invalid pointer for kfree() in parse_longname()

This fixes a kernel oops when reading ceph snapshot directories (.snap),
for example by simply running `ls /mnt/my_ceph/.snap`.

The variable str is guarded by __free(kfree), but advanced by one for
skipping the initial '_' in snapshot names. Thus, kfree() is called
with an invalid pointer.  This patch removes the need for advancing the
pointer so kfree() is called with correct memory pointer.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create snapshots on a cephfs volume (I've 63 snaps in my testcase)

2. Add cephfs mount to fstab
$ echo "samba-fileserver@.files=/volumes/datapool/stuff/3461082b-ecc9-4e82-8549-3fd2590d3fb6      /mnt/test/stuff   ceph     acl,noatime,_netdev    0       0" >> /etc/fstab

3. Reboot the system
$ systemctl reboot

4. Check if it's really mounted
$ mount | grep stuff

5. List snapshots (expected 63 snapshots on my system)
$ ls /mnt/test/stuff/.snap

Now ls hangs forever and the kernel log shows the oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23201 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
