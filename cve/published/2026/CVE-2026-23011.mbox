Subject: CVE-2026-23011: ipv4: ip_gre: make ipgre_header() robust

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: ip_gre: make ipgre_header() robust

Analog to commit db5b4e39c4e6 ("ip6_gre: make ip6gre_header() robust")

Over the years, syzbot found many ways to crash the kernel
in ipgre_header() [1].

This involves team or bonding drivers ability to dynamically
change their dev->needed_headroom and/or dev->hard_header_len

In this particular crash mld_newpack() allocated an skb
with a too small reserve/headroom, and by the time mld_sendpack()
was called, syzbot managed to attach an ipgre device.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
