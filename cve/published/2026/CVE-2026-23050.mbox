Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pNFS: Fix a deadlock when returning a delegation during open()

Ben Coddington reports seeing a hang in the following stack trace:

 19 [ffffd0b50e177bd0] dentry_open at ffffffff9c0a0935

The issue is that the delegreturn is being asked to wait for a layout
return that cannot complete because a state recovery was initiated. The
state recovery cannot complete until the open() finishes processing the
delegations it was given.

The solution is to propagate the existing flags that indicate a
non-blocking call to the function pnfs_roc(), so that it knows not to
wait in this situation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
