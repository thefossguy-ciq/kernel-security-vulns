Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: ensure safe queue release with state management

Directly calling `put_queue` carries risks since it cannot
guarantee that resources of `uacce_queue` have been fully released
beforehand. So adding a `stop_queue` operation for the
UACCE_CMD_PUT_Q command and leaving the `put_queue` operation to
the final resource release ensures safety.

Queue states are defined as follows:
- UACCE_Q_ZOMBIE: Initial state
- UACCE_Q_INIT: After opening `uacce`
- UACCE_Q_STARTED: After `start` is issued via `ioctl`

When executing `poweroff -f` in virt while accelerator are still
working, `uacce_fops_release` and `uacce_remove` may execute
concurrently. This can cause `uacce_put_queue` within
`uacce_fops_release` to access a NULL `ops` pointer. Therefore, add
state checks to prevent accessing freed pointers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
