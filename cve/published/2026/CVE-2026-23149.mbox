Subject: CVE-2026-23149: drm: Do not allow userspace to trigger kernel warnings in drm_gem_change_handle_ioctl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: Do not allow userspace to trigger kernel warnings in drm_gem_change_handle_ioctl()

Since GEM bo handles are u32 in the uapi and the internal implementation
uses idr_alloc() which uses int ranges, passing a new handle larger than
INT_MAX trivially triggers a kernel warning:

idr_alloc():
...
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(start < 0))
		return -EINVAL;
...

Fix it by rejecting new handles above INT_MAX and at the same time make
the end limit calculation more obvious by moving into int domain.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23149 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae8831ee0fb2f5f41f39722e7b3749d65bb78d08
