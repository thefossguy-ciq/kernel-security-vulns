Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: i2c-hid: fix potential buffer overflow in i2c_hid_get_report()

`i2c_hid_xfer` is used to read `recv_len + sizeof(__le16)` bytes of data
into `ihid->rawbuf`.

The former can come from the userspace in the hidraw driver and is only
bounded by HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE(16384) by default (unless we also set
`max_buffer_size` field of `struct hid_ll_driver` which we do not).

The latter has size determined at runtime by the maximum size of
different report types you could receive on any particular device and
can be a much smaller value.

Fix this by truncating `recv_len` to `ihid->bufsize - sizeof(__le16)`.

The impact is low since access to hidraw devices requires root.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23178 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/hid/i2c-hid/i2c-hid-core.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
