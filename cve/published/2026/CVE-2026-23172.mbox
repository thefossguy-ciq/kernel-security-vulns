Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: t7xx: fix potential skb->frags overflow in RX path

When receiving data in the DPMAIF RX path,
the t7xx_dpmaif_set_frag_to_skb() function adds
page fragments to an skb without checking if the number of
fragments has exceeded MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This could lead to a buffer overflow
in skb_shinfo(skb)->frags[] array, corrupting adjacent memory and
potentially causing kernel crashes or other undefined behavior.

This issue was identified through static code analysis by comparing with a
similar vulnerability fixed in the mt76 driver commit b102f0c522cf ("mt76:
fix array overflow on receiving too many fragments for a packet").

The vulnerability could be triggered if the modem firmware sends packets
with excessive fragments. While under normal protocol conditions (MTU 3080
bytes, BAT buffer 3584 bytes),
a single packet should not require additional
fragments, the kernel should not blindly trust firmware behavior.
Malicious, buggy, or compromised firmware could potentially craft packets
with more fragments than the kernel expects.

Fix this by adding a bounds check before calling skb_add_rx_frag() to
ensure nr_frags does not exceed MAX_SKB_FRAGS.

The check must be performed before unmapping to avoid a page leak
and double DMA unmap during device teardown.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23172 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
