Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix ECMP sibling count mismatch when clearing RTF_ADDRCONF

syzbot reported a kernel BUG in fib6_add_rt2node() when adding an IPv6
route. [0]

Commit f72514b3c569 ("ipv6: clear RA flags when adding a static
route") introduced logic to clear RTF_ADDRCONF from existing routes
when a static route with the same nexthop is added. However, this
causes a problem when the existing route has a gateway.

When RTF_ADDRCONF is cleared from a route that has a gateway, that
route becomes eligible for ECMP, i.e. rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() returns
true. The issue is that this route was never added to the
fib6_siblings list.

This leads to a mismatch between the following counts:

- The sibling count computed by iterating fib6_next chain, which
  includes the newly ECMP-eligible route

- The actual siblings in fib6_siblings list, which does not include
  that route

When a subsequent ECMP route is added, fib6_add_rt2node() hits
BUG_ON(sibling->fib6_nsiblings != rt->fib6_nsiblings) because the
counts don't match.

Fix this by only clearing RTF_ADDRCONF when the existing route does
not have a gateway. Routes without a gateway cannot qualify for ECMP
anyway (rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() requires fib_nh_gw_family), so clearing
RTF_ADDRCONF on them is safe and matches the original intent of the
commit.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
