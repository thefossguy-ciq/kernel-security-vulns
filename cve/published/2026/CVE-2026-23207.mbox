Subject: CVE-2026-23207: spi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer check in IRQ handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra210-quad: Protect curr_xfer check in IRQ handler

Now that all other accesses to curr_xfer are done under the lock,
protect the curr_xfer NULL check in tegra_qspi_isr_thread() with the
spinlock. Without this protection, the following race can occur:

  CPU0 (ISR thread)              CPU1 (timeout path)
  ----------------               -------------------
  if (!tqspi->curr_xfer)
    // sees non-NULL
                                 spin_lock()
                                 tqspi->curr_xfer = NULL
                                 spin_unlock()
  handle_*_xfer()
    spin_lock()
    t = tqspi->curr_xfer  // NULL!
    ... t->len ...        // NULL dereference!

With this patch, all curr_xfer accesses are now properly synchronized.

Although all accesses to curr_xfer are done under the lock, in
tegra_qspi_isr_thread() it checks for NULL, releases the lock and
reacquires it later in handle_cpu_based_xfer()/handle_dma_based_xfer().
There is a potential for an update in between, which could cause a NULL
pointer dereference.

To handle this, add a NULL check inside the handlers after acquiring
the lock. This ensures that if the timeout path has already cleared
curr_xfer, the handler will safely return without dereferencing the
NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
