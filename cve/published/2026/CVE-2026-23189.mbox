Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix NULL pointer dereference in ceph_mds_auth_match()

The CephFS kernel client has regression starting from 6.18-rc1.
We have issue in ceph_mds_auth_match() if fs_name == NULL:

    const char fs_name = mdsc->fsc->mount_options->mds_namespace;
    ...
    if (auth->match.fs_name && strcmp(auth->match.fs_name, fs_name)) {
            / fsname mismatch, try next one */
            return 0;
    }

Patrick Donnelly suggested that: In summary, we should definitely start
decoding `fs_name` from the MDSMap and do strict authorizations checks
against it. Note that the `-o mds_namespace=foo` should only be used for
selecting the file system to mount and nothing else. It's possible
no mds_namespace is specified but the kernel will mount the only
file system that exists which may have name "foo".

This patch reworks ceph_mdsmap_decode() and namespace_equals() with
the goal of supporting the suggested concept. Now struct ceph_mdsmap
contains m_fs_name field that receives copy of extracted FS name
by ceph_extract_encoded_string(). For the case of "old" CephFS file
systems, it is used "cephfs" name.

[ idryomov: replace redundant %*pE with %s in ceph_mdsmap_decode(),
  get rid of a series of strlen() calls in ceph_namespace_match(),
  drop changes to namespace_equals() body to avoid treating empty
  mds_namespace as equal, drop changes to ceph_mdsc_handle_fsmap()
  as namespace_equals() isn't an equivalent substitution there ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23189 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
