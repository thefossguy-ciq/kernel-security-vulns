Subject: CVE-2026-23069: vsock/virtio: fix potential underflow in virtio_transport_get_credit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: fix potential underflow in virtio_transport_get_credit()

The credit calculation in virtio_transport_get_credit() uses unsigned
arithmetic:

  ret = vvs->peer_buf_alloc - (vvs->tx_cnt - vvs->peer_fwd_cnt);

If the peer shrinks its advertised buffer (peer_buf_alloc) while bytes
are in flight, the subtraction can underflow and produce a large
positive value, potentially allowing more data to be queued than the
peer can handle.

Reuse virtio_transport_has_space() which already handles this case and
add a comment to make it clear why we are doing that.

[Stefano: use virtio_transport_has_space() instead of duplicating the code]
[Stefano: tweak the commit message]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23069 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
