Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Prevent excessive number of frames

In this case, the user constructed the parameters with maxpacksize 40
for rate 22050 / pps 1000, and packsize[0] 22 packsize[1] 23. The buffer
size for each data URB is maxpacksize * packets, which in this example
is 40 * 6 = 240; When the user performs a write operation to send audio
data into the ALSA PCM playback stream, the calculated number of frames
is packsize[0] * packets = 264, which exceeds the allocated URB buffer
size, triggering the out-of-bounds (OOB) issue reported by syzbot [1].

Added a check for the number of single data URB frames when calculating
the number of frames to prevent [1].

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
