Subject: CVE-2026-23056: uacce: implement mremap in uacce_vm_ops to return -EPERM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uacce: implement mremap in uacce_vm_ops to return -EPERM

The current uacce_vm_ops does not support the mremap operation of
vm_operations_struct. Implement .mremap to return -EPERM to remind
users.

The reason we need to explicitly disable mremap is that when the
driver does not implement .mremap, it uses the default mremap
method. This could lead to a risk scenario:

An application might first mmap address p1, then mremap to p2,
followed by munmap(p1), and finally munmap(p2). Since the default
mremap copies the original vma's vm_private_data (i.e., q) to the
new vma, both munmap operations would trigger vma_close, causing
q->qfr to be freed twice(qfr will be set to null here, so repeated
release is ok).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
