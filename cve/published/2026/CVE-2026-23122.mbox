Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: Reduce TSN TX packet buffer from 7KB to 5KB per queue

The previous 7 KB per queue caused TX unit hangs under heavy
timestamping load. Reducing to 5 KB avoids these hangs and matches
the TSN recommendation in I225/I226 SW User Manual Section 7.5.4.

The 8 KB "freed" by this change is currently unused. This reduction
is not expected to impact throughput, as the i226 is PCIe-limited
for small TSN packets rather than TX-buffer-limited.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23122 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/88037973c8ef6032bf84e9955595f8b20bc14c21
