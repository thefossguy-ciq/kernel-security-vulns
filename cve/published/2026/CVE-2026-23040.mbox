Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211_hwsim: fix typo in frequency notification

The NAN notification is for 5745 MHz which corresponds to channel 149
and not 5475 which is not actually a valid channel. This could result in
a NULL pointer dereference in cfg80211_next_nan_dw_notif.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23040 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1251bbdb8f5b2ea86ca9b4268a2e6aa34372ab33
