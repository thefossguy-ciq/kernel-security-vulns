Subject: CVE-2026-23223: xfs: fix UAF in xchk_btree_check_block_owner

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: fix UAF in xchk_btree_check_block_owner

We cannot dereference bs->cur when trying to determine if bs->cur
aliases bs->sc->sa.{bno,rmap}_cur after the latter has been freed.
Fix this by sampling before type before any freeing could happen.
The correct temporal ordering was broken when we removed xfs_btnum_t.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23223 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
