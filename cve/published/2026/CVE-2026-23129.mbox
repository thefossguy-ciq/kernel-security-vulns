Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dpll: Prevent duplicate registrations

Modify the internal registration helpers dpll_xa_ref_{dpll,pin}_add()
to reject duplicate registration attempts.

Previously, if a caller attempted to register the same pin multiple
times (with the same ops, priv, and cookie) on the same device, the core
silently increments the reference count and return success. This behavior
is incorrect because if the caller makes these duplicate registrations
then for the first one dpll_pin_registration is allocated and for others
the associated dpll_pin_ref.refcount is incremented. During the first
unregistration the associated dpll_pin_registration is freed and for
others WARN is fired.

Fix this by updating the logic to return `-EEXIST` if a matching
registration is found to enforce a strict "register once" policy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dfec0501dba8f4711ef142a6a890e4812b7af88c
