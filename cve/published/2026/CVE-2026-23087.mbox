Subject: CVE-2026-23087: scsi: xen: scsiback: Fix potential memory leak in scsiback_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: xen: scsiback: Fix potential memory leak in scsiback_remove()

Memory allocated for struct vscsiblk_info in scsiback_probe() is not
freed in scsiback_remove() leading to potential memory leaks on remove,
as well as in the scsiback_probe() error paths. Fix that by freeing it
in scsiback_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
