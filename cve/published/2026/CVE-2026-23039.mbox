Subject: CVE-2026-23039: drm/gud: fix NULL fb and crtc dereferences on USB disconnect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/gud: fix NULL fb and crtc dereferences on USB disconnect

On disconnect drm_atomic_helper_disable_all() is called which
sets both the fb and crtc for a plane to NULL before invoking a commit.

This causes a kernel oops on every display disconnect.

Add guards for those dereferences.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a255ec07f91d4c73a361a28b7a3d82f5710245f1
