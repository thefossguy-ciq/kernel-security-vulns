Subject: CVE-2026-23030: phy: rockchip: inno-usb2: Fix a double free bug in rockchip_usb2phy_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: rockchip: inno-usb2: Fix a double free bug in rockchip_usb2phy_probe()

The for_each_available_child_of_node() calls of_node_put() to
release child_np in each success loop. After breaking from the
loop with the child_np has been released, the code will jump to
the put_child label and will call the of_node_put() again if the
devm_request_threaded_irq() fails. These cause a double free bug.

Fix by returning directly to avoid the duplicate of_node_put().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2026-23030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
