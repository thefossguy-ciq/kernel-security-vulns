Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: Fix a potential use after free

Free the adap structure only after we are done using it.
This patch just moves the put_device() down a bit to avoid the
use after free.

[wsa: added comment to the code, added Fixes tag]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2019-25162 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
