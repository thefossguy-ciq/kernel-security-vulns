Subject: CVE-2025-23163: net: vlan: don't propagate flags on open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: vlan: don't propagate flags on open

With the device instance lock, there is now a possibility of a deadlock:

Device setup:

     netdevsim0 (down)
     ^        ^
  bond        netdevsim1.100@netdevsim1 allmulticast=on (down)

When we enslave the lower device (netdevsim0) which has a vlan, we
propagate vlan's allmuti/promisc flags during ndo_open. This causes
(re)locking on of the real_dev.

Propagate allmulti/promisc on flags change, not on the open. There
is a slight semantics change that vlans that are down now propagate
the flags, but this seems unlikely to result in the real issues.

Reproducer:

  echo 0 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device

  dev_path=$(ls -d /sys/bus/netdevsim/devices/netdevsim0/net/*)
  dev=$(echo $dev_path | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev)

  ip link set dev $dev name netdevsim0
  ip link set dev netdevsim0 up

  ip link add link netdevsim0 name netdevsim0.100 type vlan id 100
  ip link set dev netdevsim0.100 allmulticast on down
  ip link add name bond1 type bond mode 802.3ad
  ip link set dev netdevsim0 down
  ip link set dev netdevsim0 master bond1
  ip link set dev bond1 up
  ip link show

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23163 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
