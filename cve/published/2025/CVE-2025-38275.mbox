Subject: CVE-2025-38275: phy: qcom-qmp-usb: Fix an NULL vs IS_ERR() bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: qcom-qmp-usb: Fix an NULL vs IS_ERR() bug

The qmp_usb_iomap() helper function currently returns the raw result of
devm_ioremap() for non-exclusive mappings. Since devm_ioremap() may return
a NULL pointer and the caller only checks error pointers with IS_ERR(),
NULL could bypass the check and lead to an invalid dereference.

Fix the issue by checking if devm_ioremap() returns NULL. When it does,
qmp_usb_iomap() now returns an error pointer via IOMEM_ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM),
ensuring safe and consistent error handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38275 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
