Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: accel: fxls8962af: Fix use after free in fxls8962af_fifo_flush

fxls8962af_fifo_flush() uses indio_dev->active_scan_mask (with
iio_for_each_active_channel()) without making sure the indio_dev
stays in buffer mode.
There is a race if indio_dev exits buffer mode in the middle of the
interrupt that flushes the fifo. Fix this by calling
synchronize_irq() to ensure that no interrupt is currently running when
disabling buffer mode.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000 when read

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
