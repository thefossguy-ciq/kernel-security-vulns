Subject: CVE-2025-68798: perf/x86/amd: Check event before enable to avoid GPF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/amd: Check event before enable to avoid GPF

On AMD machines cpuc->events[idx] can become NULL in a subtle race
condition with NMI->throttle->x86_pmu_stop().

Check event for NULL in amd_pmu_enable_all() before enable to avoid a GPF.
This appears to be an AMD only issue.

Syzkaller reported a GPF in amd_pmu_enable_all.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
