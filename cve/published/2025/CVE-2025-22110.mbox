Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: Initialize ctx to avoid memory allocation error

It is possible that ctx in nfqnl_build_packet_message() could be used
before it is properly initialize, which is only initialized
by nfqnl_get_sk_secctx().

This patch corrects this problem by initializing the lsmctx to a safe
value when it is declared.

This is similar to the commit 35fcac7a7c25
("audit: Initialize lsmctx to avoid memory allocation error").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddbf7e1d82a1d0c1d3425931a6cb1b83f8454759
