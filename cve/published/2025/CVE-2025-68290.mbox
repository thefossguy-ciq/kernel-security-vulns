Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

most: usb: fix double free on late probe failure

The MOST subsystem has a non-standard registration function which frees
the interface on registration failures and on deregistration.

This unsurprisingly leads to bugs in the MOST drivers, and a couple of
recent changes turned a reference underflow and use-after-free in the
USB driver into several double free and a use-after-free on late probe
failures.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68290 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
