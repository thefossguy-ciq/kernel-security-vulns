Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix out-of-bound read in ext4_xattr_inode_dec_ref_all()

There's issue as follows:

Above issue happens as ext4_xattr_delete_inode() isn't check xattr
is valid if xattr is in inode.
To solve above issue call xattr_check_inode() check if xattr if valid
in inode. In fact, we can directly verify in ext4_iget_extra_inode(),
so that there is no divergent verification.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22121 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
