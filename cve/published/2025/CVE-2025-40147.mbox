Subject: CVE-2025-40147: blk-throttle: fix access race during throttle policy activation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-throttle: fix access race during throttle policy activation

On repeated cold boots we occasionally hit a NULL pointer crash in
blk_should_throtl() when throttling is consulted before the throttle
policy is fully enabled for the queue. Checking only q->td != NULL is
insufficient during early initialization, so blkg_to_pd() for the
throttle policy can still return NULL and blkg_to_tg() becomes NULL,
which later gets dereferenced.

 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference

Tighten blk_throtl_activated() to also require that the throttle policy
bit is set on the queue:

  return q->td != NULL &&
         test_bit(blkcg_policy_throtl.plid, q->blkcg_pols);

This prevents blk_should_throtl() from accessing throttle group state
until policy data has been attached to blkgs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a0c394300a7b0c05504596685de8a46707171fc
