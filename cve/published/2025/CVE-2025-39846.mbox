Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pcmcia: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in __iodyn_find_io_region()

In __iodyn_find_io_region(), pcmcia_make_resource() is assigned to
res and used in pci_bus_alloc_resource(). There is a dereference of res
in pci_bus_alloc_resource(), which could lead to a NULL pointer
dereference on failure of pcmcia_make_resource().

Fix this bug by adding a check of res.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39846 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
