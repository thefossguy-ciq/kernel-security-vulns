Subject: CVE-2025-37909: net: lan743x: Fix memleak issue when GSO enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: lan743x: Fix memleak issue when GSO enabled

Always map the `skb` to the LS descriptor. Previously skb was
mapped to EXT descriptor when the number of fragments is zero with
GSO enabled. Mapping the skb to EXT descriptor prevents it from
being freed, leading to a memory leak

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37909 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
