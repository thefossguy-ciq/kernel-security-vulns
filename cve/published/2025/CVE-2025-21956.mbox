Subject: CVE-2025-21956: drm/amd/display: Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Assign normalized_pix_clk when color depth = 14

[WHY & HOW]
A warning message "WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 459 at ... /dc_resource.c:3397
calculate_phy_pix_clks+0xef/0x100 [amdgpu]" occurs because the
display_color_depth == COLOR_DEPTH_141414 is not handled. This is
observed in Radeon RX 6600 XT.

It is fixed by assigning pix_clk * (14 * 3) / 24 - same as the rests.

Also fixes the indentation in get_norm_pix_clk.

(cherry picked from commit 274a87eb389f58eddcbc5659ab0b180b37e92775)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21956 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
