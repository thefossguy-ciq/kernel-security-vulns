Subject: CVE-2025-40361: fs: ext4: change GFP_KERNEL to GFP_NOFS to avoid deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: ext4: change GFP_KERNEL to GFP_NOFS to avoid deadlock

The parent function ext4_xattr_inode_lookup_create already uses GFP_NOFS for memory alloction, so the function ext4_xattr_inode_cache_find should use same gfp_flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40361 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
