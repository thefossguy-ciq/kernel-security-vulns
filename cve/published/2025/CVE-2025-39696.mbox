Subject: CVE-2025-39696: ALSA: hda: tas2781: Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: tas2781: Fix wrong reference of tasdevice_priv

During the conversion to unify the calibration data management, the
reference to tasdevice_priv was wrongly set to h->hda_priv instead of
h->priv.  This resulted in memory corruption and crashes eventually.
Unfortunately it's a void pointer, hence the compiler couldn't know
that it's wrong.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39696 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2812815aa79637d39d4398ecd7e58f65d1c79231
