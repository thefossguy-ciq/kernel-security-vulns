Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix memory leak in aRFS after reset

Fix aRFS (accelerated Receive Flow Steering) structures memory leak by
adding a checker to verify if aRFS memory is already allocated while
configuring VSI. aRFS objects are allocated in two cases:
- as part of VSI initialization (at probe), and
- as part of reset handling

However, VSI reconfiguration executed during reset involves memory
allocation one more time, without prior releasing already allocated
resources. This led to the memory leak with the following signature:

[root@os-delivery ~]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
unreferenced object 0xff3c1ca7252e6000 (size 8192):
  comm "kworker/0:0", pid 8, jiffies 4296833052

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
