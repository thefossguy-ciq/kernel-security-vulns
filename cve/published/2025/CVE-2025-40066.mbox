Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7996: Check phy before init msta_link in mt7996_mac_sta_add_links()

In order to avoid a possible NULL pointer dereference in
mt7996_mac_sta_init_link routine, move the phy pointer check before
running mt7996_mac_sta_init_link() in mt7996_mac_sta_add_links routine.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40066 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e671536c1c3c7bcad95d408a4ab42e2e54d1882
