Subject: CVE-2025-68761: hfs: fix potential use after free in hfs_correct_next_unused_CNID()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfs: fix potential use after free in hfs_correct_next_unused_CNID()

This code calls hfs_bnode_put(node) which drops the refcount and then
dreferences "node" on the next line.  It's only safe to use "node"
when we're holding a reference so flip these two lines around.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68761 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
