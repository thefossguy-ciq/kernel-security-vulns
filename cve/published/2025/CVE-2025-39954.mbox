Subject: CVE-2025-39954: clk: sunxi-ng: mp: Fix dual-divider clock rate readback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: mp: Fix dual-divider clock rate readback

When dual-divider clock support was introduced, the P divider offset was
left out of the .recalc_rate readback function. This causes the clock
rate to become bogus or even zero (possibly due to the P divider being
1, leading to a divide-by-zero).

Fix this by incorporating the P divider offset into the calculation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/40108f69c372af3aea73e7829d6849a44638d662
