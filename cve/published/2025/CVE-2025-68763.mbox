Subject: CVE-2025-68763: crypto: starfive - Correctly handle return of sg_nents_for_len

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: starfive - Correctly handle return of sg_nents_for_len

The return value of sg_nents_for_len was assigned to an unsigned long
in starfive_hash_digest, causing negative error codes to be converted
to large positive integers.

Add error checking for sg_nents_for_len and return immediately on
failure to prevent potential buffer overflows.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68763 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
