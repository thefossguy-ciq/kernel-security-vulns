Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: af_alg - Set merge to zero early in af_alg_sendmsg

If an error causes af_alg_sendmsg to abort, ctx->merge may contain
a garbage value from the previous loop.  This may then trigger a
crash on the next entry into af_alg_sendmsg when it attempts to do
a merge that can't be done.

Fix this by setting ctx->merge to zero near the start of the loop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39931 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
