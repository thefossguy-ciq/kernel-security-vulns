Subject: CVE-2025-71231: crypto: iaa - Fix out-of-bounds index in find_empty_iaa_compression_mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: iaa - Fix out-of-bounds index in find_empty_iaa_compression_mode

The local variable 'i' is initialized with -EINVAL, but the for loop
immediately overwrites it and -EINVAL is never returned.

If no empty compression mode can be found, the function would return the
out-of-bounds index IAA_COMP_MODES_MAX, which would cause an invalid
array access in add_iaa_compression_mode().

Fix both issues by returning either a valid index or -EINVAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71231 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
