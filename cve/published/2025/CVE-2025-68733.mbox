Subject: CVE-2025-68733: smack: fix bug: unprivileged task can create labels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smack: fix bug: unprivileged task can create labels

If an unprivileged task is allowed to relabel itself
(/smack/relabel-self is not empty),
it can freely create new labels by writing their
names into own /proc/PID/attr/smack/current

This occurs because do_setattr() imports
the provided label in advance,
before checking "relabel-self" list.

This change ensures that the "relabel-self" list
is checked before importing the label.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68733 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
