Subject: CVE-2025-68781: usb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal

The delayed work item otg_event is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and
scheduled under two conditions:
1. When a host controller binds to the OTG controller.
2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).

A race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove():
the fsl_otg instance may be freed while the delayed work is still pending
or executing. This leads to use-after-free when the work function
fsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.

The problematic scenario:

(detach thread)            | (delayed work)
fsl_otg_remove()           |
  kfree(fsl_otg_dev) //FREE| fsl_otg_event()
                           |   og = container_of(...) //USE
                           |   og-> //USE

Fix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove()
before deallocating the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work
is properly canceled and completes execution prior to memory deallocation.

This bug was identified through static analysis.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68781 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
