Subject: CVE-2025-71227: wifi: mac80211: don't WARN for connections on invalid channels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: don't WARN for connections on invalid channels

It's not clear (to me) how exactly syzbot managed to hit this,
but it seems conceivable that e.g. regulatory changed and has
disabled a channel between scanning (channel is checked to be
usable by cfg80211_get_ies_channel_number) and connecting on
the channel later.

With one scenario that isn't covered elsewhere described above,
the warning isn't good, replace it with a (more informative)
error message.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
