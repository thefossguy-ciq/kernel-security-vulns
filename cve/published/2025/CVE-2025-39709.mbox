Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: protect against spurious interrupts during probe

Make sure the interrupt handler is initialized before the interrupt is
registered.

If the IRQ is registered before hfi_create(), it's possible that an
interrupt fires before the handler setup is complete, leading to a NULL
dereference.

This error condition has been observed during system boot on Rb3Gen2.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39709 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
