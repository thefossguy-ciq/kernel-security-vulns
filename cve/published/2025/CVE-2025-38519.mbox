Subject: CVE-2025-38519: mm/damon: fix divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon: fix divide by zero in damon_get_intervals_score()

The current implementation allows having zero size regions with no special
reasons, but damon_get_intervals_score() gets crashed by divide by zero
when the region size is zero.

  [   29.403950] Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI

This patch fixes the bug, but does not disallow zero size regions to keep
the backward compatibility since disallowing zero size regions might be a
breaking change for some users.

In addition, the same crash can happen when intervals_goal.access_bp is
zero so this should be fixed in stable trees as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38519 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
