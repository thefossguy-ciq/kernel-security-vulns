Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock

Delete the attempt to progress the queue when checking if fence is
signaled. This avoids deadlock.

dma-fence_ops::signaled can be called with the fence lock in unknown
state. For radeon, the fence lock is also the wait queue lock. This can
cause a self deadlock when signaled() tries to make forward progress on
the wait queue. But advancing the queue is unneeded because incorrectly
returning false from signaled() is perfectly acceptable.

(cherry picked from commit 527ba26e50ec2ca2be9c7c82f3ad42998a75d0db)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68223 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73bc12d6a547f9571ce4393acfd73c004e2df9e5
