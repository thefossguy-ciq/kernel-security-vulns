Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer deference in try_to_register_card

In try_to_register_card(), the return value of usb_ifnum_to_if() is
passed directly to usb_interface_claimed() without a NULL check, which
will lead to a NULL pointer dereference when creating an invalid
USB audio device. Fix this by adding a check to ensure the interface
pointer is valid before passing it to usb_interface_claimed().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
