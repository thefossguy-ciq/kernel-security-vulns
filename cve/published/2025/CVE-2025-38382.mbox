Subject: CVE-2025-38382: btrfs: fix iteration of extrefs during log replay

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix iteration of extrefs during log replay

At __inode_add_ref() when processing extrefs, if we jump into the next
label we have an undefined value of victim_name.len, since we haven't
initialized it before we did the goto. This results in an invalid memory
access in the next iteration of the loop since victim_name.len was not
initialized to the length of the name of the current extref.

Fix this by initializing victim_name.len with the current extref's name
length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38382 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
