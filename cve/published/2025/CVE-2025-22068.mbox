Subject: CVE-2025-22068: ublk: make sure ubq->canceling is set when queue is frozen

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: make sure ubq->canceling is set when queue is frozen

Now ublk driver depends on `ubq->canceling` for deciding if the request
can be dispatched via uring_cmd & io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task().

Once ubq->canceling is set, the uring_cmd can be done via ublk_cancel_cmd()
and io_uring_cmd_done().

So set ubq->canceling when queue is frozen, this way makes sure that the
flag can be observed from ublk_queue_rq() reliably, and avoids
use-after-free on uring_cmd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
