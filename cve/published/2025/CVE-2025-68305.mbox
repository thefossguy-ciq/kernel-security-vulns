Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sock: Prevent race in socket write iter and sock bind

There is a potential race condition between sock bind and socket write
iter. bind may free the same cmd via mgmt_pending before write iter sends
the cmd, just as syzbot reported in UAF[1].

Here we use hci_dev_lock to synchronize the two, thereby avoiding the
UAF mentioned in [1].

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
