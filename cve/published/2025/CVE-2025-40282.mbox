Subject: CVE-2025-40282: Bluetooth: 6lowpan: reset link-local header on ipv6 recv path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: 6lowpan: reset link-local header on ipv6 recv path

Bluetooth 6lowpan.c netdev has header_ops, so it must set link-local
header for RX skb, otherwise things crash, eg. with AF_PACKET SOCK_RAW

Add missing skb_reset_mac_header() for uncompressed ipv6 RX path.

For the compressed one, it is done in lowpan_header_decompress().

Log: (BlueZ 6lowpan-tester Client Recv Raw - Success)

kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:212!

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
