Subject: CVE-2025-68802: drm/xe: Limit num_syncs to prevent oversized allocations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Limit num_syncs to prevent oversized allocations

The exec and vm_bind ioctl allow userspace to specify an arbitrary
num_syncs value. Without bounds checking, a very large num_syncs
can force an excessively large allocation, leading to kernel warnings
from the page allocator as below.

Introduce DRM_XE_MAX_SYNCS (set to 1024) and reject any request
exceeding this limit.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
