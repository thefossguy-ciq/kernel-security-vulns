Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tegra: Add call to put_pid()

Add a call to put_pid() corresponding to get_task_pid().
host1x_memory_context_alloc() does not take ownership of the PID so we
need to free it here to avoid leaking.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
