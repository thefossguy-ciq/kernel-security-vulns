Subject: CVE-2025-38059: btrfs: avoid NULL pointer dereference if no valid csum tree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: avoid NULL pointer dereference if no valid csum tree

[BUG]
When trying read-only scrub on a btrfs with rescue=idatacsums mount
option, it will crash with the following call trace:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000208
  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page

[CAUSE]
Mount option "rescue=idatacsums" will completely skip loading the csum
tree, so that any data read will not find any data csum thus we will
ignore data checksum verification.

Normally call sites utilizing csum tree will check the fs state flag
NO_DATA_CSUMS bit, but unfortunately scrub does not check that bit at all.

This results in scrub to call btrfs_search_slot() on a NULL pointer
and triggered above crash.

[FIX]
Check both extent and csum tree root before doing any tree search.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38059 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
