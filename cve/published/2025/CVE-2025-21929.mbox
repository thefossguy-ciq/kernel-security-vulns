Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()

During the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid` driver, a
use-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function.
The function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(),
which can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the
removal process.

Call Trace:
 ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220 [intel_ishtp]

 ...

Additionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should
occur before the ISHTP level disconnect.

This patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in
hid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now
called before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c677fe859a73f5dd3dd84c27f99e10d28047c73
