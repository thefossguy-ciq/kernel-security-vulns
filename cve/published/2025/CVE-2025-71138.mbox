Subject: CVE-2025-71138: drm/msm/dpu: Add missing NULL pointer check for pingpong interface

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Add missing NULL pointer check for pingpong interface

It is checked almost always in dpu_encoder_phys_wb_setup_ctl(), but in a
single place the check is missing.
Also use convenient locals instead of phys_enc->* where available.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/693860/

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
