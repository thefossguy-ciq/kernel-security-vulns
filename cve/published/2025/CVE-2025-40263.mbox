Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: cros_ec_keyb - fix an invalid memory access

If cros_ec_keyb_register_matrix() isn't called (due to
`buttons_switches_only`) in cros_ec_keyb_probe(), `ckdev->idev` remains
NULL.  An invalid memory access is observed in cros_ec_keyb_process()
when receiving an EC_MKBP_EVENT_KEY_MATRIX event in cros_ec_keyb_work()
in such case.

  Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 0000000000000028
  ...
  x3 : 0000000000000000 x2 : 0000000000000000
  x1 : 0000000000000000 x0 : 0000000000000000
  Call trace:
  input_event
  cros_ec_keyb_work
  blocking_notifier_call_chain
  ec_irq_thread

It's still unknown about why the kernel receives such malformed event,
in any cases, the kernel shouldn't access `ckdev->idev` and friends if
the driver doesn't intend to initialize them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40263 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
