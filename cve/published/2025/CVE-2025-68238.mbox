Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: rawnand: cadence: fix DMA device NULL pointer dereference

The DMA device pointer `dma_dev` was being dereferenced before ensuring
that `cdns_ctrl->dmac` is properly initialized.

Move the assignment of `dma_dev` after successfully acquiring the DMA
channel to ensure the pointer is valid before use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68238 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
