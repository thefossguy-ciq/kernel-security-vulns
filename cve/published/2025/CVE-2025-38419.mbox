Subject: CVE-2025-38419: remoteproc: core: Cleanup acquired resources when rproc_handle_resources() fails in rproc_attach()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: core: Cleanup acquired resources when rproc_handle_resources() fails in rproc_attach()

When rproc->state = RPROC_DETACHED and rproc_attach() is used
to attach to the remote processor, if rproc_handle_resources()
returns a failure, the resources allocated by imx_rproc_prepare()
should be released, otherwise the following memory leak will occur.

Since almost the same thing is done in imx_rproc_prepare() and
rproc_resource_cleanup(), Function rproc_resource_cleanup() is able
to deal with empty lists so it is better to fix the "goto" statements
in rproc_attach(). replace the "unprepare_device" goto statement with
"clean_up_resources" and get rid of the "unprepare_device" label.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
