Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: gso: fix ownership in __udp_gso_segment

In __udp_gso_segment the skb destructor is removed before segmenting the
skb but the socket reference is kept as-is. This is an issue if the
original skb is later orphaned as we can hit the following bug:

  kernel BUG at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:3312!  (skb_orphan)
  RIP: 0010:ip_rcv_core+0x8b2/0xca0
  Call Trace:
   ip_rcv+0xab/0x6e0
   __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x168/0x1b0
   process_backlog+0x384/0x1100
   __napi_poll.constprop.0+0xa1/0x370
   net_rx_action+0x925/0xe50

The above can happen following a sequence of events when using
OpenVSwitch, when an OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE action precedes an
OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT action:

1. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE is handled (in do_execute_actions): the skb
   goes through queue_gso_packets and then __udp_gso_segment, where its
   destructor is removed.
2. The segments' data are copied and sent to userspace.
3. OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT is handled (in do_execute_actions) and the
   same original skb is sent to its path.
4. If it later hits skb_orphan, we hit the bug.

Fix this by also removing the reference to the socket in
__udp_gso_segment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21926 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
