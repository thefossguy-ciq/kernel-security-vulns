Subject: CVE-2025-38551: virtio-net: fix recursived rtnl_lock() during probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio-net: fix recursived rtnl_lock() during probe()

The deadlock appears in a stack trace like:

  virtnet_probe()
    rtnl_lock()
    virtio_config_changed_work()
      netdev_notify_peers()
        rtnl_lock()

It happens if the VMM sends a VIRTIO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE request while the
virtio-net driver is still probing.

The config_work in probe() will get scheduled until virtnet_open() enables
the config change notification via virtio_config_driver_enable().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38551 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
