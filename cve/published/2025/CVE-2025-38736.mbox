Subject: CVE-2025-38736: net: usb: asix_devices: Fix PHY address mask in MDIO bus initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix_devices: Fix PHY address mask in MDIO bus initialization

Syzbot reported shift-out-of-bounds exception on MDIO bus initialization.

The PHY address should be masked to 5 bits (0-31). Without this
mask, invalid PHY addresses could be used, potentially causing issues
with MDIO bus operations.

Fix this by masking the PHY address with 0x1f (31 decimal) to ensure
it stays within the valid range.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
