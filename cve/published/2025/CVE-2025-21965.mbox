Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: Validate prev_cpu in scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl()

If a BPF scheduler provides an invalid CPU (outside the nr_cpu_ids
range) as prev_cpu to scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl() it can cause a kernel
crash.

To prevent this, validate prev_cpu in scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl() and
trigger an scx error if an invalid CPU is specified.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21965 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
