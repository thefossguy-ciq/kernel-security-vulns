Subject: CVE-2025-68249: most: usb: hdm_probe: Fix calling put_device() before device initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

most: usb: hdm_probe: Fix calling put_device() before device initialization

The early error path in hdm_probe() can jump to err_free_mdev before
&mdev->dev has been initialized with device_initialize(). Calling
put_device(&mdev->dev) there triggers a device core WARN and ends up
invoking kref_put(&kobj->kref, kobject_release) on an uninitialized
kobject.

In this path the private struct was only kmalloc'ed and the intended
release is effectively kfree(mdev) anyway, so free it directly instead
of calling put_device() on an uninitialized device.

This removes the WARNING and fixes the pre-initialization error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68249 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
