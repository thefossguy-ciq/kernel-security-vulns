Subject: CVE-2025-37883: s390/sclp: Add check for get_zeroed_page()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/sclp: Add check for get_zeroed_page()

Add check for the return value of get_zeroed_page() in
sclp_console_init() to prevent null pointer dereference.
Furthermore, to solve the memory leak caused by the loop
allocation, add a free helper to do the free job.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
