Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: simple-card-utils: Don't use __free(device_node) at graph_util_parse_dai()

commit 419d1918105e ("ASoC: simple-card-utils: use __free(device_node) for
device node") uses __free(device_node) for dlc->of_node, but we need to
keep it while driver is in use.

Don't use __free(device_node) in graph_util_parse_dai().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/232a32e8a7e9be8a2ee238df9b5304eed2f4e195
