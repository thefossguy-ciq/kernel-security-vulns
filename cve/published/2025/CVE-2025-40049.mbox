Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: fix uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent

Syzkaller reports a "KMSAN: uninit-value in squashfs_get_parent" bug.

This is caused by open_by_handle_at() being called with a file handle
containing an invalid parent inode number.  In particular the inode number
is that of a symbolic link, rather than a directory.

Squashfs_get_parent() gets called with that symbolic link inode, and
accesses the parent member field.

	unsigned int parent_ino = squashfs_i(inode)->parent;

Because non-directory inodes in Squashfs do not have a parent value, this
is uninitialised, and this causes an uninitialised value access.

The fix is to initialise parent with the invalid inode 0, which will cause
an EINVAL error to be returned.

Regular inodes used to share the parent field with the block_list_start
field.  This is removed in this commit to enable the parent field to
contain the invalid inode number 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
