Subject: CVE-2025-71108: usb: typec: ucsi: Handle incorrect num_connectors capability

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: Handle incorrect num_connectors capability

The UCSI spec states that the num_connectors field is 7 bits, and the
8th bit is reserved and should be set to zero.
Some buggy FW has been known to set this bit, and it can lead to a
system not booting.
Flag that the FW is not behaving correctly, and auto-fix the value
so that the system boots correctly.

Found on Lenovo P1 G8 during Linux enablement program. The FW will
be fixed, but seemed worth addressing in case it hit platforms that
aren't officially Linux supported.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
