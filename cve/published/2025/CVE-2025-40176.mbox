Subject: CVE-2025-40176: tls: wait for pending async decryptions if tls_strp_msg_hold fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: wait for pending async decryptions if tls_strp_msg_hold fails

Async decryption calls tls_strp_msg_hold to create a clone of the
input skb to hold references to the memory it uses. If we fail to
allocate that clone, proceeding with async decryption can lead to
various issues (UAF on the skb, writing into userspace memory after
the recv() call has returned).

In this case, wait for all pending decryption requests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
