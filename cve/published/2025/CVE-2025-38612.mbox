Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: fbtft: fix potential memory leak in fbtft_framebuffer_alloc()

In the error paths after fb_info structure is successfully allocated,
the memory allocated in fb_deferred_io_init() for info->pagerefs is not
freed. Fix that by adding the cleanup function on the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38612 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
