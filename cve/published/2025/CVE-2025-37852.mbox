Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: handle amdgpu_cgs_create_device() errors in amd_powerplay_create()

Add error handling to propagate amdgpu_cgs_create_device() failures
to the caller. When amdgpu_cgs_create_device() fails, release hwmgr
and return -ENOMEM to prevent null pointer dereference.

[v1]->[v2]: Change error code from -EINVAL to -ENOMEM. Free hwmgr.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37852 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
