Subject: CVE-2025-40232: rv: Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rv: Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator

The callbacks in enabled_monitors_seq_ops are inconsistent. Some treat the
iterator as struct rv_monitor *, while others treat the iterator as struct
list_head *.

This causes a wrong type cast and crashes the system as reported by Nathan.

Convert everything to use struct list_head * as iterator. This also makes
enabled_monitors consistent with available_monitors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40232 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
