Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: Fix host hang issue during device reboot

When the host loses heartbeat messages from the device,
the driver calls the device-specific ndo_stop function,
which frees the resources. If the driver is unloaded in
this scenario, it calls ndo_stop again, attempting to free
resources that have already been freed, leading to a host
hang issue. To resolve this, dev_close should be called
instead of the device-specific stop function.dev_close
internally calls ndo_stop to stop the network interface
and performs additional cleanup tasks. During the driver
unload process, if the device is already down, ndo_stop
is not called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37933 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
