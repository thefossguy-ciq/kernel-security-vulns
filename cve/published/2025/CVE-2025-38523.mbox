Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix the smbd_response slab to allow usercopy

The handling of received data in the smbdirect client code involves using
copy_to_iter() to copy data from the smbd_reponse struct's packet trailer
to a folioq buffer provided by netfslib that encapsulates a chunk of
pagecache.

If, however, CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y, this will result in the checks
then performed in copy_to_iter() oopsing with something like the following:

 CIFS: Attempting to mount //172.31.9.1/test
 CIFS: VFS: RDMA transport established
 usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'smbd_response_0000000091e24ea1' (offset 81, size 63)!

 RIP: 0010:usercopy_abort+0x6c/0x80

 Call Trace:

The problem is that the smbd_response slab's packet field isn't marked as
being permitted for usercopy.

Fix this by passing parameters to kmem_slab_create() to indicate that
copy_to_iter() is permitted from the packet region of the smbd_response
slab objects, less the header space.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38523 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87dcc7e33fc3dcb8ed32333cec016528b5bb6ce4
