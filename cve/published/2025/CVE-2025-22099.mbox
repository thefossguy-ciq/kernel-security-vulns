Subject: CVE-2025-22099: drm: xlnx: zynqmp_dpsub: Add NULL check in zynqmp_audio_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: xlnx: zynqmp_dpsub: Add NULL check in zynqmp_audio_init

devm_kasprintf() calls can return null pointers on failure.
But some return values were not checked in zynqmp_audio_init().

Add NULL check in zynqmp_audio_init(), avoid referencing null
pointers in the subsequent code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22099 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
