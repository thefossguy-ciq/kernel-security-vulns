Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: server: split ksmbd_rdma_stop_listening() out of ksmbd_rdma_destroy()

We can't call destroy_workqueue(smb_direct_wq); before stop_sessions()!

Otherwise already existing connections try to use smb_direct_wq as
a NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39692 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
