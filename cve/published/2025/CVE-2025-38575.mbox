Subject: CVE-2025-38575: ksmbd: use aead_request_free to match aead_request_alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: use aead_request_free to match aead_request_alloc

Use aead_request_free() instead of kfree() to properly free memory
allocated by aead_request_alloc(). This ensures sensitive crypto data
is zeroed before being freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38575 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
