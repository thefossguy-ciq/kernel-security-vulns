Subject: CVE-2025-40308: Bluetooth: bcsp: receive data only if registered

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: bcsp: receive data only if registered

Currently, bcsp_recv() can be called even when the BCSP protocol has not
been registered. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference, as shown in
the following stack trace:

    KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000108-0x000000000000010f]
    RIP: 0010:bcsp_recv+0x13d/0x1740 drivers/bluetooth/hci_bcsp.c:590
    Call Trace:

     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f

To prevent this, ensure that the HCI_UART_REGISTERED flag is set before
processing received data. If the protocol is not registered, return
-EUNATCH.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40308 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
