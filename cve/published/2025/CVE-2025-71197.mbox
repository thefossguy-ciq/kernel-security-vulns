Subject: CVE-2025-71197: w1: therm: Fix off-by-one buffer overflow in alarms_store

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

w1: therm: Fix off-by-one buffer overflow in alarms_store

The sysfs buffer passed to alarms_store() is allocated with 'size + 1'
bytes and a NUL terminator is appended. However, the 'size' argument
does not account for this extra byte. The original code then allocated
'size' bytes and used strcpy() to copy 'buf', which always writes one
byte past the allocated buffer since strcpy() copies until the NUL
terminator at index 'size'.

Fix this by parsing the 'buf' parameter directly using simple_strtoll()
without allocating any intermediate memory or string copying. This
removes the overflow while simplifying the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
