Subject: CVE-2025-68743: mshv: Fix create memory region overlap check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mshv: Fix create memory region overlap check

The current check is incorrect; it only checks if the beginning or end
of a region is within an existing region. This doesn't account for
userspace specifying a region that begins before and ends after an
existing region.

Change the logic to a range intersection check against gfns and uaddrs
for each region.

Remove mshv_partition_region_by_uaddr() as it is no longer used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68743 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
