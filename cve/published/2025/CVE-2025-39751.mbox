Subject: CVE-2025-39751: ALSA: hda/ca0132: Fix buffer overflow in add_tuning_control

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda/ca0132: Fix buffer overflow in add_tuning_control

The 'sprintf' call in 'add_tuning_control' may exceed the 44-byte
buffer if either string argument is too long. This triggers a compiler
warning.
Replaced 'sprintf' with 'snprintf' to limit string lengths to prevent
overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39751 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
