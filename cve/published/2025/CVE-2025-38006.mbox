Subject: CVE-2025-38006: net: mctp: Don't access ifa_index when missing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: Don't access ifa_index when missing

In mctp_dump_addrinfo, ifa_index can be used to filter interfaces, but
only when the struct ifaddrmsg is provided. Otherwise it will be
comparing to uninitialised memory - reproducible in the syzkaller case from
dhcpd, or busybox "ip addr show".

The kernel MCTP implementation has always filtered by ifa_index, so
existing userspace programs expecting to dump MCTP addresses must
already be passing a valid ifa_index value (either 0 or a real index).

BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in mctp_dump_addrinfo+0x208/0xac0 net/mctp/device.c:128

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
