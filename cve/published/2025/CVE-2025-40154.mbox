Subject: CVE-2025-40154: ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix invalid quirk input mapping

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix invalid quirk input mapping

When an invalid value is passed via quirk option, currently
bytcr_rt5640 driver only shows an error message but leaves as is.
This may lead to unepxected results like OOB access.

This patch corrects the input mapping to the certain default value if
an invalid value is passed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40154 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
