Subject: CVE-2025-38586: bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, arm64: Fix fp initialization for exception boundary

In the ARM64 BPF JIT when prog->aux->exception_boundary is set for a BPF
program, find_used_callee_regs() is not called because for a program
acting as exception boundary, all callee saved registers are saved.
find_used_callee_regs() sets `ctx->fp_used = true;` when it sees FP
being used in any of the instructions.

For programs acting as exception boundary, ctx->fp_used remains false
even if frame pointer is used by the program and therefore, FP is not
set-up for such programs in the prologue. This can cause the kernel to
crash due to a pagefault.

Fix it by setting ctx->fp_used = true for exception boundary programs as
fp is always saved in such programs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38586 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
