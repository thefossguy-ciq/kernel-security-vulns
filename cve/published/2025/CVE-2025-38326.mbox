Subject: CVE-2025-38326: aoe: clean device rq_list in aoedev_downdev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: clean device rq_list in aoedev_downdev()

An aoe device's rq_list contains accepted block requests that are
waiting to be transmitted to the aoe target. This queue was added as
part of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned out
when an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleep
indefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. This
fix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38326 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
