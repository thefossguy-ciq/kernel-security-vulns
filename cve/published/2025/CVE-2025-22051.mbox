Subject: CVE-2025-22051: staging: gpib: Fix Oops after disconnect in agilent usb

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: gpib: Fix Oops after disconnect in agilent usb

If the agilent usb dongle is disconnected subsequent calls to the
driver cause a NULL dereference Oops as the bus_interface
is set to NULL on disconnect.

This problem was introduced by setting usb_dev from the bus_interface
for dev_xxx messages.

Previously bus_interface was checked for NULL only in the functions
directly calling usb_fill_bulk_urb or usb_control_msg.

Check for valid bus_interface on all interface entry points
and return -ENODEV if it is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22051 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
