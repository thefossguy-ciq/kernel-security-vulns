Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: vchiq_arm: Fix possible NPR of keep-alive thread

In case vchiq_platform_conn_state_changed() is never called or fails before
driver removal, ka_thread won't be a valid pointer to a task_struct. So
do the necessary checks before calling kthread_stop to avoid a crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
