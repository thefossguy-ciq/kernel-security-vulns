Subject: CVE-2025-40310: amd/amdkfd: resolve a race in amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amd/amdkfd: resolve a race in amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw

There is race in amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw and interrupt.
if amdgpu_amdkfd_device_fini_sw run in b/w kfd_cleanup_nodes and
  kfree(kfd), and KGD interrupt generated.

kernel panic log:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
