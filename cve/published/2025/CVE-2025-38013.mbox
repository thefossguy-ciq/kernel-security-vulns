Subject: CVE-2025-38013: wifi: mac80211: Set n_channels after allocating struct cfg80211_scan_request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Set n_channels after allocating struct cfg80211_scan_request

Make sure that n_channels is set after allocating the
struct cfg80211_registered_device::int_scan_req member. Seen with
syzkaller:

UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c:1208:5
index 0 is out of range for type 'struct ieee80211_channel *[] __counted_by(n_channels)' (aka 'struct ieee80211_channel *[]')

This was missed in the initial conversions because I failed to locate
the allocation likely due to the "sizeof(void *)" not matching the
"channels" array type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38013 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
