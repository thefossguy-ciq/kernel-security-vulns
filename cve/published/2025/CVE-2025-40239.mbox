Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: micrel: always set shared->phydev for LAN8814

Currently, during the LAN8814 PTP probe shared->phydev is only set if PTP
clock gets actually set, otherwise the function will return before setting
it.

This is an issue as shared->phydev is unconditionally being used when IRQ
is being handled, especially in lan8814_gpio_process_cap and since it was
not set it will cause a NULL pointer exception and crash the kernel.

So, simply always set shared->phydev to avoid the NULL pointer exception.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40239 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
