Subject: CVE-2025-38269: btrfs: exit after state insertion failure at btrfs_convert_extent_bit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: exit after state insertion failure at btrfs_convert_extent_bit()

If insert_state() state failed it returns an error pointer and we call
extent_io_tree_panic() which will trigger a BUG() call. However if
CONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is an uncommon and exotic scenario, then
we fallthrough and call cache_state() which will dereference the error
pointer, resulting in an invalid memory access.

So jump to the 'out' label after calling extent_io_tree_panic(), it also
makes the code more clear besides dealing with the exotic scenario where
CONFIG_BUG is disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
