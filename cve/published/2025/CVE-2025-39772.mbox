Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/hisilicon/hibmc: fix the hibmc loaded failed bug

When hibmc loaded failed, the driver use hibmc_unload to free the
resource, but the mutexes in mode.config are not init, which will
access an NULL pointer. Just change goto statement to return, because
hibnc_hw_init() doesn't need to free anything.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39772 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
