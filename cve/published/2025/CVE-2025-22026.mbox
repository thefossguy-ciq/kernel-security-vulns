Subject: CVE-2025-22026: nfsd: don't ignore the return code of svc_proc_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: don't ignore the return code of svc_proc_register()

Currently, nfsd_proc_stat_init() ignores the return value of
svc_proc_register(). If the procfile creation fails, then the kernel
will WARN when it tries to remove the entry later.

Fix nfsd_proc_stat_init() to return the same type of pointer as
svc_proc_register(), and fix up nfsd_net_init() to check that and fail
the nfsd_net construction if it occurs.

svc_proc_register() can fail if the dentry can't be allocated, or if an
identical dentry already exists. The second case is pretty unlikely in
the nfsd_net construction codepath, so if this happens, return -ENOMEM.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22026 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c
	fs/nfsd/stats.c
	fs/nfsd/stats.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
