Subject: CVE-2025-37758: ata: pata_pxa: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in pxa_ata_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: pata_pxa: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in pxa_ata_probe()

devm_ioremap() returns NULL on error. Currently, pxa_ata_probe() does
not check for this case, which can result in a NULL pointer dereference.

Add NULL check after devm_ioremap() to prevent this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37758 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
