Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix oops in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.

I saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running the xe-fast-feedback
testlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.

The panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes.
Presumably what happens is that a process mmaps, unlocks because
of the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory left,
causing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since
there was nothing left to populate, and then oopses in
"mem_type_is_vram(tbo->resource->mem_type)" because tbo->resource
is NULL.

It's convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after
the test exits.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40340 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/99428bd6123d5676209dfb1d7a8f176cc830b665
