Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

openvswitch: Fix unsafe attribute parsing in output_userspace()

This patch replaces the manual Netlink attribute iteration in
output_userspace() with nla_for_each_nested(), which ensures that only
well-formed attributes are processed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37998 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
