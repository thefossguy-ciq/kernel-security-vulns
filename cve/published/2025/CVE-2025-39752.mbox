Subject: CVE-2025-39752: ARM: rockchip: fix kernel hang during smp initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: rockchip: fix kernel hang during smp initialization

In order to bring up secondary CPUs main CPU write trampoline
code to SRAM. The trampoline code is written while secondary
CPUs are powered on (at least that true for RK3188 CPU).
Sometimes that leads to kernel hang. Probably because secondary
CPU execute trampoline code while kernel doesn't expect.

The patch moves SRAM initialization step to the point where all
secondary CPUs are powered down.

That fixes rarely hangs on RK3188:
[    0.091568] CPU0: thread -1, cpu 0, socket 0, mpidr 80000000
[    0.091996] rockchip_smp_prepare_cpus: ncores 4

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39752 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
