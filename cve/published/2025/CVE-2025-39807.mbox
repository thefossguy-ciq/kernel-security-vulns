Subject: CVE-2025-39807: drm/mediatek: Add error handling for old state CRTC in atomic_disable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Add error handling for old state CRTC in atomic_disable

Introduce error handling to address an issue where, after a hotplug
event, the cursor continues to update. This situation can lead to a
kernel panic due to accessing the NULL `old_state->crtc`.

E,g.
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

Adding NULL pointer checks to ensure stability by preventing operations
on an invalid CRTC state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39807 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d5cc22efa44e0fe321ce195c71c3d7da211fbb2
