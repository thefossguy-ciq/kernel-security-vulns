Subject: CVE-2025-71136: media: adv7842: Avoid possible out-of-bounds array accesses in adv7842_cp_log_status()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: adv7842: Avoid possible out-of-bounds array accesses in adv7842_cp_log_status()

It's possible for cp_read() and hdmi_read() to return -EIO. Those
values are further used as indexes for accessing arrays.

Fix that by checking return values where it's needed.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71136 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
