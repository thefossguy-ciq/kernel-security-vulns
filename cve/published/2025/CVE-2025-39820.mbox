Subject: CVE-2025-39820: drm/msm/dpu: Add a null ptr check for dpu_encoder_needs_modeset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Add a null ptr check for dpu_encoder_needs_modeset

The drm_atomic_get_new_connector_state() can return NULL if the
connector is not part of the atomic state. Add a check to prevent
a NULL pointer dereference.

This follows the same pattern used in dpu_encoder_update_topology()
within the same file, which checks for NULL before using conn_state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39820 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aaec54254b02f5959c3670177037464d828b2140
