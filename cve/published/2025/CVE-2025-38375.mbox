Subject: CVE-2025-38375: virtio-net: ensure the received length does not exceed allocated size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio-net: ensure the received length does not exceed allocated size

In xdp_linearize_page, when reading the following buffers from the ring,
we forget to check the received length with the true allocate size. This
can lead to an out-of-bound read. This commit adds that missing check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38375 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
