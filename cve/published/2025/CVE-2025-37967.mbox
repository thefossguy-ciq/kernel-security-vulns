Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix deadlock

This patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock
functions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector
mutex is only locked if a connection is established and the partner pointer
is valid. This resolves a deadlock scenario where
ucsi_displayport_remove_partner holds con->mutex waiting for
dp_altmode_work to complete while dp_altmode_work attempts to acquire it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37967 to this issue.

	drivers/usb/typec/ucsi/ucsi.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/61fc1a8e1e10cc784cab5829930838aaf1d37af5
