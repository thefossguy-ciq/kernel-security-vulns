Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

svcrdma: bound check rq_pages index in inline path

svc_rdma_copy_inline_range indexed rqstp->rq_pages[rc_curpage] without
verifying rc_curpage stays within the allocated page array. Add guards
before the first use and after advancing to a new page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
