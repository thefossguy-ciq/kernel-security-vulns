Subject: CVE-2025-40093: usb: gadget: f_ecm: Refactor bind path to use __free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_ecm: Refactor bind path to use __free()

After an bind/unbind cycle, the ecm->notify_req is left stale. If a
subsequent bind fails, the unified error label attempts to free this
stale request, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing
ep->ops->free_request.

Refactor the error handling in the bind path to use the __free()
automatic cleanup mechanism.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40093 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
