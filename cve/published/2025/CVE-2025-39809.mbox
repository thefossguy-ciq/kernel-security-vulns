Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: intel-thc-hid: intel-quicki2c: Fix ACPI dsd ICRS/ISUB length

The QuickI2C ACPI _DSD methods return ICRS and ISUB data with a
trailing byte, making the actual length is one more byte than the
structs defined.

It caused stack-out-of-bounds and kernel crash:

kernel: BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in quicki2c_acpi_get_dsd_property.constprop.0+0x111/0x1b0 [intel_quicki2c]

ACPI DSD methods return:

\_SB.PC00.THC0.ICRS Buffer       000000003fdc947b 001 Len 0C = 0A 00 80 1A 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Adding reserved padding to quicki2c_subip_acpi_parameter/config.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39809 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4adce86d4b13d15dec7810967839b931b1598700
