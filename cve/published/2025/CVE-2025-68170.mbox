Subject: CVE-2025-68170: drm/radeon: Do not kfree() devres managed rdev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: Do not kfree() devres managed rdev

Since the allocation of the drivers main structure was changed to
devm_drm_dev_alloc() rdev is managed by devres and we shouldn't be calling
kfree() on it.

This fixes things exploding if the driver probe fails and devres cleans up
the rdev after we already free'd it.

(cherry picked from commit 16c0681617b8a045773d4d87b6140002fa75b03b)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68170 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
