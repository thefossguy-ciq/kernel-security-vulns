Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netdev: prevent accessing NAPI instances from another namespace

The NAPI IDs were not fully exposed to user space prior to the netlink
API, so they were never namespaced. The netlink API must ensure that
at the very least NAPI instance belongs to the same netns as the owner
of the genl sock.

napi_by_id() can become static now, but it needs to move because of
dev_get_by_napi_id().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21659 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b683ba0df11ff563cc237eb1b74d6adfa77226bf
