Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tls: fix kernel panic when alloc_page failed

We cannot set frag_list to NULL pointer when alloc_page failed.
It will be used in tls_strp_check_queue_ok when the next time
tls_strp_read_sock is called.

This is because we don't reset full_len in tls_strp_flush_anchor_copy()
so the recv path will try to continue handling the partial record
on the next call but we dettached the rcvq from the frag list.
Alternative fix would be to reset full_len.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
at virtual address 0000000000000028
 Call trace:
 tls_strp_check_rcv+0x128/0x27c
 tls_strp_data_ready+0x34/0x44
 tls_data_ready+0x3c/0x1f0

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38018 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
