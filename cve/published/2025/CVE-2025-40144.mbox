Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvdimm: ndtest: Return -ENOMEM if devm_kcalloc() fails in ndtest_probe()

devm_kcalloc() may fail. ndtest_probe() allocates three DMA address
arrays (dcr_dma, label_dma, dimm_dma) and later unconditionally uses
them in ndtest_nvdimm_init(), which can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference under low-memory conditions.

Check all three allocations and return -ENOMEM if any allocation fails,
jumping to the common error path. Do not emit an extra error message
since the allocator already warns on allocation failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40144 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
