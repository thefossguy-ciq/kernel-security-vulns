Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rw: ensure allocated iovec gets cleared for early failure

A previous commit reused the recyling infrastructure for early cleanup,
but this is not enough for the case where our internal caches have
overflowed. If this happens, then the allocated iovec can get leaked if
the request is also aborted early.

Reinstate the previous forced free of the iovec for that situation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40267 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/094c6467fe05e0de618c5a7fcff4d3ee20aeaef8
