Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Affirm IDR0.CCTW on apps_smmu"

There are reports that the pagetable walker cache coherency is not a
given across the spectrum of SDM845/850 devices, leading to lock-ups
and resets. It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c,
but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).

This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where
likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate
for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which
often serves as a baseline for products).

Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.

This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22012 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845.dtsi


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e6e9fc90258a318d30b417bcccda908bb82ee9d
