Subject: CVE-2025-38518: x86/CPU/AMD: Disable INVLPGB on Zen2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Disable INVLPGB on Zen2

AMD Cyan Skillfish (Family 17h, Model 47h, Stepping 0h) has an issue
that causes system oopses and panics when performing TLB flush using
INVLPGB.

However, the problem is that that machine has misconfigured CPUID and
should not report the INVLPGB bit in the first place. So zap the
kernel's representation of the flag so that nothing gets confused.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/357f121517924e3ec3021f9d0dd0189adcd09867
