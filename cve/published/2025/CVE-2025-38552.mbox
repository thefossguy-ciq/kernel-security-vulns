Subject: CVE-2025-38552: mptcp: plug races between subflow fail and subflow creation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: plug races between subflow fail and subflow creation

We have races similar to the one addressed by the previous patch between
subflow failing and additional subflow creation. They are just harder to
trigger.

The solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition
'socket state prevent any additional subflow creation' protected by the
fallback lock.

The socket fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sending
an MP_FAIL option.

The field 'allow_infinite_fallback' is now always touched under the
relevant lock, we can drop the ONCE annotation on write.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38552 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
