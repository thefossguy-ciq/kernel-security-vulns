Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix regression with native SMB symlinks

Some users and customers reported that their backup/copy tools started
to fail when the directory being copied contained symlink targets that
the client couldn't parse - even when those symlinks weren't followed.

Fix this by allowing lstat(2) and readlink(2) to succeed even when the
client can't resolve the symlink target, restoring old behavior.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38431 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ddaf7567080c7de2e0c99efca2ee1e6b79beea5
