Subject: CVE-2025-68203: drm/amdgpu: fix lock warning in amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix lock warning in amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process

Fix a potential deadlock caused by inconsistent spinlock usage
between interrupt and process contexts in the userq fence driver.

The issue occurs when amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process() is called
from both:
- Interrupt context: gfx_v11_0_eop_irq() -> amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()
- Process context: amdgpu_eviction_fence_suspend_worker() ->
  amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_force_completion() -> amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()

In interrupt context, the spinlock was acquired without disabling
interrupts, leaving it in {IN-HARDIRQ-W} state. When the same lock
is acquired in process context, the kernel detects inconsistent
locking since the process context acquisition would enable interrupts
while holding a lock previously acquired in interrupt context.

Kernel log shows:
[ 4039.310790] inconsistent {IN-HARDIRQ-W} -> {HARDIRQ-ON-W} usage.
[ 4039.310804] kworker/7:2/409 [HC0[0]:SC0[0]:HE1:SE1] takes:
[ 4039.310818] ffff9284e1bed000 (&fence_drv->fence_list_lock){?...}-{3:3},
[ 4039.310993] {IN-HARDIRQ-W} state was registered at:
[ 4039.311004]   lock_acquire+0xc6/0x300
[ 4039.311018]   _raw_spin_lock+0x39/0x80

[ 4039.311257]   gfx_v11_0_eop_irq+0x132/0x170 [amdgpu]

Fix by using spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore() to properly
manage interrupt state regardless of calling context.

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_userq_fence.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ad70a06d7e91c378b346a3718c81abb50a74b74
