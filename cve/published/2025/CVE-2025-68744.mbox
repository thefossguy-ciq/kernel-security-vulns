Subject: CVE-2025-68744: bpf: Free special fields when update [lru_,]percpu_hash maps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Free special fields when update [lru_,]percpu_hash maps

As [lru_,]percpu_hash maps support BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU}, missing
calls to 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()' could cause the
memory referenced by BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU} fields to be held until the
map gets freed.

Fix this by calling 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' after
'copy_map_value[,_long]()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68744 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
