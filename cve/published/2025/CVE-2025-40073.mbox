Subject: CVE-2025-40073: drm/msm: Do not validate SSPP when it is not ready

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Do not validate SSPP when it is not ready

Current code will validate current plane and previous plane to
confirm they can share a SSPP with multi-rect mode. The SSPP
is already allocated for previous plane, while current plane
is not associated with any SSPP yet. Null pointer is referenced
when validating the SSPP of current plane. Skip SSPP validation
for current plane.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000020

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1dbb3eedb7db4cad45d2619edb1cce6041f79e3
