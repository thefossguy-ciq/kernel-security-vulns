Subject: CVE-2025-38706: ASoC: core: Check for rtd == NULL in snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: core: Check for rtd == NULL in snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime()

snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() might be called with rtd == NULL which will
leads to null pointer dereference.
This was reproduced with topology loading and marking a link as ignore
due to missing hardware component on the system.
On module removal the soc_tplg_remove_link() would call
snd_soc_remove_pcm_runtime() with rtd == NULL since the link was ignored,
no runtime was created.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38706 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
