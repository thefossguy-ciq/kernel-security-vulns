Subject: CVE-2025-68755: staging: most: remove broken i2c driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: most: remove broken i2c driver

The MOST I2C driver has been completely broken for five years without
anyone noticing so remove the driver from staging.

Specifically, commit 723de0f9171e ("staging: most: remove device from
interface structure") started requiring drivers to set the interface
device pointer before registration, but the I2C driver was never updated
which results in a NULL pointer dereference if anyone ever tries to
probe it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
