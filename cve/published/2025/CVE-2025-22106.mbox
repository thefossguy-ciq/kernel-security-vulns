Subject: CVE-2025-22106: vmxnet3: unregister xdp rxq info in the reset path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmxnet3: unregister xdp rxq info in the reset path

vmxnet3 does not unregister xdp rxq info in the
vmxnet3_reset_work() code path as vmxnet3_rq_destroy()
is not invoked in this code path. So, we get below message with a
backtrace.

Missing unregister, handled but fix driver
WARNING: CPU:48 PID: 500 at net/core/xdp.c:182
__xdp_rxq_info_reg+0x93/0xf0

This patch fixes the problem by moving the unregister
code of XDP from vmxnet3_rq_destroy() to vmxnet3_rq_cleanup().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
