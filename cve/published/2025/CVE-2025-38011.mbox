After process exit to unmap csa and free GPU vm, if signal is accepted
and then waiting to take vm lock is interrupted and return, it causes
memory leaking and below warning backtrace.

Change to use uninterruptible wait lock fix the issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
