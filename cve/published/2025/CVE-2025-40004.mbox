Subject: CVE-2025-40004: net/9p: Fix buffer overflow in USB transport layer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/9p: Fix buffer overflow in USB transport layer

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the USB 9pfs transport layer
where inconsistent size validation between packet header parsing and
actual data copying allows a malicious USB host to overflow heap buffers.

The issue occurs because:
- usb9pfs_rx_header() validates only the declared size in packet header
- usb9pfs_rx_complete() uses req->actual (actual received bytes) for
memcpy

This allows an attacker to craft packets with small declared size
(bypassing validation) but large actual payload (triggering overflow
in memcpy).

Add validation in usb9pfs_rx_complete() to ensure req->actual does not
exceed the buffer capacity before copying data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40004 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0da18d49f874d444ad83c8a546fa33bfcf2f582c
