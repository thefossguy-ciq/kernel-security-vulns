Subject: CVE-2025-22000: mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

When an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF,
folio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all
page cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory
leak.

This leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a
truncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order
ones, causing truncated folios not being freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22000 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
