Subject: CVE-2025-39780: sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switch

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/ext: Fix invalid task state transitions on class switch

When enabling a sched_ext scheduler, we may trigger invalid task state
transitions, resulting in warnings like the following (which can be
easily reproduced by running the hotplug selftest in a loop):

 sched_ext: Invalid task state transition 0 -> 3 for fish[770]
 WARNING: CPU: 18 PID: 787 at kernel/sched/ext.c:3862 scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0
 ...
 RIP: 0010:scx_set_task_state+0x7c/0xc0
 ...
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  scx_enable_task+0x11f/0x2e0

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f

This happens because we skip initialization for tasks that are already
dead (with their usage counter set to zero), but we don't exclude them
during the scheduling class transition phase.

Fix this by also skipping dead tasks during class swiching, preventing
invalid task state transitions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39780 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/786f6314604b34c3e7de5f733f4e08e35c448a50
