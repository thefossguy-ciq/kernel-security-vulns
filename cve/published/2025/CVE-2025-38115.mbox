Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: sch_sfq: fix a potential crash on gso_skb handling

SFQ has an assumption of always being able to queue at least one packet.

However, after the blamed commit, sch->q.len can be inflated by packets
in sch->gso_skb, and an enqueue() on an empty SFQ qdisc can be followed
by an immediate drop.

Fix sfq_drop() to properly clear q->tail in this situation.


ip netns add lb
ip link add dev to-lb type veth peer name in-lb netns lb
ethtool -K to-lb tso off                 # force qdisc to requeue gso_skb
ip netns exec lb ethtool -K in-lb gro on # enable NAPI
ip link set dev to-lb up
ip -netns lb link set dev in-lb up

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
