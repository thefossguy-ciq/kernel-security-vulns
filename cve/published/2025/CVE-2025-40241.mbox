Subject: CVE-2025-40241: erofs: fix crafted invalid cases for encoded extents

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix crafted invalid cases for encoded extents

Robert recently reported two corrupted images that can cause system
crashes, which are related to the new encoded extents introduced
in Linux 6.15:

  - The first one [1] has plen != 0 (e.g. plen == 0x2000000) but
    (plen & Z_EROFS_EXTENT_PLEN_MASK) == 0. It is used to represent
    special extents such as sparse extents (!EROFS_MAP_MAPPED), but
    previously only plen == 0 was handled;

  - The second one [2] has pa 0xffffffffffdcffed and plen 0xb4000,
    then "cur [0xfffffffffffff000] += bvec.bv_len [0x1000]" in
    "} while ((cur += bvec.bv_len) < end);" wraps around, causing an
    out-of-bound access of pcl->compressed_bvecs[] in
    z_erofs_submit_queue().  EROFS only supports 48-bit physical block
    addresses (up to 1EiB for 4k blocks), so add a sanity check to
    enforce this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40241 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00d8fe0b72f4ca0a983abced36aad2160038c421
