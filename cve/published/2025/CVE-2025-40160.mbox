Subject: CVE-2025-40160: xen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs

Change find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a
different CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON()
from bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate the error upwards.

Some VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must
be bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for
per-domain and global will probably fail when migrated off CPU 0,
especially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now returns -EEXIST
instead of BUG_ON().

A second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is not expected, but
make it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don't
know which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40160 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
