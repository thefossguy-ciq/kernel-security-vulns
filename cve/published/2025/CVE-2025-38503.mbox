Subject: CVE-2025-38503: btrfs: fix assertion when building free space tree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix assertion when building free space tree

When building the free space tree with the block group tree feature
enabled, we can hit an assertion failure like this:

  BTRFS info (device loop0 state M): rebuilding free space tree
  assertion failed: ret == 0, in fs/btrfs/free-space-tree.c:1102

This happens because we are processing an empty block group, which has
no extents allocated from it, there are no items for this block group,
including the block group item since block group items are stored in a
dedicated tree when using the block group tree feature. It also means
this is the block group with the highest start offset, so there are no
higher keys in the extent root, hence btrfs_search_slot_for_read()
returns 1 (no higher key found).

Fix this by asserting 'ret' is 0 only if the block group tree feature
is not enabled, in which case we should find a block group item for
the block group since it's stored in the extent root and block group
item keys are greater than extent item keys (the value for
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY is 192 and for BTRFS_EXTENT_ITEM_KEY and
BTRFS_METADATA_ITEM_KEY the values are 168 and 169 respectively).
In case 'ret' is 1, we just need to add a record to the free space
tree which spans the whole block group, and we can achieve this by
making 'ret == 0' as the while loop's condition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38503 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
