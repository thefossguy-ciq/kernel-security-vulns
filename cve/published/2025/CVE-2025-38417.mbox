Subject: CVE-2025-38417: ice: fix eswitch code memory leak in reset scenario

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix eswitch code memory leak in reset scenario

Add simple eswitch mode checker in attaching VF procedure and allocate
required port representor memory structures only in switchdev mode.
The reset flows triggers VF (if present) detach/attach procedure.
It might involve VF port representor(s) re-creation if the device is
configured is switchdev mode (not legacy one).
The memory was blindly allocated in current implementation,
regardless of the mode and not freed if in legacy mode.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
