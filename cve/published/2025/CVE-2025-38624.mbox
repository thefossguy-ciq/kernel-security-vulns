Subject: CVE-2025-38624: PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug

When the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the
pnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges'
hotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.

Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources
before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().

Also modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so
that it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of
pnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will
now be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the
workqueue needs to stay allocated.

The abridged kernel panic that occurs without this patch is as follows:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 687 at kernel/irq/msi.c:292 msi_device_data_release+0x6c/0x9c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
