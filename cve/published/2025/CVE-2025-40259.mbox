Subject: CVE-2025-40259: scsi: sg: Do not sleep in atomic context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sg: Do not sleep in atomic context

sg_finish_rem_req() calls blk_rq_unmap_user(). The latter function may
sleep. Hence, call sg_finish_rem_req() with interrupts enabled instead
of disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40259 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
