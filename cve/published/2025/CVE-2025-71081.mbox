Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe

The reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing the
platform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback
fails during DAI probe.

Make sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe
deferral) and on driver unbind.

This also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever
reprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
