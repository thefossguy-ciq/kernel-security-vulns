Subject: CVE-2025-22046: uprobes/x86: Harden uretprobe syscall trampoline check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uprobes/x86: Harden uretprobe syscall trampoline check

Jann reported a possible issue when trampoline_check_ip returns
address near the bottom of the address space that is allowed to
call into the syscall if uretprobes are not set up:

Though the mmap minimum address restrictions will typically prevent
creating mappings there, let's make sure uretprobe syscall checks
for that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22046 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
