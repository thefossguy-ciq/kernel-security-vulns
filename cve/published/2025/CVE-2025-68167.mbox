Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: fix invalid pointer access in debugfs

If the memory allocation in gpiolib_seq_start() fails, the s->private
field remains uninitialized and is later dereferenced without checking
in gpiolib_seq_stop(). Initialize s->private to NULL before calling
kzalloc() and check it before dereferencing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68167 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
