Subject: CVE-2025-38112: net: Fix TOCTOU issue in sk_is_readable()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix TOCTOU issue in sk_is_readable()

sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable is a valid function pointer when sk resides
in a sockmap. After the last sk_psock_put() (which usually happens when
socket is removed from sockmap), sk->sk_prot gets restored and
sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable becomes NULL.

This makes sk_is_readable() racy, if the value of sk->sk_prot is reloaded
after the initial check. Which in turn may lead to a null pointer
dereference.

Ensure the function pointer does not turn NULL after the check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
