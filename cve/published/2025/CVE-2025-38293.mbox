Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix node corruption in ar->arvifs list

In current WLAN recovery code flow, ath11k_core_halt() only
reinitializes the "arvifs" list head. This will cause the
list node immediately following the list head to become an
invalid list node. Because the prev of that node still points
to the list head "arvifs", but the next of the list head "arvifs"
no longer points to that list node.

When a WLAN recovery occurs during the execution of a vif
removal, and it happens before the spin_lock_bh(&ar->data_lock)
in ath11k_mac_op_remove_interface(), list_del() will detect the
previously mentioned situation, thereby triggering a kernel panic.

The fix is to remove and reinitialize all vif list nodes from the
list head "arvifs" during WLAN halt. The reinitialization is to make
the list nodes valid, ensuring that the list_del() in
ath11k_mac_op_remove_interface() can execute normally.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
