Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipmr: do not call mr_mfc_uses_dev() for unres entries

syzbot found that calling mr_mfc_uses_dev() for unres entries
would crash [1], because c->mfc_un.res.minvif / c->mfc_un.res.maxvif
alias to "struct sk_buff_head unresolved", which contain two pointers.

This code never worked, lets remove it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
