Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-mem: Add fix to avoid divide error

For some SPI flash memory operations, dummy bytes are not mandatory. For
example, in Winbond SPINAND flash memory devices, the `write_cache` and
`update_cache` operation variants have zero dummy bytes. Calculating the
duration for SPI memory operations with zero dummy bytes causes
a divide error when `ncycles` is calculated in the
spi_mem_calc_op_duration().

Add changes to skip the 'ncylcles' calculation for zero dummy bytes.

Following divide error is fixed by this change:

 Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1915dbd67dadc0bb35670c8e28229baa29368d17
