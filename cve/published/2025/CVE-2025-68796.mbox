Subject: CVE-2025-68796: f2fs: fix to avoid updating zero-sized extent in extent cache

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid updating zero-sized extent in extent cache

As syzbot reported:

F2FS-fs (loop0): __update_extent_tree_range: extent len is zero, type: 0, extent [0, 0, 0], age [0, 0]
------------[ cut here ]------------

In error path of f2fs_zero_range(), it may add a zero-sized extent
into extent cache, it should be avoided.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68796 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
