Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: pru: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in pru_rproc_set_ctable()

pru_rproc_set_ctable() accessed rproc->priv before the IS_ERR_OR_NULL
check, which could lead to a null pointer dereference. Move the pru
assignment, ensuring we never dereference a NULL rproc pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40033 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
