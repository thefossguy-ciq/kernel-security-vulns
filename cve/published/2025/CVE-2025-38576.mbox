Subject: CVE-2025-38576: powerpc/eeh: Make EEH driver device hotplug safe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/eeh: Make EEH driver device hotplug safe

Multiple race conditions existed between the PCIe hotplug driver and the
EEH driver, leading to a variety of kernel oopses of the same general
nature:

<pcie device unplug>
<eeh driver trigger>
<hotplug removal trigger>
<pcie tree reconfiguration>
<eeh recovery next step>
<oops in EEH driver bus iteration loop>

A second class of oops is also seen when the underlying bus disappears
during device recovery.

Refactor the EEH module to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also clean
up a few minor formatting / readability issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38576 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
