Subject: CVE-2025-38570: eth: fbnic: unlink NAPIs from queues on error to open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: fbnic: unlink NAPIs from queues on error to open

CI hit a UaF in fbnic in the AF_XDP portion of the queues.py test.
The UaF is in the __sk_mark_napi_id_once() call in xsk_bind(),
NAPI has been freed. Looks like the device failed to open earlier,
and we lack clearing the NAPI pointer from the queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38570 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
