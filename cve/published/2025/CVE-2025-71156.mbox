Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: defer interrupt enabling until NAPI registration

Currently, interrupts are automatically enabled immediately upon
request. This allows interrupt to fire before the associated NAPI
context is fully initialized and cause failures like below:

[    0.946369] Call Trace:
[    0.946369]  <IRQ>
[    0.946369]  __napi_poll+0x2a/0x1e0

[    0.946369] RIP: 0010:pv_native_safe_halt+0xb/0x10

Use the `IRQF_NO_AUTOEN` flag when requesting interrupts to prevent auto
enablement and explicitly enable the interrupt in NAPI initialization
path (and disable it during NAPI teardown).

This ensures that interrupt lifecycle is strictly coupled with
readiness of NAPI context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71156 to this issue.

will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/google/gve/gve_main.c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f5b7f49bd2377916ad57cbd1210c61196daff013
