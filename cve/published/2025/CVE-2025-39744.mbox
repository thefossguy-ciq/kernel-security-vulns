Subject: CVE-2025-39744: rcu: Fix rcu_read_unlock() deadloop due to IRQ work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Fix rcu_read_unlock() deadloop due to IRQ work

During rcu_read_unlock_special(), if this happens during irq_exit(), we
can lockup if an IPI is issued. This is because the IPI itself triggers
the irq_exit() path causing a recursive lock up.

This is precisely what Xiongfeng found when invoking a BPF program on
the trace_tick_stop() tracepoint As shown in the trace below. Fix by
managing the irq_work state correctly.

irq_exit()
  __irq_exit_rcu()
    /* in_hardirq() returns false after this */
    preempt_count_sub(HARDIRQ_OFFSET)
    tick_irq_exit()
      tick_nohz_irq_exit()
	    tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick()
	      trace_tick_stop()  /* a bpf prog is hooked on this trace point */
		   __bpf_trace_tick_stop()
		      bpf_trace_run2()
			    rcu_read_unlock_special()
                              /* will send a IPI to itself */
			      irq_work_queue_on(&rdp->defer_qs_iw, rdp->cpu);

A simple reproducer can also be obtained by doing the following in
tick_irq_exit(). It will hang on boot without the patch:

  static inline void tick_irq_exit(void)
  {
 +	rcu_read_lock();
 +	WRITE_ONCE(current->rcu_read_unlock_special.b.need_qs, true);
 +	rcu_read_unlock();
 +

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39744 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
