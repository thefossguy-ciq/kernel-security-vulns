Subject: CVE-2025-38665: can: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_mode

Andrei Lalaev reported a NULL pointer deref when a CAN device is
restarted from Bus Off and the driver does not implement the struct
can_priv::do_set_mode callback.

There are 2 code path that call struct can_priv::do_set_mode:
- directly by a manual restart from the user space, via
  can_changelink()
- delayed automatic restart after bus off (deactivated by default)

To prevent the NULL pointer deference, refuse a manual restart or
configure the automatic restart delay in can_changelink() and report
the error via extack to user space.

As an additional safety measure let can_restart() return an error if
can_priv::do_set_mode is not set instead of dereferencing it
unchecked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38665 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
