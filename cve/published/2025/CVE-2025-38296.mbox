Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: platform_profile: Avoid initializing on non-ACPI platforms

The platform profile driver is loaded even on platforms that do not have
ACPI enabled. The initialization of the sysfs entries was recently moved
from platform_profile_register() to the module init call, and those
entries need acpi_kobj to be initialized which is not the case when ACPI
is disabled.

This results in the following warning:

 WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/group.c:131 internal_create_group+0xa22/0xdd8
 Modules linked in:

Fix this by checking if ACPI is enabled before trying to create sysfs
entries.

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/acpi/platform_profile.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ccc3d68b92be89c30ba42ac62d2a141bd0c2b457
