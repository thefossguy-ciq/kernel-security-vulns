Subject: CVE-2025-39732: wifi: ath11k: fix sleeping-in-atomic in ath11k_mac_op_set_bitrate_mask()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix sleeping-in-atomic in ath11k_mac_op_set_bitrate_mask()

ath11k_mac_disable_peer_fixed_rate() is passed as the iterator to
ieee80211_iterate_stations_atomic(). Note in this case the iterator is
required to be atomic, however ath11k_mac_disable_peer_fixed_rate() does
not follow it as it might sleep. Consequently below warning is seen:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at wmi.c:304
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 dump_stack_lvl
 __might_resched.cold
 ath11k_wmi_cmd_send
 ath11k_wmi_set_peer_param
 ath11k_mac_disable_peer_fixed_rate
 ieee80211_iterate_stations_atomic
 ath11k_mac_op_set_bitrate_mask.cold

Change to ieee80211_iterate_stations_mtx() to fix this issue.

Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.30

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39732 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
