Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: cadence: Fix out-of-bounds array access in cdns_mrvl_xspi_setup_clock()

If requested_clk > 128, cdns_mrvl_xspi_setup_clock() iterates over the
entire cdns_mrvl_xspi_clk_div_list array without breaking out early,
causing 'i' to go beyond the array bounds.

Fix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry, clamping
the clock to the minimum 6.25 MHz.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: cdns_mrvl_xspi_setup_clock: unexpected end of section .text.cdns_mrvl_xspi_setup_clock

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22067 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
