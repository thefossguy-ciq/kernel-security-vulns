Subject: CVE-2025-40295: fscrypt: fix left shift underflow when inode->i_blkbits > PAGE_SHIFT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscrypt: fix left shift underflow when inode->i_blkbits > PAGE_SHIFT

When simulating an nvme device on qemu with both logical_block_size and
physical_block_size set to 8 KiB, an error trace appears during
partition table reading at boot time. The issue is caused by
inode->i_blkbits being larger than PAGE_SHIFT, which leads to a left
shift of -1 and triggering a UBSAN warning.

This situation can happen for block devices because when
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is enabled, the maximum logical_block_size
is 64 KiB. set_init_blocksize() then sets the block device
inode->i_blkbits to 13, which is within this limit.

File I/O does not trigger this problem because for filesystems that do
not support the FS_LBS feature, sb_set_blocksize() prevents
sb->s_blocksize_bits from being larger than PAGE_SHIFT. During inode
allocation, alloc_inode()->inode_init_always() assigns inode->i_blkbits
from sb->s_blocksize_bits. Currently, only xfs_fs_type has the FS_LBS
flag, and since xfs I/O paths do not reach submit_bh_wbc(), it does not
hit the left-shift underflow issue.

[EB: use folio_pos() and consolidate the two shifts by i_blkbits]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
