Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipmi:msghandler: Fix potential memory corruption in ipmi_create_user()

The "intf" list iterator is an invalid pointer if the correct
"intf->intf_num" is not found.  Calling atomic_dec(&intf->nr_users) on
and invalid pointer will lead to memory corruption.

We don't really need to call atomic_dec() if we haven't called
atomic_add_return() so update the if (intf->in_shutdown) path as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38456 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
