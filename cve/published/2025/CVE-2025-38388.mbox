Subject: CVE-2025-38388: firmware: arm_ffa: Replace mutex with rwlock to avoid sleep in atomic context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_ffa: Replace mutex with rwlock to avoid sleep in atomic context

The current use of a mutex to protect the notifier hashtable accesses
can lead to issues in the atomic context. It results in the below
kernel warnings:

  |  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:258
  |  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 9, name: kworker/0:0
  |  preempt_count: 1, expected: 0

To address this, replace the mutex with an rwlock to protect the notifier
hashtable accesses. This ensures that read-side locking does not sleep and
multiple readers can acquire the lock concurrently, avoiding unnecessary
contention and potential deadlocks. Writer access remains exclusive,
preserving correctness.

This change resolves warnings from lockdep about potential sleep in
atomic context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38388 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31405510a48dcf054abfa5b7b8d70ce1b27d1f13
