Subject: CVE-2025-37749: net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data on ppp_sync_txmung

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data on ppp_sync_txmung

Ensure we have enough data in linear buffer from skb before accessing
initial bytes. This prevents potential out-of-bounds accesses
when processing short packets.

When ppp_sync_txmung receives an incoming package with an empty
payload:
(remote) gefâž¤  p *(struct pppoe_hdr *) (skb->head + skb->network_header)
$18 = {
	type = 0x1,
	ver = 0x1,
	code = 0x0,
	sid = 0x2,
        length = 0x0,
	tag = 0xffff8880371cdb96
}

from the skb struct (trimmed)
      tail = 0x16,
      end = 0x140,
      head = 0xffff88803346f400 "4",
      data = 0xffff88803346f416 ":\377",
      truesize = 0x380,
      len = 0x0,
      data_len = 0x0,
      mac_len = 0xe,
      hdr_len = 0x0,

it is not safe to access data[2].

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
