Subject: CVE-2025-37791: ethtool: cmis_cdb: use correct rpl size in ethtool_cmis_module_poll()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: cmis_cdb: use correct rpl size in ethtool_cmis_module_poll()

rpl is passed as a pointer to ethtool_cmis_module_poll(), so the correct
size of rpl is sizeof(*rpl) which should be just 1 byte.  Using the
pointer size instead can cause stack corruption:

Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in: ethtool_cmis_wait_for_cond+0xf4/0x100

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
