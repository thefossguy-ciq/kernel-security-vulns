Subject: CVE-2025-39873: can: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: xilinx_can: xcan_write_frame(): fix use-after-free of transmitted SKB

can_put_echo_skb() takes ownership of the SKB and it may be freed
during or after the call.

However, xilinx_can xcan_write_frame() keeps using SKB after the call.

Fix that by only calling can_put_echo_skb() after the code is done
touching the SKB.

The tx_lock is held for the entire xcan_write_frame() execution and
also on the can_get_echo_skb() side so the order of operations does not
matter.

An earlier fix commit 3d3c817c3a40 ("can: xilinx_can: Fix usage of skb
memory") did not move the can_put_echo_skb() call far enough.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
