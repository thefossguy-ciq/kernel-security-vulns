Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fc: use lock accessing port_state and rport state

nvme_fc_unregister_remote removes the remote port on a lport object at
any point in time when there is no active association. This races with
with the reconnect logic, because nvme_fc_create_association is not
taking a lock to check the port_state and atomically increase the
active count on the rport.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40342 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
