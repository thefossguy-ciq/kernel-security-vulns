Subject: CVE-2025-22120: ext4: goto right label 'out_mmap_sem' in ext4_setattr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: goto right label 'out_mmap_sem' in ext4_setattr()

Otherwise, if ext4_inode_attach_jinode() fails, a hung task will
happen because filemap_invalidate_unlock() isn't called to unlock
mapping->invalidate_lock. Like this:

EXT4-fs error (device sda) in ext4_setattr:5557: Out of memory
INFO: task fsstress:374 blocked for more than 122 seconds.
      Not tainted 6.14.0-rc1-next-20250206-xfstests-dirty #726
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/32d872e3905746ff1048078256cb00f946b97d8a
