Subject: CVE-2025-38172: erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
      erofs_read_superblock
        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                           // return -ENOTBLK
      deactivate_locked_super
        free(sbi)
    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38172 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
