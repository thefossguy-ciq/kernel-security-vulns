Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in __smb2_lease_break_noti()

Move tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is
referenced when ksmbd server thread terminates, It will not be freed,
but conn->tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed
asynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti
calls ksmbd_conn_write, which can cause use-after-free
when conn->ksmbd_transport is already freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37777 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.14.4 with commit e59796fc80603bcd8569d4d2e10b213c1918edb4
	Fixed in 6.15-rc3 with commit 21a4e47578d44c6b37c4fc4aba8ed7cc8dbb13de

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-37777
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/smb/server/connection.c
	fs/smb/server/transport_tcp.c
	fs/smb/server/transport_tcp.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e59796fc80603bcd8569d4d2e10b213c1918edb4
