Subject: CVE-2025-39871: dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free

The call to idxd_free() introduces a duplicate put_device() leading to a
reference count underflow:
refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 15 PID: 4428 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbe/0x110
...
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
  idxd_remove+0xe4/0x120 [idxd]

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e

The idxd_unregister_devices() which is invoked at the very beginning of
idxd_remove(), already takes care of the necessary put_device() through the
following call path:
idxd_unregister_devices() -> device_unregister() -> put_device()

In addition, when CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE is enabled, put_device() may
trigger asynchronous cleanup via schedule_delayed_work(). If idxd_free() is
called immediately after, it can result in a use-after-free.

Remove the improper idxd_free() to avoid both the refcount underflow and
potential memory corruption during module unload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
