Subject: CVE-2025-38580: ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()

In ext4_io_end_defer_completion(), check if io_end->list_vec is empty to
avoid adding an io_end that requires no conversion to the
i_rsv_conversion_list, which in turn prevents starting an unnecessary
worker. An ext4_emergency_state() check is also added to avoid attempting
to abort the journal in an emergency state.

Additionally, ext4_put_io_end_defer() is refactored to call
ext4_io_end_defer_completion() directly instead of being open-coded.
This also prevents starting an unnecessary worker when EXT4_IO_END_FAILED
is set but data_err=abort is not enabled.

This ensures that the check in ext4_put_io_end_defer() is consistent with
the check in ext4_end_bio(). Otherwise, we might add an io_end to the
i_rsv_conversion_list and then call ext4_finish_bio(), after which the
inode could be freed before ext4_end_io_rsv_work() is called, triggering
a use-after-free issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38580 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
