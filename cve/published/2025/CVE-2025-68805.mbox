Subject: CVE-2025-68805: fuse: fix io-uring list corruption for terminated non-committed requests

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: fix io-uring list corruption for terminated non-committed requests

When a request is terminated before it has been committed, the request
is not removed from the queue's list. This leaves a dangling list entry
that leads to list corruption and use-after-free issues.

Remove the request from the queue's list for terminated non-committed
requests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68805 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
