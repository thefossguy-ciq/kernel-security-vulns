Subject: CVE-2025-38660: [ceph] parse_longname(): strrchr() expects NUL-terminated string

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

[ceph] parse_longname(): strrchr() expects NUL-terminated string

... and parse_longname() is not guaranteed that.  That's the reason
why it uses kmemdup_nul() to build the argument for kstrtou64();
the problem is, kstrtou64() is not the only thing that need it.

Just get a NUL-terminated copy of the entire thing and be done
with that...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38660 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
