Subject: CVE-2025-39890: wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_service_ready_ext_event

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_service_ready_ext_event

Currently, in ath12k_service_ready_ext_event(), svc_rdy_ext.mac_phy_caps
is not freed in the failure case, causing a memory leak. The following
trace is observed in kmemleak:

unreferenced object 0xffff8b3eb5789c00 (size 1024):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
