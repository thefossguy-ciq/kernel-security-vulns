Subject: CVE-2025-71143: clk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: samsung: exynos-clkout: Assign .num before accessing .hws

Commit f316cdff8d67 ("clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with
__counted_by") annotated the hws member of 'struct clk_hw_onecell_data'
with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer (UBSAN_BOUNDS)
about the number of elements in .hws[], so that it can warn when .hws[]
is accessed out of bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by
member must be initialized with the number of elements before the first
array access happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access
prior to the initialization because the number of elements is zero. This
occurs in exynos_clkout_probe() due to .num being assigned after .hws[]
has been accessed:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos-clkout.c:178:18
  index 0 is out of range for type 'clk_hw *[*]'

Move the .num initialization to before the first access of .hws[],
clearing up the warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71143 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
