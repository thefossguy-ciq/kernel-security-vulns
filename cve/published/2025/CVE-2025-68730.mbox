Subject: CVE-2025-68730: accel/ivpu: Fix page fault in ivpu_bo_unbind_all_bos_from_context()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix page fault in ivpu_bo_unbind_all_bos_from_context()

Don't add BO to the vdev->bo_list in ivpu_gem_create_object().
When failure happens inside drm_gem_shmem_create(), the BO is not
fully created and ivpu_gem_bo_free() callback will not be called
causing a deleted BO to be left on the list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68730 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
