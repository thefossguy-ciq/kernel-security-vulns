Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arch_topology: Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()

Fix incorrect use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()
which causes the code to proceed with NULL clock pointers. The current
logic uses !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) which evaluates to true for both
valid pointers and NULL, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference
in clk_get_rate().

Per include/linux/err.h documentation, PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(ptr) returns:
"The error code within @ptr if it is an error pointer; 0 otherwise."

This means PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() returns 0 for both valid pointers AND NULL
pointers. Therefore !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) evaluates to true (proceed)
when cpu_clk is either valid or NULL, causing clk_get_rate(NULL) to be
called when of_clk_get() returns NULL.

Replace with !IS_ERR_OR_NULL(cpu_clk) which only proceeds for valid
pointers, preventing potential NULL pointer dereference in clk_get_rate().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40346 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
