Subject: CVE-2025-40098: ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Fix NULL pointer dereference in cs35l41_get_acpi_mute_state()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Fix NULL pointer dereference in cs35l41_get_acpi_mute_state()

Return value of a function acpi_evaluate_dsm() is dereferenced  without
checking for NULL, but it is usually checked for this function.

acpi_evaluate_dsm() may return NULL, when acpi_evaluate_object() returns
acpi_status other than ACPI_SUCCESS, so add a check to prevent the crach.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40098 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
