Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mctp i3c: handle NULL header address

daddr can be NULL if there is no neighbour table entry present,
in that case the tx packet should be dropped.

saddr will usually be set by MCTP core, but check for NULL in case a
packet is transmitted by a different protocol.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21903 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8be54c35aee29d96d1350b1b6f153be4da37c07
