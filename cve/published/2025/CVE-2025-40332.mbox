Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix mmap write lock not release

If mmap write lock is taken while draining retry fault, mmap write lock
is not released because svm_range_restore_pages calls mmap_read_unlock
then returns. This causes deadlock and system hangs later because mmap
read or write lock cannot be taken.

Downgrade mmap write lock to read lock if draining retry fault fix this
bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40332 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
