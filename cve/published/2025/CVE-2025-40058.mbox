Subject: CVE-2025-40058: iommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Disallow dirty tracking if incoherent page walk

Dirty page tracking relies on the IOMMU atomically updating the dirty bit
in the paging-structure entry. For this operation to succeed, the paging-
structure memory must be coherent between the IOMMU and the CPU. In
another word, if the iommu page walk is incoherent, dirty page tracking
doesn't work.

The Intel VT-d specification, Section 3.10 "Snoop Behavior" states:

"Remapping hardware encountering the need to atomically update A/EA/D bits
 in a paging-structure entry that is not snooped will result in a non-
 recoverable fault."

To prevent an IOMMU from being incorrectly configured for dirty page
tracking when it is operating in an incoherent mode, mark SSADS as
supported only when both ecap_slads and ecap_smpwc are supported.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
