Subject: CVE-2025-37981: scsi: smartpqi: Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump

The smartpqi driver checks the reset_devices variable to determine
whether special adjustments need to be made for kdump. This has the
effect that after a regular kexec reboot, some driver parameters such as
max_transfer_size are much lower than usual. More importantly, kexec
reboot tests have revealed memory corruption caused by the driver log
being written to system memory after a kexec.

Fix this by testing is_kdump_kernel() rather than reset_devices where
appropriate.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37981 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
