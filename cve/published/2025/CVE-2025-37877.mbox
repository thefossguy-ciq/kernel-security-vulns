Subject: CVE-2025-37877: iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly
the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
we clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37877 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
