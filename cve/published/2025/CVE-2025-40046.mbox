Subject: CVE-2025-40046: io_uring/zcrx: fix overshooting recv limit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/zcrx: fix overshooting recv limit

It's reported that sometimes a zcrx request can receive more than was
requested. It's caused by io_zcrx_recv_skb() adjusting desc->count for
all received buffers including frag lists, but then doing recursive
calls to process frag list skbs, which leads to desc->count double
accounting and underflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40046 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8bcc9eaf1b19f1a7029cba19f6bd4122b40f6c4f
