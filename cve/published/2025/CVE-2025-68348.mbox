Subject: CVE-2025-68348: block: fix memory leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix memory leak in __blkdev_issue_zero_pages

Move the fatal signal check before bio_alloc() to prevent a memory
leak when BLKDEV_ZERO_KILLABLE is set and a fatal signal is pending.

Previously, the bio was allocated before checking for a fatal signal.
If a signal was pending, the code would break out of the loop without
freeing or chaining the just-allocated bio, causing a memory leak.

This matches the pattern already used in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes()
where the signal check precedes the allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68348 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
