Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work

The dev3_register_work delayed work item is initialized within
alps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare
PS/2 packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS
touchpad. During device detachment, the original implementation
calls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure
completion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()
in psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that
were already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any
work items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not
included in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.
This means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,
the dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the
psmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),
the scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.

The race condition can occur as follows:

CPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)
psmouse_disconnect()     |
  psmouse_set_state()    |
  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()
  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()
    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()
                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE
                         |   priv->dev3 // USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure
that dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from
executing after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.

This bug is identified by static analysis.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed8c61b89be0c45f029228b2913d5cf7b5cda1a7
