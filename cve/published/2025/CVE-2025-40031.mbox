Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: fix register_shm_helper()

In register_shm_helper(), fix incorrect error handling for a call to
iov_iter_extract_pages(). A case is missing for when
iov_iter_extract_pages() only got some pages and return a number larger
than 0, but not the requested amount.

This fixes a possible NULL pointer dereference following a bad input from
ioctl(TEE_IOC_SHM_REGISTER) where parts of the buffer isn't mapped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40031 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
