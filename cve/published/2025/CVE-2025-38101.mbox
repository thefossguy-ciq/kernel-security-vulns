Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ring-buffer: Fix buffer locking in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set()

Enlarge the critical section in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set() to
ensure that error handling takes place with per-buffer mutex held,
thus preventing list corruption and other concurrency-related issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
