Subject: CVE-2025-39786: iio: adc: ad7173: fix channels index for syscalib_mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7173: fix channels index for syscalib_mode

Fix the index used to look up the channel when accessing the
syscalib_mode attribute. The address field is a 0-based index (same
as scan_index) that it used to access the channel in the
ad7173_channels array throughout the driver. The channels field, on
the other hand, may not match the address field depending on the
channel configuration specified in the device tree and could result
in an out-of-bounds access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39786 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2def1a8691eb43654da0ae0d2fdb3722e20262a5
