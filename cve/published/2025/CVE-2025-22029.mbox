Subject: CVE-2025-22029: exec: fix the racy usage of fs_struct->in_exec

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exec: fix the racy usage of fs_struct->in_exec

check_unsafe_exec() sets fs->in_exec under cred_guard_mutex, then execve()
paths clear fs->in_exec lockless. This is fine if exec succeeds, but if it
fails we have the following race:

	T1 sets fs->in_exec = 1, fails, drops cred_guard_mutex

	T2 sets fs->in_exec = 1

	T1 clears fs->in_exec

	T2 continues with fs->in_exec == 0

Change fs/exec.c to clear fs->in_exec with cred_guard_mutex held.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22029 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
