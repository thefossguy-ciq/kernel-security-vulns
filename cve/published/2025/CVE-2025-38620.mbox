Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

zloop: fix KASAN use-after-free of tag set

When a zoned loop device, or zloop device, is removed, KASAN enabled
kernel reports "BUG KASAN use-after-free" in blk_mq_free_tag_set(). The
BUG happens because zloop_ctl_remove() calls put_disk(), which invokes
zloop_free_disk(). The zloop_free_disk() frees the memory allocated for
the zlo pointer. However, after the memory is freed, zloop_ctl_remove()
calls blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set), which accesses the freed zlo.
Hence the KASAN use-after-free.

 zloop_ctl_remove()
  put_disk(zlo->disk)
   put_device()
    kobject_put()
     ...
      zloop_free_disk()
        kvfree(zlo)
  blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)

To avoid the BUG, move the call to blk_mq_free_tag_set(&zlo->tag_set)
from zloop_ctl_remove() into zloop_free_disk(). This ensures that
the tag_set is freed before the call to kvfree(zlo).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38620 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7c87046b41a9ef28ee7ac476c369da5b5228bc5
