Subject: CVE-2025-37947: ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos

ksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset
(*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).
If *pos was greater than or equal to v_len, this could lead to an
out-of-bounds memory write.

This patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len before
proceeding. If the condition fails, -EINVAL is returned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
