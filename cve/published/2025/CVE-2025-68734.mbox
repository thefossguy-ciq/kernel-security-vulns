Subject: CVE-2025-68734: isdn: mISDN: hfcsusb: fix memory leak in hfcsusb_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

isdn: mISDN: hfcsusb: fix memory leak in hfcsusb_probe()

In hfcsusb_probe(), the memory allocated for ctrl_urb gets leaked when
setup_instance() fails with an error code. Fix that by freeing the urb
before freeing the hw structure. Also change the error paths to use the
goto ladder style.

Compile tested only. Issue found using a prototype static analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68734 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
