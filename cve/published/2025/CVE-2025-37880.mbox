Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode

sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in
time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with
time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a
sched_yield syscall.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37880 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/um/include/linux/time-internal.h
	arch/um/kernel/skas/syscall.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da780c4a075ba2deb05ae29f0af4a990578c7901
