Subject: CVE-2025-38021: drm/amd/display: Fix null check of pipe_ctx->plane_state for update_dchubp_dpp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix null check of pipe_ctx->plane_state for update_dchubp_dpp

Similar to commit 6a057072ddd1 ("drm/amd/display: Fix null check for
pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe") that addresses a null
pointer dereference on dcn20_update_dchubp_dpp. This is the same
function hooked for update_dchubp_dpp in dcn401, with the same issue.
Fix possible null pointer deference on dcn401_program_pipe too.

(cherry picked from commit d8d47f739752227957d8efc0cb894761bfe1d879)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4679061fb25344d6010ce7b9bebac21c91a0b75a
