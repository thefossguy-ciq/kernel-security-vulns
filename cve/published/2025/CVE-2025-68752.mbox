Subject: CVE-2025-68752: iavf: Implement settime64 with -EOPNOTSUPP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: Implement settime64 with -EOPNOTSUPP

ptp_clock_settime() assumes every ptp_clock has implemented settime64().
Stub it with -EOPNOTSUPP to prevent a NULL dereference.

The fix is similar to commit 329d050bbe63 ("gve: Implement settime64
with -EOPNOTSUPP").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68752 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
