Subject: CVE-2025-37966: riscv: Fix kernel crash due to PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Fix kernel crash due to PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL

When userspace does PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL, but Supm extension is not
available, the kernel crashes:

Oops - illegal instruction [#1]
    [snip]
epc : set_tagged_addr_ctrl+0x112/0x15a
 ra : set_tagged_addr_ctrl+0x74/0x15a
epc : ffffffff80011ace ra : ffffffff80011a30 sp : ffffffc60039be10
    [snip]
status: 0000000200000120 badaddr: 0000000010a79073 cause: 0000000000000002

    do_trap_ecall_u+0x17c/0x20c

Fix it by checking if Supm is available.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b595a2f5656cd45d534ed2160c94f7662adefe5
