Subject: CVE-2025-68314: drm/msm: make sure last_fence is always updated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: make sure last_fence is always updated

Update last_fence in the vm-bind path instead of kernel managed path.

last_fence is used to wait for work to finish in vm_bind contexts but not
used for kernel managed contexts.

This fixes a bug where last_fence is not waited on context close leading
to faults as resources are freed while in use.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
