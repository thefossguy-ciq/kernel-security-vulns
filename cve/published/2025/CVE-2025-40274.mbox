Subject: CVE-2025-40274: KVM: guest_memfd: Remove bindings on memslot deletion when gmem is dying

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: guest_memfd: Remove bindings on memslot deletion when gmem is dying

When unbinding a memslot from a guest_memfd instance, remove the bindings
even if the guest_memfd file is dying, i.e. even if its file refcount has
gone to zero.  If the memslot is freed before the file is fully released,
nullifying the memslot side of the binding in kvm_gmem_release() will
write to freed memory, as detected by syzbot+KASAN:

Deliberately don't acquire filemap invalid lock when the file is dying as
the lifecycle of f_mapping is outside the purview of KVM.  Dereferencing
the mapping is *probably* fine, but there's no need to invalidate anything
as memslot deletion is responsible for zapping SPTEs, and the only code
that can access the dying file is kvm_gmem_release(), whose core code is
mutually exclusive with unbinding.

Note, the mutual exclusivity is also what makes it safe to access the
bindings on a dying gmem instance.  Unbinding either runs with slots_lock
held, or after the last reference to the owning "struct kvm" is put, and
kvm_gmem_release() nullifies the slot pointer under slots_lock, and puts
its reference to the VM after that is done.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40274 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
