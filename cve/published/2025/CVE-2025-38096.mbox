Subject: CVE-2025-38096: wifi: iwlwifi: don't warn when if there is a FW error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: don't warn when if there is a FW error

iwl_trans_reclaim is warning if it is called when the FW is not alive.
But if it is called when there is a pending restart, i.e. after a FW
error, there is no need to warn, instead - return silently.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38096 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
