Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM

Per family bind/unbind callbacks were introduced to allow families
to track multicast group consumer presence, e.g. to start or stop
producing events depending on listeners.

However, in genl_bind() the bind() callback was invoked even if
capability checks failed and ret was set to -EPERM. This means that
callbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the
syscall still returned failure to user space.

Fix this by only invoking bind() after "if (ret) break;" check
i.e. after permission checks have succeeded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39926 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
