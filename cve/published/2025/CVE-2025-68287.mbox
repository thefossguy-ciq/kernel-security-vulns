Subject: CVE-2025-68287: usb: dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths

This patch addresses a race condition caused by unsynchronized
execution of multiple call paths invoking `dwc3_remove_requests()`,
leading to premature freeing of USB requests and subsequent crashes.

Three distinct execution paths interact with `dwc3_remove_requests()`:
Path 1:
Triggered via `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()` during USB reset
handling. The call stack includes:
- `dwc3_ep0_reset_state()`
- `dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart()`
- `dwc3_ep0_out_start()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()`
- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`

Path 2:
Also initiated from `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()`, but through
`dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`. The call stack includes:
- `dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()`
- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`

Path 3:
Occurs independently during `adb root` execution, which triggers
USB function unbind and bind operations. The sequence includes:
- `gserial_disconnect()`
- `usb_ep_disable()`
- `dwc3_gadget_ep_disable()`
- `dwc3_remove_requests()` with `-ESHUTDOWN` status

Path 3 operates asynchronously and lacks synchronization with Paths
1 and 2. When Path 3 completes, it disables endpoints and frees 'out'
requests. If Paths 1 or 2 are still processing these requests,
accessing freed memory leads to a crash due to use-after-free conditions.

To fix this added check for request completion and skip processing
if already completed and added the request status for ep0 while queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68287 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
