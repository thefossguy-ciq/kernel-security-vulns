Subject: CVE-2025-68355: bpf: Fix exclusive map memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix exclusive map memory leak

When excl_prog_hash is 0 and excl_prog_hash_size is non-zero, the map also
needs to be freed. Otherwise, the map memory will not be reclaimed, just
like the memory leak problem reported by syzbot [1].

syzbot reported:
BUG: memory leak
  backtrace (crc 7b9fb9b4):
    map_create+0x322/0x11e0 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:1512
    __sys_bpf+0x3556/0x3610 kernel/bpf/syscall.c:6131

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68355 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
