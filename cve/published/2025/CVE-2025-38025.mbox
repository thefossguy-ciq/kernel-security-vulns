Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7606: check for NULL before calling sw_mode_config()

Check that the sw_mode_config function pointer is not NULL before
calling it. Not all buses define this callback, which resulted in a NULL
pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c28ad63aa55eaadad2b1793b90bfbe7296cc03ba
