Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: fs, fix UAF in flow counter release

Fix a kernel trace [1] caused by releasing an HWS action of a local flow
counter in mlx5_cmd_hws_delete_fte(), where the HWS action refcount and
mutex were not initialized and the counter struct could already be freed
when deleting the rule.

Fix it by adding the missing initializations and adding refcount for the
local flow counter struct.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
