Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7996: add missing check for rx wcid entries

Non-station wcid entries must not be passed to the rx functions.
In case of the global wcid entry, it could even lead to corruption in the wcid
array due to pointer being casted to struct mt7996_sta_link using container_of.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39919 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69dcc19048fcdc3fb166fd25b805470ee8fc0eb1
