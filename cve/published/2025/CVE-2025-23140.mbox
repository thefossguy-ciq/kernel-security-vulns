Subject: CVE-2025-23140: misc: pci_endpoint_test: Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: pci_endpoint_test: Avoid issue of interrupts remaining after request_irq error

After devm_request_irq() fails with error in pci_endpoint_test_request_irq(),
the pci_endpoint_test_free_irq_vectors() is called assuming that all IRQs
have been released.

However, some requested IRQs remain unreleased, so there are still
/proc/irq/* entries remaining, and this results in WARN() with the
following message:

  remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/30', leaking at least 'pci-endpoint-test.0'
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 202 at fs/proc/generic.c:719 remove_proc_entry +0x190/0x19c

To solve this issue, set the number of remaining IRQs to test->num_irqs,
and release IRQs in advance by calling pci_endpoint_test_release_irq().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
