Subject: CVE-2025-38038: cpufreq: amd-pstate: Remove unnecessary driver_lock in set_boost

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: amd-pstate: Remove unnecessary driver_lock in set_boost

set_boost is a per-policy function call, hence a driver wide lock is
unnecessary. Also this mutex_acquire can collide with the mutex_acquire
from the mode-switch path in status_store(), which can lead to a
deadlock. So, remove it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38038 to this issue.

===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.31 with commit 61e931ee145eeab8196e585ff4334870b130b744

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
