Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix untrusted unsigned subtract

Fix the following Smatch static checker warning:

   net/rxrpc/rxgk_app.c:65 rxgk_yfs_decode_ticket()
   warn: untrusted unsigned subtract. 'ticket_len - 10 * 4'

by prechecking the length of what we're trying to extract in two places in
the token and decoding for a response packet.

Also use sizeof() on the struct we're extracting rather specifying the size
numerically to be consistent with the other related statements.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39962 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71571e187106631a8127f2dde780f35caa358d33
