Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser

The Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length
byte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after
the 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed
frame can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing
the parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results
in out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.

Fix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit
before accepting the IE or advancing to the next element.

This prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates safely on
malformed frames.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68256 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
