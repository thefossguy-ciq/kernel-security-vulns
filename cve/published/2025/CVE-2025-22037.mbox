Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix null pointer dereference in alloc_preauth_hash()

The Client send malformed smb2 negotiate request. ksmbd return error
response. Subsequently, the client can send smb2 session setup even
thought conn->preauth_info is not allocated.
This patch add KSMBD_SESS_NEED_SETUP status of connection to ignore
session setup request if smb2 negotiate phase is not complete.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22037 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
