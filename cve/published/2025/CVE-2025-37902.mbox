Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: fix copying after src array boundaries

The blammed commit copied to argv the size of the reallocated argv,
instead of the size of the old_argv, thus reading and copying from
past the old_argv allocated memory.

Following BUG_ON was hit:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
