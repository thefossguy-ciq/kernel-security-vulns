Subject: CVE-2025-39842: ocfs2: prevent release journal inode after journal shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: prevent release journal inode after journal shutdown

Before calling ocfs2_delete_osb(), ocfs2_journal_shutdown() has already
been executed in ocfs2_dismount_volume(), so osb->journal must be NULL. 
Therefore, the following calltrace will inevitably fail when it reaches
jbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode().

ocfs2_dismount_volume()->
  ocfs2_delete_osb()->
    ocfs2_free_slot_info()->
      __ocfs2_free_slot_info()->
        evict()->
          ocfs2_evict_inode()->
            ocfs2_clear_inode()->
	      jbd2_journal_release_jbd_inode(osb->journal->j_journal,

Adding osb->journal checks will prevent null-ptr-deref during the above
execution path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
