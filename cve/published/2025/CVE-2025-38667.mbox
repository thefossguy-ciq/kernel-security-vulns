Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: fix potential out-of-bound write

The buffer is set to 20 characters. If a caller write more characters,
count is truncated to the max available space in "simple_write_to_buffer".
To protect from OoB access, check that the input size fit into buffer and
add a zero terminator after copy to the end of the copied data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81a635b6eccd6fc889f6d07ab9583b705f739ce1
