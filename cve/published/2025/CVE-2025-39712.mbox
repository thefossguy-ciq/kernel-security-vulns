Subject: CVE-2025-39712: media: mt9m114: Fix deadlock in get_frame_interval/set_frame_interval

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mt9m114: Fix deadlock in get_frame_interval/set_frame_interval

Getting / Setting the frame interval using the V4L2 subdev pad ops
get_frame_interval/set_frame_interval causes a deadlock, as the
subdev state is locked in the [1] but also in the driver itself.

In [2] it's described that the caller is responsible to acquire and
release the lock in this case. Therefore, acquiring the lock in the
driver is wrong.

Remove the lock acquisitions/releases from mt9m114_ifp_get_frame_interval()
and mt9m114_ifp_set_frame_interval().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
