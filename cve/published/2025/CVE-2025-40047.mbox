Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/waitid: always prune wait queue entry in io_waitid_wait()

For a successful return, always remove our entry from the wait queue
entry list. Previously this was skipped if a cancelation was in
progress, but this can race with another invocation of the wait queue
entry callback.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40047 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
