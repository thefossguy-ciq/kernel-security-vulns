Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: phy: isp1301: fix non-OF device reference imbalance

A recent change fixing a device reference leak in a UDC driver
introduced a potential use-after-free in the non-OF case as the
isp1301_get_client() helper only increases the reference count for the
returned I2C device in the OF case.

Increment the reference count also for non-OF so that the caller can
decrement it unconditionally.

Note that this is inherently racy just as using the returned I2C device
is since nothing is preventing the PHY driver from being unbound while
in use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71145 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.10.248 with commit 21c7c83d592e6335bfb6d65608da3726f976bad4

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-71145
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/usb/phy/phy-isp1301.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
