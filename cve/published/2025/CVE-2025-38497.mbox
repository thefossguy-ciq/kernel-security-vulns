Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: configfs: Fix OOB read on empty string write

When writing an empty string to either 'qw_sign' or 'landingPage'
sysfs attributes, the store functions attempt to access page[l - 1]
before validating that the length 'l' is greater than zero.

This patch fixes the vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning
of os_desc_qw_sign_store() and webusb_landingPage_store() to handle
the zero-length input case gracefully by returning immediately.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38497 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
