Subject: CVE-2025-71237: nilfs2: Fix potential block overflow that cause system hang

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: Fix potential block overflow that cause system hang

When a user executes the FITRIM command, an underflow can occur when
calculating nblocks if end_block is too small. Since nblocks is of
type sector_t, which is u64, a negative nblocks value will become a
very large positive integer. This ultimately leads to the block layer
function __blkdev_issue_discard() taking an excessively long time to
process the bio chain, and the ns_segctor_sem lock remains held for a
long period. This prevents other tasks from acquiring the ns_segctor_sem
lock, resulting in the hang reported by syzbot in [1].

If the ending block is too small, typically if it is smaller than 4KiB
range, depending on the usage of the segment 0, it may be possible to
attempt a discard request beyond the device size causing the hang.

Exiting successfully and assign the discarded size (0 in this case)
to range->len.

Although the start and len values in the user input range are too small,
a conservative strategy is adopted here to safely ignore them, which is
equivalent to a no-op; it will not perform any trimming and will not
throw an error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
