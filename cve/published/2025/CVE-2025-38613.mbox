Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: gpib: fix unset padding field copy back to userspace

The introduction of a padding field in the gpib_board_info_ioctl is
showing up as initialized data on the stack frame being copyied back
to userspace in function board_info_ioctl. The simplest fix is to
initialize the entire struct to zero to ensure all unassigned padding
fields are zero'd before being copied back to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38613 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19dedd4f70f5a6505e7c601ef7dd40542d1d9aa5
