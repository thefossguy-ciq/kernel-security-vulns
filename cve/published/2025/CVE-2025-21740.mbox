Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/mmu: Ensure NX huge page recovery thread is alive before waking

When waking a VM's NX huge page recovery thread, ensure the thread is
actually alive before trying to wake it.  Now that the thread is spawned
on-demand during KVM_RUN, a VM without a recovery thread is reachable via
the related module params.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b3928b7c896e5a9fb6b1373924adafe8e01a0c6
