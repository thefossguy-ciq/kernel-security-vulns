Subject: CVE-2025-68221: mptcp: fix address removal logic in mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix address removal logic in mptcp_pm_nl_rm_addr

Fix inverted WARN_ON_ONCE condition that prevented normal address
removal counter updates. The current code only executes decrement
logic when the counter is already 0 (abnormal state), while
normal removals (counter > 0) are ignored.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68221 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
