Subject: CVE-2025-40138: f2fs: fix to avoid NULL pointer dereference in f2fs_check_quota_consistency()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid NULL pointer dereference in f2fs_check_quota_consistency()

syzbot reported a f2fs bug as below:

Oops: gen[  107.736417][ T5848] Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI

The direct reason is f2fs_check_quota_consistency() may suffer null-ptr-deref
issue in strcmp().

The bug can be reproduced w/ below scripts:
mkfs.f2fs -f /dev/vdb
mount -t f2fs -o usrquota /dev/vdb /mnt/f2fs
quotacheck -uc /mnt/f2fs/
umount /mnt/f2fs
mount -t f2fs -o usrjquota=aquota.user,jqfmt=vfsold /dev/vdb /mnt/f2fs
mount -t f2fs -o remount,usrjquota=,jqfmt=vfsold /dev/vdb /mnt/f2fs
umount /mnt/f2fs

So, before old_qname and new_qname comparison, we need to check whether
they are all valid pointers, fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
