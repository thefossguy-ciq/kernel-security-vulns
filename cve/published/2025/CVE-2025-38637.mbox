Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: skbprio: Remove overly strict queue assertions

In the current implementation, skbprio enqueue/dequeue contains an assertion
that fails under certain conditions when SKBPRIO is used as a child qdisc under
TBF with specific parameters. The failure occurs because TBF sometimes peeks at
packets in the child qdisc without actually dequeuing them when tokens are
unavailable.

This peek operation creates a discrepancy between the parent and child qdisc
queue length counters. When TBF later receives a high-priority packet,
SKBPRIO's queue length may show a different value than what's reflected in its
internal priority queue tracking, triggering the assertion.

The fix removes this overly strict assertions in SKBPRIO, they are not
necessary at all.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38637 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
