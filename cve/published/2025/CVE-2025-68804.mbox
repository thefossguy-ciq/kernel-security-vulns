Subject: CVE-2025-68804: platform/chrome: cros_ec_ishtp: Fix UAF after unbinding driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/chrome: cros_ec_ishtp: Fix UAF after unbinding driver

After unbinding the driver, another kthread `cros_ec_console_log_work`
is still accessing the device, resulting an UAF and crash.

The driver doesn't unregister the EC device in .remove() which should
shutdown sub-devices synchronously.  Fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68804 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
