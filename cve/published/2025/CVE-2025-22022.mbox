Subject: CVE-2025-22022: usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop
bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed
Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was
received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:

[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0
[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]
[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]

It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in
page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

[ 7.041671] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0
[ 7.041999] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ff1e8fe0

[ 7.042259] xhci_hcd: WARN: buffer overrun event for slot 1 ep 2 on endpoint

At some point completion events change from Isoch Buffer Overrun to
Short Packet and the HC finally finds cycle bit mismatch in ff1ec000.

[ 7.098130] xhci_hcd: ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD ep_index 2 comp_code 13
[ 7.098132] xhci_hcd: Looking for event-dma 00000000ff1ecc50 trb-start 00000000ff1e6820 trb-end 00000000ff1e6820

[ 7.098379] xhci_hcd: Overrun event on slot 1 ep 2

It's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending TDs on other endpoints (either IN or OUT),
other devices or even other HCs in the same IOMMU domain.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it
caused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk
was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to
starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial "PCIe splitter" board.

[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd
[ 7.178990] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 UNKNOWN(0x2003) Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK cmd_age=0s

[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0

Fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if
it's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports
tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining
Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

No negative side effects seen in UVC recording and UAC playback with a
few devices at full speed, high speed and SuperSpeed.

The problem doesn't reproduce on the newer Renesas uPD720201/uPD720202
and on old Etron EJ168 and VIA VL805 (but the VL805 has other bug).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
