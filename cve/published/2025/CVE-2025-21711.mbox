Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/rose: prevent integer overflows in rose_setsockopt()

In case of possible unpredictably large arguments passed to
rose_setsockopt() and multiplied by extra values on top of that,
integer overflows may occur.

Do the safest minimum and fix these issues by checking the
contents of 'opt' and returning -EINVAL if they are too large. Also,
switch to unsigned int and remove useless check for negative 'opt'
in ROSE_IDLE case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
