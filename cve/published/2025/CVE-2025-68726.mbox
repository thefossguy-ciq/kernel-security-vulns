Subject: CVE-2025-68726: crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aead - Fix reqsize handling

Commit afddce13ce81d ("crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg")
introduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type
specific reqsize fields. It looks like this was introduced specifically
for ahash and acomp from the commit description as subsequent commits
add necessary changes in these alg frameworks.

However, this is being recommended for use in all crypto algs
instead of setting reqsize using crypto_*_set_reqsize(). Using
cra_reqsize in aead algorithms, hence, causes memory corruptions and
crashes as the underlying functions in the algorithm framework have not
been updated to set the reqsize properly from cra_reqsize. [1]

Add proper set_reqsize calls in the aead init function to properly
initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
