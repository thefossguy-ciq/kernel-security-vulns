Subject: CVE-2025-37914: net_sched: ets: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: ets: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc

As described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netem
child qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.
In the case of ets, there won't be a UAF, but the code will add the same
classifier to the list twice, which will cause memory corruption.

In addition to checking for qlen being zero, this patch checks whether
the class was already added to the active_list (cl_is_active) before
doing the addition to cater for the reentrant case.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
