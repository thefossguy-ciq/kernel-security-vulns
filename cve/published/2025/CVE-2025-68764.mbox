Subject: CVE-2025-68764: NFS: Automounted filesystems should inherit ro,noexec,nodev,sync flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Automounted filesystems should inherit ro,noexec,nodev,sync flags

When a filesystem is being automounted, it needs to preserve the
user-set superblock mount options, such as the "ro" flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68764 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
