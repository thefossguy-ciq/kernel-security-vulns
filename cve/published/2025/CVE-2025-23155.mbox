Subject: CVE-2025-23155: net: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint

The cpumask should not be a local variable, since its pointer is saved
to irq_desc and may be accessed from procfs.
To fix it, use the persistent mask cpumask_of(cpu#).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23155 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
