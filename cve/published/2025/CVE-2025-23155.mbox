Subject: CVE-2025-23155: net: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: Fix accessing freed irq affinity_hint

In stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi(), a pointer to the stack variable
cpu_mask is passed to irq_set_affinity_hint(). This value is stored in
irq_desc->affinity_hint, but once stmmac_request_irq_multi_msi()
returns, the pointer becomes dangling.

The affinity_hint is exposed via procfs with S_IRUGO permissions,
allowing any unprivileged process to read it. Accessing this stale
pointer can lead to:

- a kernel oops or panic if the referenced memory has been released and
  unmapped, or
- leakage of kernel data into userspace if the memory is re-used for
  other purposes.

All platforms that use stmmac with PCI MSI (Intel, Loongson, etc) are
affected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23155 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
