Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/kmemleak: avoid deadlock by moving pr_warn() outside kmemleak_lock

When netpoll is enabled, calling pr_warn_once() while holding
kmemleak_lock in mem_pool_alloc() can cause a deadlock due to lock
inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because
pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to
__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire
kmemleak_lock.

This is the path for the deadlock.

mem_pool_alloc()
  -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);
      -> pr_warn_once()
          -> netconsole subsystem
	     -> netpoll
	         -> __alloc_skb
		   -> __create_object
		     -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);

Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() after
kmemleak_lock is released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
