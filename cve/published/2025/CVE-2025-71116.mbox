Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libceph: make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps

If the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted such that the encoded length
of ceph_pg_pool envelope is less than what is expected for a particular
encoding version, out-of-bounds reads may ensue because the only bounds
check that is there is based on that length value.

This patch adds explicit bounds checks for each field that is decoded
or skipped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71116 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
