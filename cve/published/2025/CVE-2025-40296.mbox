Subject: CVE-2025-40296: platform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: int3472: Fix double free of GPIO device during unregister

regulator_unregister() already frees the associated GPIO device. On
ThinkPad X9 (Lunar Lake), this causes a double free issue that leads to
random failures when other drivers (typically Intel THC) attempt to
allocate interrupts. The root cause is that the reference count of the
pinctrl_intel_platform module unexpectedly drops to zero when this
driver defers its probe.

This behavior can also be reproduced by unloading the module directly.

Fix the issue by removing the redundant release of the GPIO device
during regulator unregistration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40296 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/platform/x86/intel/int3472/clk_and_regulator.c
	include/linux/platform_data/x86/int3472.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b8113bb56c45bd17bac5144b55591f9cdbd6aabe
