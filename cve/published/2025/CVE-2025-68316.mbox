Subject: CVE-2025-68316: scsi: ufs: core: Fix invalid probe error return value

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix invalid probe error return value

After DME Link Startup, the error return value is set to the MIPI UniPro
GenericErrorCode which can be 0 (SUCCESS) or 1 (FAILURE).  Upon failure
during driver probe, the error code 1 is propagated back to the driver
probe function which must return a negative value to indicate an error,
but 1 is not negative, so the probe is considered to be successful even
though it failed.  Subsequently, removing the driver results in an oops
because it is not in a valid state.

This happens because none of the callers of ufshcd_init() expect a
non-negative error code.

Fix the return value and documentation to match actual usage.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68316 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
