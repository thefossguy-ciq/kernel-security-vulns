Subject: CVE-2025-38204: jfs: fix array-index-out-of-bounds read in add_missing_indices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix array-index-out-of-bounds read in add_missing_indices

stbl is s8 but it must contain offsets into slot which can go from 0 to
127.

Added a bound check for that error and return -EIO if the check fails.
Also make jfs_readdir return with error if add_missing_indices returns
with an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38204 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
