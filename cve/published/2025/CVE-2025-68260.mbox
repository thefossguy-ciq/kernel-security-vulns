Subject: CVE-2025-68260: rust_binder: fix race condition on death_list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rust_binder: fix race condition on death_list

Rust Binder contains the following unsafe operation:

	// SAFETY: A `NodeDeath` is never inserted into the death list
	// of any node other than its owner, so it is either in this
	// death list or in no death list.
	unsafe { node_inner.death_list.remove(self) };

This operation is unsafe because when touching the prev/next pointers of
a list element, we have to ensure that no other thread is also touching
them in parallel. If the node is present in the list that `remove` is
called on, then that is fine because we have exclusive access to that
list. If the node is not in any list, then it's also ok. But if it's
present in a different list that may be accessed in parallel, then that
may be a data race on the prev/next pointers.

And unfortunately that is exactly what is happening here. In
Node::release, we:

 1. Take the lock.
 2. Move all items to a local list on the stack.
 3. Drop the lock.
 4. Iterate the local list on the stack.

Combined with threads using the unsafe remove method on the original
list, this leads to memory corruption of the prev/next pointers. This
leads to crashes like this one:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3428831264096d32f830a7fcfc7885dd263e511a
