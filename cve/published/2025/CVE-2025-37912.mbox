Subject: CVE-2025-37912: ice: Check VF VSI Pointer Value in ice_vc_add_fdir_fltr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Check VF VSI Pointer Value in ice_vc_add_fdir_fltr()

As mentioned in the commit baeb705fd6a7 ("ice: always check VF VSI
pointer values"), we need to perform a null pointer check on the return
value of ice_get_vf_vsi() before using it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37912 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
