Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: Fix potential use-after-free in sama5d2_adc driver

at91_adc_interrupt can call at91_adc_touch_data_handler function
to start the work by schedule_work(&st->touch_st.workq).

If we remove the module which will call at91_adc_remove to
make cleanup, it will free indio_dev through iio_device_unregister but
quite a bit later. While the work mentioned above will be used. The
sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                      CPU1

                                     | at91_adc_workq_handler
at91_adc_remove                      |
iio_device_unregister(indio_dev)     |
//free indio_dev a bit later         |
                                     | iio_push_to_buffers(indio_dev)
                                     | //use indio_dev

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with
the cleanup in at91_adc_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71199 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
