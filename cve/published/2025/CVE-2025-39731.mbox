Subject: CVE-2025-39731: f2fs: vm_unmap_ram() may be called from an invalid context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: vm_unmap_ram() may be called from an invalid context

When testing F2FS with xfstests using UFS backed virtual disks the
kernel complains sometimes that f2fs_release_decomp_mem() calls
vm_unmap_ram() from an invalid context. Example trace from
f2fs/007 test:

This patch modifies in_task() check inside f2fs_read_end_io() to also
check if interrupts are disabled. This ensures that pages are unmapped
asynchronously in an interrupt handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
