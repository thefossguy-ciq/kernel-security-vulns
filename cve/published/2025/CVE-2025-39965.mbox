Subject: CVE-2025-39965: xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn't use 0 as SPI

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn't use 0 as SPI

x->id.spi == 0 means "no SPI assigned", but since commit
94f39804d891 ("xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling"), we now create states
and add them to the byspi list with this value.

__xfrm_state_delete doesn't remove those states from the byspi list,
since they shouldn't be there, and this shows up as a UAF the next
time we go through the byspi list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39965 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
