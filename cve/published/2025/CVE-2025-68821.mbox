Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: fix readahead reclaim deadlock

Commit e26ee4efbc79 ("fuse: allocate ff->release_args only if release is
needed") skips allocating ff->release_args if the server does not
implement open. However in doing so, fuse_prepare_release() now skips
grabbing the reference on the inode, which makes it possible for an
inode to be evicted from the dcache while there are inflight readahead
requests. This causes a deadlock if the server triggers reclaim while
servicing the readahead request and reclaim attempts to evict the inode
of the file being read ahead. Since the folio is locked during
readahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()
attempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page
cache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting
for the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is
itself blocked in reclaim:

Fix this deadlock by allocating ff->release_args and grabbing the
reference on the inode when preparing the file for release even if the
server does not implement open. The inode reference will be dropped when
the last reference on the fuse file is dropped (see fuse_file_put() ->
fuse_release_end()).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68821 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
