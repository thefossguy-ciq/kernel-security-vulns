Subject: CVE-2025-38092: ksmbd: use list_first_entry_or_null for opinfo_get_list()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: use list_first_entry_or_null for opinfo_get_list()

The list_first_entry() macro never returns NULL.  If the list is
empty then it returns an invalid pointer.  Use list_first_entry_or_null()
to check if the list is empty.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
