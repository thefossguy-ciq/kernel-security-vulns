Subject: CVE-2025-39974: tracing/osnoise: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in _parse_integer_limit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/osnoise: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in _parse_integer_limit()

When config osnoise cpus by write() syscall, the following KASAN splat may
be observed:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _parse_integer_limit+0x103/0x130

This issue can be reproduced by below code:

const char *cpulist = "1";
int fd=open("/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/osnoise/cpus", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, cpulist, strlen(cpulist));

Function bitmap_parselist() was called to parse cpulist, it require that
the parameter 'buf' must be terminated with a '\0' or '\n'. Fix this issue
by adding a '\0' to 'buf' in osnoise_cpus_write().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39974 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/930cb05a9e107777316b3ccf37f9556366669065
