Subject: CVE-2025-40101: btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data profile without an RST

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix memory leaks when rejecting a non SINGLE data profile without an RST

At the end of btrfs_load_block_group_zone_info() the first thing we do
is to ensure that if the mapping type is not a SINGLE one and there is
no RAID stripe tree, then we return early with an error.

Doing that, though, prevents the code from running the last calls from
this function which are about freeing memory allocated during its
run. Hence, in this case, instead of returning early, we set the ret
value and fall through the rest of the cleanup code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
