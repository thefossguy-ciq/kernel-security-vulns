Subject: CVE-2025-38015: dmaengine: idxd: fix memory leak in error handling path of idxd_alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: fix memory leak in error handling path of idxd_alloc

Memory allocated for idxd is not freed if an error occurs during
idxd_alloc(). To fix it, free the allocated memory in the reverse order
of allocation before exiting the function in case of an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
