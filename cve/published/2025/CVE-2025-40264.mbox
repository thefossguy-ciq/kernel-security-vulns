Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

be2net: pass wrb_params in case of OS2BMC

be_insert_vlan_in_pkt() is called with the wrb_params argument being NULL
at be_send_pkt_to_bmc() call site.  This may lead to dereferencing a NULL
pointer when processing a workaround for specific packet, as commit
bc0c3405abbb ("be2net: fix a Tx stall bug caused by a specific ipv6
packet") states.

The correct way would be to pass the wrb_params from be_xmit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40264 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
