Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix UAF in __close_file_table_ids

A use-after-free is possible if one thread destroys the file
via __ksmbd_close_fd while another thread holds a reference to
it. The existing checks on fp->refcount are not sufficient to
prevent this.

The fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes the
file from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the
same file pointer via __close_file_table_ids, as well as the other
functions which retrieve a file from the IDR and which already use
this same lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
