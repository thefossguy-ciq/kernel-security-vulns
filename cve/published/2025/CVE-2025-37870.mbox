Subject: CVE-2025-37870: drm/amd/display: prevent hang on link training fail

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: prevent hang on link training fail

[Why]
When link training fails, the phy clock will be disabled. However, in
enable_streams, it is assumed that link training succeeded and the
mux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.

[How]
When enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall
back to the ref clock to avoid a hang and keep the system in a recoverable
state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37870 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
