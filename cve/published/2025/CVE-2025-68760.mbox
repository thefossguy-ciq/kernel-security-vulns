Subject: CVE-2025-68760: iommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show

In iommu_mmio_write(), it validates the user-provided offset with the
check: `iommu->dbg_mmio_offset > iommu->mmio_phys_end - 4`.
This assumes a 4-byte access. However, the corresponding
show handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte
(64-bit) read.

If a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check
passes, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.

Fix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which
corresponds to the size of the readq() operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68760 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
