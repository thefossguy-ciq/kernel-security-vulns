Subject: CVE-2025-39887: tracing/osnoise: Fix null-ptr-deref in bitmap_parselist()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/osnoise: Fix null-ptr-deref in bitmap_parselist()

A crash was observed with the following output:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010
Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI
CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 92 Comm: osnoise_cpus Not tainted 6.17.0-rc4-00201-gd69eb204c255 #138 PREEMPT(voluntary)
RIP: 0010:bitmap_parselist+0x53/0x3e0
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 </TASK>

This issue can be reproduced by below code:

fd=open("/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/osnoise/cpus", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "0-2", 0);

When user pass 'count=0' to osnoise_cpus_write(), kmalloc() will return
ZERO_SIZE_PTR (16) and cpulist_parse() treat it as a normal value, which
trigger the null pointer dereference. Add check for the parameter 'count'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e33228a2cc7ff706ca88533464e8a3b525b961ed
