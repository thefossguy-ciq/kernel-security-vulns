Subject: CVE-2025-38737: cifs: Fix oops due to uninitialised variable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix oops due to uninitialised variable

Fix smb3_init_transform_rq() to initialise buffer to NULL before calling
netfs_alloc_folioq_buffer() as netfs assumes it can append to the buffer it
is given.  Setting it to NULL means it should start a fresh buffer, but the
value is currently undefined.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38737 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
