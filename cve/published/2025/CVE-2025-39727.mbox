Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: swap: fix potential buffer overflow in setup_clusters()

In setup_swap_map(), we only ensure badpages are in range (0, last_page]. 
As maxpages might be < last_page, setup_clusters() will encounter a buffer
overflow when a badpage is >= maxpages.

Only call inc_cluster_info_page() for badpage which is < maxpages to fix
the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39727 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
