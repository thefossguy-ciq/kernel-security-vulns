Subject: CVE-2025-23157: media: venus: hfi_parser: add check to avoid out of bound access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: hfi_parser: add check to avoid out of bound access

There is a possibility that init_codecs is invoked multiple times during
manipulated payload from video firmware. In such case, if codecs_count
can get incremented to value more than MAX_CODEC_NUM, there can be OOB
access. Reset the count so that it always starts from beginning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23157 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
