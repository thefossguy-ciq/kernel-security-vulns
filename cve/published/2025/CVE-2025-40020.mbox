Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: peak_usb: fix shift-out-of-bounds issue

Explicitly uses a 64-bit constant when the number of bits used for its
shifting is 32 (which is the case for PC CAN FD interfaces supported by
this driver).

[mkl: update subject, apply manually]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
