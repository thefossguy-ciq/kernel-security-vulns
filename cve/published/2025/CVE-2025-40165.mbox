Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: nxp: imx8-isi: m2m: Fix streaming cleanup on release

If streamon/streamoff calls are imbalanced, such as when exiting an
application with Ctrl+C when streaming, the m2m usage_count will never
reach zero and the ISI channel won't be freed. Besides from that, if the
input line width is more than 2K, it will trigger a WARN_ON():

Address this issue by moving the streaming preparation and cleanup to
the vb2 .prepare_streaming() and .unprepare_streaming() operations. This
also simplifies the driver by allowing direct usage of the
v4l2_m2m_ioctl_streamon() and v4l2_m2m_ioctl_streamoff() helpers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40165 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
