Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: make rdev_addable usable for rcu mode

Our testcase trigger panic:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000e0
...
Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI
CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 85 Comm: kworker/2:1 Not tainted 6.16.0+ #94
PREEMPT(none)
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS

md_spares_need_change in md_start_sync will call rdev_addable which
protected by rcu_read_lock/rcu_read_unlock. This rcu context will help
protect rdev won't be released, but rdev->mddev will be set to NULL
before we call synchronize_rcu in md_kick_rdev_from_array. Fix this by
using READ_ONCE and check does rdev->mddev still alive.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38621 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
