Subject: CVE-2025-38132: coresight: holding cscfg_csdev_lock while removing cscfg from csdev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: holding cscfg_csdev_lock while removing cscfg from csdev

There'll be possible race scenario for coresight config:

CPU0                                          CPU1
(perf enable)                                 load module
                                              cscfg_load_config_sets()
                                              activate config. // sysfs
                                              (sys_active_cnt == 1)
...
cscfg_csdev_enable_active_config()
  lock(csdev->cscfg_csdev_lock)
                                              deactivate config // sysfs
                                              (sys_activec_cnt == 0)
                                              cscfg_unload_config_sets()
  <iterating config_csdev_list>               cscfg_remove_owned_csdev_configs()
  // here load config activate by CPU1
  unlock(csdev->cscfg_csdev_lock)

iterating config_csdev_list could be raced with config_csdev_list's
entry delete.

To resolve this race , hold csdev->cscfg_csdev_lock() while
cscfg_remove_owned_csdev_configs()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/42f8afb0b161631fd1d814d017f75f955475ad41
