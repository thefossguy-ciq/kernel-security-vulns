Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in ksmbd_free_work_struct

->interim_entry of ksmbd_work could be deleted after oplock is freed.
We don't need to manage it with linked list. The interim request could be
immediately sent whenever a oplock break wait is needed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
