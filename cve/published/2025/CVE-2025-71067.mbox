Subject: CVE-2025-71067: ntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting

When mounting, sb->s_blocksize is used to read the boot_block without
being defined or validated. Set a dummy blocksize before attempting to
read the boot_block.

The issue can be triggered with the following syz reproducer:

  mkdirat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='./file1\x00', 0x0)
  r4 = openat$nullb(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000040), 0x121403, 0x0)
  ioctl$FS_IOC_SETFLAGS(r4, 0x40081271, &(0x7f0000000980)=0x4000)
  mount(&(0x7f0000000140)=@nullb, &(0x7f0000000040)='./cgroup\x00',
        &(0x7f0000000000)='ntfs3\x00', 0x2208004, 0x0)
  syz_clone(0x88200200, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)

Here, the ioctl sets the bdev block size to 16384. During mount,
get_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),
but since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves
sb->s_blocksize at zero.

Later, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while
sb->s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
