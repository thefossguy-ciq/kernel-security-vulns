Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tegra: Fix a possible null pointer dereference

In tegra_crtc_reset(), new memory is allocated with kzalloc(), but
no check is performed. Before calling __drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset,
state should be checked to prevent possible null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38363 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
