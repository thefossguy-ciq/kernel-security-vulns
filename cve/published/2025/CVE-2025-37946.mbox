Subject: CVE-2025-37946: s390/pci: Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pci: Fix duplicate pci_dev_put() in disable_slot() when PF has child VFs

With commit bcb5d6c76903 ("s390/pci: introduce lock to synchronize state
of zpci_dev's") the code to ignore power off of a PF that has child VFs
was changed from a direct return to a goto to the unlock and
pci_dev_put() section. The change however left the existing pci_dev_put()
untouched resulting in a doubple put. This can subsequently cause a use
after free if the struct pci_dev is released in an unexpected state.
Fix this by removing the extra pci_dev_put().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37946 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
