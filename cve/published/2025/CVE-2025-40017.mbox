Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: iris: Fix memory leak by freeing untracked persist buffer

One internal buffer which is allocated only once per session was not
being freed during session close because it was not being tracked as
part of internal buffer list which resulted in a memory leak.

Add the necessary logic to explicitly free the untracked internal buffer
during session close to ensure all allocated memory is released
properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
