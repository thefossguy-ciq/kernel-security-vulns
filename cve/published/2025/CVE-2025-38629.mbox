Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb: scarlett2: Fix missing NULL check

scarlett2_input_select_ctl_info() sets up the string arrays allocated
via kasprintf(), but it misses NULL checks, which may lead to NULL
dereference Oops.  Let's add the proper NULL check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38629 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
