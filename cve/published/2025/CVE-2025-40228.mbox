Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs: catch commit test ctx alloc failure

Patch series "mm/damon/sysfs: fix commit test damon_ctx [de]allocation".

DAMON sysfs interface dynamically allocates and uses a damon_ctx object
for testing if given inputs for online DAMON parameters update is valid.
The object is being used without an allocation failure check, and leaked
when the test succeeds.  Fix the two bugs.


This patch (of 2):

The damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is used
without its allocation failure check.  This could result in an invalid
memory access.  Fix it by directly returning an error when the allocation
failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b3609d9b9650bdea0bfdf643e0ce57e1aed67fc
