Subject: CVE-2025-38408: genirq/irq_sim: Initialize work context pointers properly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genirq/irq_sim: Initialize work context pointers properly

Initialize `ops` member's pointers properly by using kzalloc() instead of
kmalloc() when allocating the simulation work context. Otherwise the
pointers contain random content leading to invalid dereferencing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38408 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
