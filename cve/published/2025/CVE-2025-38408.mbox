Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genirq/irq_sim: Initialize work context pointers properly

Initialize `ops` member's pointers properly by using kzalloc() instead of
kmalloc() when allocating the simulation work context. Otherwise the
pointers contain random content leading to invalid dereferencing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38408 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.37 with commit 19bd7597858dd15802c1d99fcc38e528f469080a
	Fixed in 6.15.6 with commit 7f73d1def72532bac4d55ea8838f457a6bed955c
	Fixed in 6.16-rc3 with commit 8a2277a3c9e4cc5398f80821afe7ecbe9bdf2819

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-38408
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/irq/irq_sim.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19bd7597858dd15802c1d99fcc38e528f469080a
