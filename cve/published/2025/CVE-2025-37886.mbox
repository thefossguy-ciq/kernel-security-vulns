Subject: CVE-2025-37886: pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info

Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather
than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()
is done so that the context is still available after the wait
loop has given up.

There was a case where a slow development firmware caused
the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally
finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried
to complete_all() the completion context that had been created
on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.
This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37886 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
