Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sysfb: Do not dereference NULL pointer in plane reset

The plane state in __drm_gem_reset_shadow_plane() can be NULL. Do not
deref that pointer, but forward NULL to the other plane-reset helpers.
Clears plane->state to NULL.

v2:
- fix typo in commit description (Javier)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40360 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
