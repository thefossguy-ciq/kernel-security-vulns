Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: make sure ptp clock is unregister and freed if hclge_ptp_get_cycle returns an error

During the initialization of ptp, hclge_ptp_get_cycle might return an error
and returned directly without unregister clock and free it. To avoid that,
call hclge_ptp_destroy_clock to unregist and free clock if
hclge_ptp_get_cycle failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
