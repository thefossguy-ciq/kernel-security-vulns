Subject: CVE-2025-68243: NFS: Check the TLS certificate fields in nfs_match_client()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Check the TLS certificate fields in nfs_match_client()

If the TLS security policy is of type RPC_XPRTSEC_TLS_X509, then the
cert_serial and privkey_serial fields need to match as well since they
define the client's identity, as presented to the server.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68243 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
