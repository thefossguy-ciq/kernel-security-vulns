Subject: CVE-2025-22122: block: fix adding folio to bio

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix adding folio to bio

>4GB folio is possible on some ARCHs, such as aarch64, 16GB hugepage
is supported, then 'offset' of folio can't be held in 'unsigned int',
cause warning in bio_add_folio_nofail() and IO failure.

Fix it by adjusting 'page' & trimming 'offset' so that `->bi_offset` won't
be overflow, and folio can be added to bio successfully.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22122 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
