Subject: CVE-2025-38533: net: libwx: fix the using of Rx buffer DMA

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: libwx: fix the using of Rx buffer DMA

The wx_rx_buffer structure contained two DMA address fields: 'dma' and
'page_dma'. However, only 'page_dma' was actually initialized and used
to program the Rx descriptor. But 'dma' was uninitialized and used in
some paths.

This could lead to undefined behavior, including DMA errors or
use-after-free, if the uninitialized 'dma' was used. Althrough such
error has not yet occurred, it is worth fixing in the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38533 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
