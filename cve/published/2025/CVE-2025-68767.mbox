Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk

syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when
the S_IFMT bits of the 16bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

According to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS
8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized
with 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when
the "mode" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be
S_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/
S_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir == 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68767 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
