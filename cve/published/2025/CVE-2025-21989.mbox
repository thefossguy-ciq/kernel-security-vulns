Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix missing .is_two_pixels_per_container

Starting from 6.11, AMDGPU driver, while being loaded with amdgpu.dc=1,
due to lack of .is_two_pixels_per_container function in dce60_tg_funcs,
causes a NULL pointer dereference on PCs with old GPUs, such as R9 280X.

So this fix adds missing .is_two_pixels_per_container to dce60_tg_funcs.

(cherry picked from commit bd4b125eb949785c6f8a53b0494e32795421209d)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21989 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
