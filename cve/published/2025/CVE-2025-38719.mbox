Subject: CVE-2025-38719: net: hibmcge: fix the division by zero issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hibmcge: fix the division by zero issue

When the network port is down, the queue is released, and ring->len is 0.
In debugfs, hbg_get_queue_used_num() will be called,
which may lead to a division by zero issue.

This patch adds a check, if ring->len is 0,
hbg_get_queue_used_num() directly returns 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38719 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
