Subject: CVE-2025-39856: net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix null pointer dereference for ndev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Fix null pointer dereference for ndev

In the TX completion packet stage of TI SoCs with CPSW2G instance, which
has single external ethernet port, ndev is accessed without being
initialized if no TX packets have been processed. It results into null
pointer dereference, causing kernel to crash. Fix this by having a check
on the number of TX packets which have been processed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39856 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
