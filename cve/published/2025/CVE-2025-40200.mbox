Subject: CVE-2025-40200: Squashfs: reject negative file sizes in squashfs_read_inode()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: reject negative file sizes in squashfs_read_inode()

Syskaller reports a "WARNING in ovl_copy_up_file" in overlayfs.

This warning is ultimately caused because the underlying Squashfs file
system returns a file with a negative file size.

This commit checks for a negative file size and returns EINVAL.

[phillip@squashfs.org.uk: only need to check 64 bit quantity]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40200 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
