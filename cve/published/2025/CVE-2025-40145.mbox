Subject: CVE-2025-40145: PCI/pwrctrl: Fix double cleanup on devm_add_action_or_reset() failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/pwrctrl: Fix double cleanup on devm_add_action_or_reset() failure

When devm_add_action_or_reset() fails, it calls the passed cleanup
function.  Hence the caller must not repeat that cleanup.

Replace the "goto err_regulator_free" by the actual freeing, as there
will never be a need again for a second user of this label.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40145 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77732c58fef6247b71493dc3997af0ec0aaad5c7
