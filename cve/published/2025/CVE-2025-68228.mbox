Subject: CVE-2025-68228: drm/plane: Fix create_in_format_blob() return value

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/plane: Fix create_in_format_blob() return value

create_in_format_blob() is either supposed to return a valid
pointer or an error, but never NULL. The caller will dereference
the blob when it is not an error, and thus will oops if NULL
returned. Return proper error values in the failure cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/860f93f4fce1e733b8a2474f6bfa153243d775f3
