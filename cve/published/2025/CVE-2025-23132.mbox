Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: quota: fix to avoid warning in dquot_writeback_dquots()

F2FS-fs (dm-59): checkpoint=enable has some unwritten data.

checkpoint and f2fs_remount may race as below, resulting triggering warning
in dquot_writeback_dquots().

atomic write                                    remount
                                                - do_remount
                                                 - down_write(&sb->s_umount);
                                                  - f2fs_remount
- ioctl
 - f2fs_do_sync_file
  - f2fs_sync_fs
   - f2fs_write_checkpoint
    - block_operations
     - locked = down_read_trylock(&sbi->sb->s_umount)
       : fail to lock due to the write lock was held by remount
                                                 - up_write(&sb->s_umount);
     - f2fs_quota_sync
      - dquot_writeback_dquots
       - WARN_ON_ONCE(!rwsem_is_locked(&sb->s_umount))
       : trigger warning because s_umount lock was unlocked by remount

If checkpoint comes from mount/umount/remount/freeze/quotactl, caller of
checkpoint has already held s_umount lock, calling dquot_writeback_dquots()
in the context should be safe.

So let's record task to sbi->umount_lock_holder, so that checkpoint can
know whether the lock has held in the context or not by checking current
w/ it.

In addition, in order to not misrepresent caller of checkpoint, we should
not allow to trigger async checkpoint for those callers: mount/umount/remount/
freeze/quotactl.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23132 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/f2fs/checkpoint.c
	fs/f2fs/f2fs.h
	fs/f2fs/super.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d7acf0a6c87aa282c86a36dbaa2f92fda88c5884
