Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtdchar: fix integer overflow in read/write ioctls

The "req.start" and "req.len" variables are u64 values that come from the
user at the start of the function.  We mask away the high 32 bits of
"req.len" so that's capped at U32_MAX but the "req.start" variable can go
up to U64_MAX which means that the addition can still integer overflow.

Use check_add_overflow() to fix this bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68237 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
