Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btintel: Check dsbr size from EFI variable

Since the size of struct btintel_dsbr is already known, we can just
start there instead of querying the EFI variable size. If the final
result doesn't match what we expect also fail. This fixes a stack buffer
overflow when the EFI variable is larger than struct btintel_dsbr.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38315 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
