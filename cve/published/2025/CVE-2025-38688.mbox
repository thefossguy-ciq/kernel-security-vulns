Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Prevent ALIGN() overflow

When allocating IOVA the candidate range gets aligned to the target
alignment. If the range is close to ULONG_MAX then the ALIGN() can
wrap resulting in a corrupted iova.

Open code the ALIGN() using get_add_overflow() to prevent this.
This simplifies the checks as we don't need to check for length earlier
either.

Consolidate the two copies of this code under a single helper.

This bug would allow userspace to create a mapping that overlaps with some
other mapping or a reserved range.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38688 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
