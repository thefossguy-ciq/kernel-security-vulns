Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)

Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require
finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()
does not change that.

As the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as
well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38247 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/142db4e76110dd80239f4e79810f85ea1735ad60
