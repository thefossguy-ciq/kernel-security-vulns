Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/features: Add check for no entries in cxl_feature_info

cxl EDAC calls cxl_feature_info() to get the feature information and
if the hardware has no Features support, cxlfs may be passed in as
NULL.

[   51.957498] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008

Add a check for cxlfs before dereferencing it and return -EOPNOTSUPP if
there is no cxlfs created due to no hardware support.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b8a69e3b1a460bf5d96dd53cbd121aa2cd346886
