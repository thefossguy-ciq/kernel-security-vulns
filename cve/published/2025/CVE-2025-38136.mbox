Subject: CVE-2025-38136: usb: renesas_usbhs: Reorder clock handling and power management in probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: renesas_usbhs: Reorder clock handling and power management in probe

Reorder the initialization sequence in `usbhs_probe()` to enable runtime
PM before accessing registers, preventing potential crashes due to
uninitialized clocks.

Currently, in the probe path, registers are accessed before enabling the
clocks, leading to a synchronous external abort on the RZ/V2H SoC.
The problematic call flow is as follows:

    usbhs_probe()
        usbhs_sys_clock_ctrl()
            usbhs_bset()
                usbhs_write()
                    iowrite16()  <-- Register access before enabling clocks

Since `iowrite16()` is performed without ensuring the required clocks are
enabled, this can lead to access errors. To fix this, enable PM runtime
early in the probe function and ensure clocks are acquired before register
access, preventing crashes like the following on RZ/V2H:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
