Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/ext: Prevent update_locked_rq() calls with NULL rq

Avoid invoking update_locked_rq() when the runqueue (rq) pointer is NULL
in the SCX_CALL_OP and SCX_CALL_OP_RET macros.

Previously, calling update_locked_rq(NULL) with preemption enabled could
trigger the following warning:

    BUG: using __this_cpu_write() in preemptible [00000000]

This happens because __this_cpu_write() is unsafe to use in preemptible
context.

rq is NULL when an ops invoked from an unlocked context. In such cases, we
don't need to store any rq, since the value should already be NULL
(unlocked). Ensure that update_locked_rq() is only called when rq is
non-NULL, preventing calling __this_cpu_write() on preemptible context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38522 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/237c43037b336e36a49eb9f2daac1c7719ec7f8b
