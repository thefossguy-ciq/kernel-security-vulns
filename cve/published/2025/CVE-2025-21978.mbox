Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removed

When a Hyper-V DRM device is probed, the driver allocates MMIO space for
the vram, and maps it cacheable. If the device removed, or in the error
path for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.
Consequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.

Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in the
error path during device probing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
