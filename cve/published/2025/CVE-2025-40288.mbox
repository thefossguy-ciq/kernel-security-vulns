Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices

Previously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)
triggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root
cause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,
but that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains
uninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully
set up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to
acquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to
a kernel OOPS.

1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in
   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for
   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized
   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific
   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.

2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info
   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM
   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is
   NULL.

3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)
   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the
   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set
   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).

This approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:
- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),
- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,
- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized
  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).

v4: use ttm_resource_manager_used(&adev->mman.vram_mgr.manager) instead of checking the adev->gmc.is_app_apu flag (Christian)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40288 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
