Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: account for current allocated stack depth in widen_imprecise_scalars()

The usage pattern for widen_imprecise_scalars() looks as follows:

    prev_st = find_prev_entry(env, ...);
    queued_st = push_stack(...);
    widen_imprecise_scalars(env, prev_st, queued_st);

Where prev_st is an ancestor of the queued_st in the explored states
tree. This ancestor is not guaranteed to have same allocated stack
depth as queued_st. E.g. in the following case:

    def main():
      for i in 1..2:
        foo(i)        // same callsite, differnt param

    def foo(i):
      if i == 1:
        use 128 bytes of stack
      iterator based loop

Here, for a second 'foo' call prev_st->allocated_stack is 128,
while queued_st->allocated_stack is much smaller.
widen_imprecise_scalars() needs to take this into account and avoid
accessing bpf_verifier_state->frame[*]->stack out of bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68208 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
