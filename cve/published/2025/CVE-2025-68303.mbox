Subject: CVE-2025-68303: platform/x86: intel: punit_ipc: fix memory corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: intel: punit_ipc: fix memory corruption

This passes the address of the pointer "&punit_ipcdev" when the intent
was to pass the pointer itself "punit_ipcdev" (without the ampersand).
This means that the:

	complete(&ipcdev->cmd_complete);

in intel_punit_ioc() will write to a wrong memory address corrupting it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68303 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
