Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: fix iio_chan_spec for sensors without event detection

The st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels array of struct iio_chan_spec has a non-NULL
event_spec field, indicating support for IIO events. However, event
detection is not supported for all sensors, and if userspace tries to
configure accelerometer wakeup events on a sensor device that does not
support them (e.g. LSM6DS0), st_lsm6dsx_write_event() dereferences a NULL
pointer when trying to write to the wakeup register.
Define an additional struct iio_chan_spec array whose members have a NULL
event_spec field, and use this array instead of st_lsm6dsx_acc_channels for
sensors without event detection capability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71198 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
