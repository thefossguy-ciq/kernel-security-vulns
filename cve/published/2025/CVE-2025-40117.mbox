Subject: CVE-2025-40117: misc: pci_endpoint_test: Fix array underflow in pci_endpoint_test_ioctl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: pci_endpoint_test: Fix array underflow in pci_endpoint_test_ioctl()

Commit eefb83790a0d ("misc: pci_endpoint_test: Add doorbell test case")
added NO_BAR (-1) to the pci_barno enum which, in practical terms,
changes the enum from an unsigned int to a signed int.  If the user
passes a negative number in pci_endpoint_test_ioctl() then it results in
an array underflow in pci_endpoint_test_bar().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40117 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
