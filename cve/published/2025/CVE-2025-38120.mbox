Subject: CVE-2025-38120: netfilter: nf_set_pipapo_avx2: fix initial map fill

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_set_pipapo_avx2: fix initial map fill

If the first field doesn't cover the entire start map, then we must zero
out the remainder, else we leak those bits into the next match round map.

The early fix was incomplete and did only fix up the generic C
implementation.

A followup patch adds a test case to nft_concat_range.sh.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38120 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
