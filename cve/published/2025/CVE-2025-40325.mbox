Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: wait barrier before returning discard request with REQ_NOWAIT

raid10_handle_discard should wait barrier before returning a discard bio
which has REQ_NOWAIT. And there is no need to print warning calltrace
if a discard bio has REQ_NOWAIT flag. Quality engineer usually checks
dmesg and reports error if dmesg has warning/error calltrace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40325 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
