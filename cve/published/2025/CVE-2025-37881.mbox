Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: aspeed: Add NULL pointer check in ast_vhub_init_dev()

The variable d->name, returned by devm_kasprintf(), could be NULL.
A pointer check is added to prevent potential NULL pointer dereference.
This is similar to the fix in commit 3027e7b15b02
("ice: Fix some null pointer dereference issues in ice_ptp.c").

This issue is found by our static analysis tool

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37881 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
