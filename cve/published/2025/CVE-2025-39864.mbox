Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: fix use-after-free in cmp_bss()

Following bss_free() quirk introduced in commit 776b3580178f
("cfg80211: track hidden SSID networks properly"), adjust
cfg80211_update_known_bss() to free the last beacon frame
elements only if they're not shared via the corresponding
'hidden_beacon_bss' pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
