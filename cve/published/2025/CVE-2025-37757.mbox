Subject: CVE-2025-37757: tipc: fix memory leak in tipc_link_xmit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: fix memory leak in tipc_link_xmit

In case the backlog transmit queue for system-importance messages is overloaded,
tipc_link_xmit() returns -ENOBUFS but the skb list is not purged. This leads to
memory leak and failure when a skb is allocated.

This commit fixes this issue by purging the skb list before tipc_link_xmit()
returns.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37757 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
