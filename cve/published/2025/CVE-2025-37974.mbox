Subject: CVE-2025-37974: s390/pci: Fix missing check for zpci_create_device() error return

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pci: Fix missing check for zpci_create_device() error return

The zpci_create_device() function returns an error pointer that needs to
be checked before dereferencing it as a struct zpci_dev pointer. Add the
missing check in __clp_add() where it was missed when adding the
scan_list in the fixed commit. Simply not adding the device to the scan
list results in the previous behavior.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37974 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
