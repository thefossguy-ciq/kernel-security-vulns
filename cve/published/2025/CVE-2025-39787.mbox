Subject: CVE-2025-39787: soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Ensure we don't read past the ELF header

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: mdt_loader: Ensure we don't read past the ELF header

When the MDT loader is used in remoteproc, the ELF header is sanitized
beforehand, but that's not necessary the case for other clients.

Validate the size of the firmware buffer to ensure that we don't read
past the end as we iterate over the header. e_phentsize and e_shentsize
are validated as well, to ensure that the assumptions about step size in
the traversal are valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
