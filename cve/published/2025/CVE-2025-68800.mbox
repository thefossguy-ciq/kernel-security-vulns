Subject: CVE-2025-68800: mlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats

Cited commit added a dedicated mutex (instead of RTNL) to protect the
multicast route list, so that it will not change while the driver
periodically traverses it in order to update the kernel about multicast
route stats that were queried from the device.

One instance of list entry deletion (during route replace) was missed
and it can result in a use-after-free [1].

Fix by acquiring the mutex before deleting the entry from the list and
releasing it afterwards.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
