Subject: CVE-2025-68240: nilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: avoid having an active sc_timer before freeing sci

Because kthread_stop did not stop sc_task properly and returned -EINTR,
the sc_timer was not properly closed, ultimately causing the problem [1]
reported by syzbot when freeing sci due to the sc_timer not being closed.

Because the thread sc_task main function nilfs_segctor_thread() returns 0
when it succeeds, when the return value of kthread_stop() is not 0 in
nilfs_segctor_destroy(), we believe that it has not properly closed
sc_timer.

We use timer_shutdown_sync() to sync wait for sc_timer to shutdown, and
set the value of sc_task to NULL under the protection of lock
sc_state_lock, so as to avoid the issue caused by sc_timer not being
properly shutdowned.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
