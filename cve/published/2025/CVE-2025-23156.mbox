Subject: CVE-2025-23156: media: venus: hfi_parser: refactor hfi packet parsing logic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: hfi_parser: refactor hfi packet parsing logic

words_count denotes the number of words in total payload, while data
points to payload of various property within it. When words_count
reaches last word, data can access memory beyond the total payload. This
can lead to OOB access. With this patch, the utility api for handling
individual properties now returns the size of data consumed. Accordingly
remaining bytes are calculated before parsing the payload, thereby
eliminates the OOB access possibilities.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23156 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
