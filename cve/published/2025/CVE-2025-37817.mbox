Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mcb: fix a double free bug in chameleon_parse_gdd()

In chameleon_parse_gdd(), if mcb_device_register() fails, 'mdev'
would be released in mcb_device_register() via put_device().
Thus, goto 'err' label and free 'mdev' again causes a double free.
Just return if mcb_device_register() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37817 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
