Subject: CVE-2025-68346: ALSA: dice: fix buffer overflow in detect_stream_formats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: dice: fix buffer overflow in detect_stream_formats()

The function detect_stream_formats() reads the stream_count value directly
from a FireWire device without validating it. This can lead to
out-of-bounds writes when a malicious device provides a stream_count value
greater than MAX_STREAMS.

Fix by applying the same validation to both TX and RX stream counts in
detect_stream_formats().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68346 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
