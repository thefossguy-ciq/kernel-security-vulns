Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hsr: hold rcu and dev lock for hsr_get_port_ndev

hsr_get_port_ndev calls hsr_for_each_port, which need to hold rcu lock.
On the other hand, before return the port device, we need to hold the
device reference to avoid UaF in the caller function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68a6729afd3e8e9a2a32538642ce92b96ccf9b1d
