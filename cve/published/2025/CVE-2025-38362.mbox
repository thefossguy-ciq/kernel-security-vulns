Subject: CVE-2025-38362: drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check for get_first_active_display()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check for get_first_active_display()

The function mod_hdcp_hdcp1_enable_encryption() calls the function
get_first_active_display(), but does not check its return value.
The return value is a null pointer if the display list is empty.
This will lead to a null pointer dereference in
mod_hdcp_hdcp2_enable_encryption().

Add a null pointer check for get_first_active_display() and return
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_DISPLAY_NOT_FOUND if the function return null.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38362 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
