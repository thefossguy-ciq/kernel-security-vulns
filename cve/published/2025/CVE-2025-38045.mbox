Subject: CVE-2025-38045: wifi: iwlwifi: fix debug actions order

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix debug actions order

The order of actions taken for debug was implemented incorrectly.
Now we implemented the dump split and do the FW reset only in the
middle of the dump (rather than the FW killing itself on error.)
As a result, some of the actions taken when applying the config
will now crash the device, so we need to fix the order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
