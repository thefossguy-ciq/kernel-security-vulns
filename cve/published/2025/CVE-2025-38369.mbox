Subject: CVE-2025-38369: dmaengine: idxd: Check availability of workqueue allocated by idxd wq driver before using

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Check availability of workqueue allocated by idxd wq driver before using

Running IDXD workloads in a container with the /dev directory mounted can
trigger a call trace or even a kernel panic when the parent process of the
container is terminated.

This issue occurs because, under certain configurations, Docker does not
properly propagate the mount replica back to the original mount point.

In this case, when the user driver detaches, the WQ is destroyed but it
still calls destroy_workqueue() attempting to completes all pending work.
It's necessary to check wq->wq and skip the drain if it no longer exists.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38369 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
