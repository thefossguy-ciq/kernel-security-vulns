Subject: CVE-2025-38158: hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,
if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be
updated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
