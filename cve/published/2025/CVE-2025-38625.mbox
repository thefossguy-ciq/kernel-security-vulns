Subject: CVE-2025-38625: vfio/pds: Fix missing detach_ioas op

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/pds: Fix missing detach_ioas op

When CONFIG_IOMMUFD is enabled and a device is bound to the pds_vfio_pci
driver, the following WARN_ON() trace is seen and probe fails:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5040 at drivers/vfio/vfio_main.c:317 __vfio_register_dev+0x130/0x140 [vfio]
<...>
pds_vfio_pci 0000:08:00.1: probe with driver pds_vfio_pci failed with error -22

This is because the driver's vfio_device_ops.detach_ioas isn't set.

Fix this by using the generic vfio_iommufd_physical_detach_ioas
function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38625 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
