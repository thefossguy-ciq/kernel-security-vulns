Subject: CVE-2025-71132: smc91x: fix broken irq-context in PREEMPT_RT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc91x: fix broken irq-context in PREEMPT_RT

When smc91x.c is built with PREEMPT_RT, the following splat occurs
in FVP_RevC:

[   13.055000] smc91x LNRO0003:00 eth0: link up, 10Mbps, half-duplex, lpa 0x0000
[   13.062137] BUG: workqueue leaked atomic, lock or RCU: kworker/2:1[106]
[   13.062137]      preempt=0x00000000 lock=0->0 RCU=0->1 workfn=mld_ifc_work
[   13.062266] C
** replaying previous printk message **

[   13.062382] Workqueue: mld mld_ifc_work

[   13.062710]  dump_stack_lvl+0x7c/0xb0

[   13.063043]  worker_thread+0x260/0x3d8
[   13.063124]  kthread+0x1c4/0x228
[   13.063235]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

This happens because smc_special_trylock() disables IRQs even on PREEMPT_RT,
but smc_special_unlock() does not restore IRQs on PREEMPT_RT.
The reason is that smc_special_unlock() calls spin_unlock_irqrestore(),
and rcu_read_unlock_bh() in __dev_queue_xmit() cannot invoke
rcu_read_unlock() through __local_bh_enable_ip() when current->softirq_disable_cnt becomes zero.

To address this issue, replace smc_special_trylock() with spin_trylock_irqsave().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
