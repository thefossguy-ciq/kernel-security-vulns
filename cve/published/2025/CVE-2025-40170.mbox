Subject: CVE-2025-40170: net: use dst_dev_rcu() in sk_setup_caps()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: use dst_dev_rcu() in sk_setup_caps()

Use RCU to protect accesses to dst->dev from sk_setup_caps()
and sk_dst_gso_max_size().

Also use dst_dev_rcu() in ip6_dst_mtu_maybe_forward(),
and ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward().

ip4_dst_hoplimit() can use dst_dev_net_rcu().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40170 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
