Subject: CVE-2025-38205: drm/amd/display: Avoid divide by zero by initializing dummy pitch to 1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Avoid divide by zero by initializing dummy pitch to 1

[Why]
If the dummy values in `populate_dummy_dml_surface_cfg()` aren't updated
then they can lead to a divide by zero in downstream callers like
CalculateVMAndRowBytes()

[How]
Initialize dummy value to a value to avoid divide by zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38205 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/dml2/dml2_translation_helper.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8044f981b2cf8c32fe1bd5d1fc991552cdf7ffe0
