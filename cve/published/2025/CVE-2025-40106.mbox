Subject: CVE-2025-40106: comedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()

The comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation
`async->munge_chan %= async->cmd.chanlist_len` without first
checking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program submits a command with
chanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device
processes data in the interrupt handler path.

Add a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the
function, similar to the existing checks for !map and
CMDF_RAWDATA flag. When chanlist_len is zero, update
munge_count and return early, indicating the data was
handled without munging.

This prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user commands.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
