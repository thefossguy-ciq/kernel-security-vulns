Subject: CVE-2025-68350: exfat: fix divide-by-zero in exfat_allocate_bitmap

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix divide-by-zero in exfat_allocate_bitmap

The variable max_ra_count can be 0 in exfat_allocate_bitmap(),
which causes a divide-by-zero error in the subsequent modulo operation
(i % max_ra_count), leading to a system crash.
When max_ra_count is 0, it means that readahead is not used. This patch
load the bitmap without readahead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68350 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
