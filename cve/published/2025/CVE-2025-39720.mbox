Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix refcount leak causing resource not released

When ksmbd_conn_releasing(opinfo->conn) returns true,the refcount was not
decremented properly, causing a refcount leak that prevents the count from
reaching zero and the memory from being released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39720 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
