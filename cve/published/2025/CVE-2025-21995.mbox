Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sched: Fix fence reference count leak

The last_scheduled fence leaks when an entity is being killed and adding
the cleanup callback fails.

Decrement the reference count of prev when dma_fence_add_callback()
fails, ensuring proper balance.

[phasta: add git tag info for stable kernel]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
