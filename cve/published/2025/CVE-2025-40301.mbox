Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_event: validate skb length for unknown CC opcode

In hci_cmd_complete_evt(), if the command complete event has an unknown
opcode, we assume the first byte of the remaining skb->data contains the
return status. However, parameter data has previously been pulled in
hci_event_func(), which may leave the skb empty. If so, using skb->data[0]
for the return status uses un-init memory.

The fix is to check skb->len before using skb->data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40301 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
