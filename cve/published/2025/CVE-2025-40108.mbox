Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: qcom-geni: Fix blocked task

Revert commit 1afa70632c39 ("serial: qcom-geni: Enable PM runtime for
serial driver") and its dependent commit 86fa39dd6fb7 ("serial:
qcom-geni: Enable Serial on SA8255p Qualcomm platforms") because the
first one causes regression - hang task on Qualcomm RB1 board (QRB2210)
and unable to use serial at all during normal boot:

  INFO: task kworker/u16:0:12 blocked for more than 42 seconds.
        Not tainted 6.17.0-rc1-00004-g53e760d89498 #9
  "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

The issue was reported on 12th of August and was ignored by author of
commits introducing issue for two weeks.  Only after complaining author
produced a fix which did not work, so if original commits cannot be
reliably fixed for 5 weeks, they obviously are buggy and need to be
dropped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e810d81769e16637bcd845ba37fbc1eba5d4bd2
