Subject: CVE-2025-38098: drm/amd/display: Don't treat wb connector as physical in create_validate_stream_for_sink

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Don't treat wb connector as physical in create_validate_stream_for_sink

Don't try to operate on a drm_wb_connector as an amdgpu_dm_connector.
While dereferencing aconnector->base will "work" it's wrong and
might lead to unknown bad things. Just... don't.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38098 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
