Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()

When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to
return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that
leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid
array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported
actually when connected with a bad adapter.

Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner
cases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.

(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38254 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_helpers.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b63507d7cd243574753c6b91f68516d9103f1de
