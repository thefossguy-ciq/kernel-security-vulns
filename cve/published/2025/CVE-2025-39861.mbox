Subject: CVE-2025-39861: Bluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: vhci: Prevent use-after-free by removing debugfs files early

Move the creation of debugfs files into a dedicated function, and ensure
they are explicitly removed during vhci_release(), before associated
data structures are freed.

Previously, debugfs files such as "force_suspend", "force_wakeup", and
others were created under hdev->debugfs but not removed in
vhci_release(). Since vhci_release() frees the backing vhci_data
structure, any access to these files after release would result in
use-after-free errors.

Although hdev->debugfs is later freed in hci_release_dev(), user can
access files after vhci_data is freed but before hdev->debugfs is
released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39861 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
