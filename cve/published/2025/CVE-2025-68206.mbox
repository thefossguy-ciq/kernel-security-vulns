Subject: CVE-2025-68206: netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections

Sequence adjustment may be required for FTP traffic with PASV/EPSV modes.
due to need to re-write packet payload (IP, port) on the ftp control
connection. This can require changes to the TCP length and expected
seq / ack_seq.

The easiest way to reproduce this issue is with PASV mode.
Example ruleset:
table inet ftp_nat {
        ct helper ftp_helper {
                type "ftp" protocol tcp
                l3proto inet
        }

        chain prerouting {
                type filter hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 ct state new ct helper set "ftp_helper"
        }
}
table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
                type nat hook prerouting priority -100; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 dnat ip prefix to ip daddr map {
			192.168.100.1 : 192.168.13.2/32 }
        }

        chain postrouting {
                type nat hook postrouting priority 100 ; policy accept;
                tcp sport 21 snat ip prefix to ip saddr map {
			192.168.13.2 : 192.168.100.1/32 }
        }
}

Note that the ftp helper gets assigned *after* the dnat setup.

The inverse (nat after helper assign) is handled by an existing
check in nf_nat_setup_info() and will not show the problem.

Topoloy:

 +-------------------+     +----------------------------------+
 | FTP: 192.168.13.2 | <-> | NAT: 192.168.13.3, 192.168.100.1 |
 +-------------------+     +----------------------------------+
                                      |
                         +-----------------------+
                         | Client: 192.168.100.2 |
                         +-----------------------+

ftp nat changes do not work as expected in this case:
Connected to 192.168.100.1.
[..]
ftp> epsv
EPSV/EPRT on IPv4 off.
ftp> ls
227 Entering passive mode (192,168,100,1,209,129).
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection.

Kernel logs:

Fix this by adding the required extension when a conntrack helper is assigned
to a connection that has a nat binding.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68206 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
