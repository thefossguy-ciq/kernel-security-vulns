Subject: CVE-2025-37983: qibfs: fix _another_ leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

qibfs: fix _another_ leak

failure to allocate inode => leaked dentry...

this one had been there since the initial merge; to be fair,
if we are that far OOM, the odds of failing at that particular
allocation are low...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37983 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
