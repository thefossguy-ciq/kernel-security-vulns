Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()

The rtl8187_rx_cb() calculates the rx descriptor header address
by subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer.
However, it does not validate if the received packet
(skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough to contain this
header.

If a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer
underflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,
and causing a kernel panic.

Add length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers
before attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the
check fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68362 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
