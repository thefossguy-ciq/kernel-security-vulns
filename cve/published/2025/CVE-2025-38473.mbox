Subject: CVE-2025-38473: Bluetooth: Fix null-ptr-deref in l2cap_sock_resume_cb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix null-ptr-deref in l2cap_sock_resume_cb()

syzbot reported null-ptr-deref in l2cap_sock_resume_cb(). [0]

l2cap_sock_resume_cb() has a similar problem that was fixed by commit
1bff51ea59a9 ("Bluetooth: fix use-after-free error in lock_sock_nested()").

Since both l2cap_sock_kill() and l2cap_sock_resume_cb() are executed
under l2cap_sock_resume_cb(), we can avoid the issue simply by checking
if chan->data is NULL.

Let's not access to the killed socket in l2cap_sock_resume_cb().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
