Subject: CVE-2025-38002: io_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/fdinfo: grab ctx->uring_lock around io_uring_show_fdinfo()

Not everything requires locking in there, which is why the 'has_lock'
variable exists. But enough does that it's a bit unwieldy to manage.
Wrap the whole thing in a ->uring_lock trylock, and just return
with no output if we fail to grab it. The existing trylock() will
already have greatly diminished utility/output for the failure case.

This fixes an issue with reading the SQE fields, if the ring is being
actively resized at the same time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
