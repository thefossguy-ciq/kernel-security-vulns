Subject: CVE-2025-39816: io_uring/kbuf: always use READ_ONCE() to read ring provided buffer lengths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/kbuf: always use READ_ONCE() to read ring provided buffer lengths

Since the buffers are mapped from userspace, it is prudent to use
READ_ONCE() to read the value into a local variable, and use that for
any other actions taken. Having a stable read of the buffer length
avoids worrying about it changing after checking, or being read multiple
times.

Similarly, the buffer may well change in between it being picked and
being committed. Ensure the looping for incremental ring buffer commit
stops if it hits a zero sized buffer, as no further progress can be made
at that point.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39816 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
