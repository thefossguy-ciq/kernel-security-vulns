Subject: CVE-2025-71233: PCI: endpoint: Avoid creating sub-groups asynchronously

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: Avoid creating sub-groups asynchronously

The asynchronous creation of sub-groups by a delayed work could lead to a
NULL pointer dereference when the driver directory is removed before the
work completes.

The crash can be easily reproduced with the following commands:

  # cd /sys/kernel/config/pci_ep/functions/pci_epf_test
  # for i in {1..20}; do mkdir test && rmdir test; done

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000088
  ...
  Call Trace:
   configfs_register_group+0x3d/0x190
   pci_epf_cfs_work+0x41/0x110
   process_one_work+0x18f/0x350
   worker_thread+0x25a/0x3a0

Fix this issue by using configfs_add_default_group() API which does not
have the deadlock problem as configfs_register_group() and does not require
the delayed work handler.

[mani: slightly reworded the description and added stable list]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71233 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
