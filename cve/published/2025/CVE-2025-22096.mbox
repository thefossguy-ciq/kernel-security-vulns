Subject: CVE-2025-22096: drm/msm/gem: Fix error code msm_parse_deps()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/gem: Fix error code msm_parse_deps()

The SUBMIT_ERROR() macro turns the error code negative.  This extra '-'
operation turns it back to positive EINVAL again.  The error code is
passed to ERR_PTR() and since positive values are not an IS_ERR() it
eventually will lead to an oops.  Delete the '-'.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
