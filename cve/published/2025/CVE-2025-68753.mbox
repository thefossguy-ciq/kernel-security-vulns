Subject: CVE-2025-68753: ALSA: firewire-motu: add bounds check in put_user loop for DSP events

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: firewire-motu: add bounds check in put_user loop for DSP events

In the DSP event handling code, a put_user() loop copies event data.
When the user buffer size is not aligned to 4 bytes, it could overwrite
beyond the buffer boundary.

Fix by adding a bounds check before put_user().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68753 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
