Subject: CVE-2025-37874: net: ngbe: fix memory leak in ngbe_probe() error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ngbe: fix memory leak in ngbe_probe() error path

When ngbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated for wx->rss_key
in wx_init_rss_key(). However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent
error paths after ngbe_sw_init() don't free the rss_key. Fix that by
freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table.

Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init()
fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a double free for rss_key,
when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37874 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
