Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: light: opt3001: fix deadlock due to concurrent flag access

The threaded IRQ function in this driver is reading the flag twice: once to
lock a mutex and once to unlock it. Even though the code setting the flag
is designed to prevent it, there are subtle cases where the flag could be
true at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This
results in the mutex not being unlocked, resulting in a deadlock.

Fix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust, reading the
flag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37968 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c95c8f0959d0a72575eabf2ff888f47ed6d8b77
