Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

open_tree_attr: do not allow id-mapping changes without OPEN_TREE_CLONE

As described in commit 7a54947e727b ('Merge patch series "fs: allow
changing idmappings"'), open_tree_attr(2) was necessary in order to
allow for a detached mount to be created and have its idmappings changed
without the risk of any racing threads operating on it. For this reason,
mount_setattr(2) still does not allow for id-mappings to be changed.

However, there was a bug in commit 2462651ffa76 ("fs: allow changing
idmappings") which allowed users to bypass this restriction by calling
open_tree_attr(2) *without* OPEN_TREE_CLONE.

can_idmap_mount() prevented this bug from allowing an attached
mountpoint's id-mapping from being modified (thanks to an is_anon_ns()
check), but this still allows for detached (but visible) mounts to have
their be id-mapping changed. This risks the same UAF and locking issues
as described in the merge commit, and was likely unintentional.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39717 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69dbdc711d9130136824e3830191a6afffa0a1f0
