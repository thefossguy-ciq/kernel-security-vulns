Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: Revert "soundwire: qcom: Add set_channel_map api support"

This reverts commit 7796c97df6b1b2206681a07f3c80f6023a6593d5.

This patch broke Dragonboard 845c (sdm845). I see:

    Unexpected kernel BRK exception at EL1
    Internal error: BRK handler: 00000000f20003e8 [#1]  SMP

Dan has also reported following issues with the original patch
https://lore.kernel.org/all/33fe8fe7-719a-405a-9ed2-d9f816ce1d57@sabinyo.mountain/

Bug #1:
The zeroeth element of ctrl->pconfig[] is supposed to be unused.  We
start counting at 1.  However this code sets ctrl->pconfig[0].ch_mask = 128.

Bug #2:
There are SLIM_MAX_TX_PORTS (16) elements in tx_ch[] array but only
QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS + 1 (15) in the ctrl->pconfig[] array so it corrupts
memory like Yongqin Liu pointed out.

Bug 3:
Like Jie Gan pointed out, it erases all the tx information with the rx
information.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38486 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
