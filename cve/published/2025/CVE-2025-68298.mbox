Subject: CVE-2025-68298: Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Avoid btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() NULL deref

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Avoid btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() NULL deref

In btusb_mtk_setup(), we set `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` to:
  usb_ifnum_to_if(data->udev, MTK_ISO_IFNUM)

That function can return NULL in some cases. Even when it returns
NULL, though, we still go on to call btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf().

As of commit e9087e828827 ("Bluetooth: btusb: mediatek: Add locks for
usb_driver_claim_interface()"), calling btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf()
when `btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` is NULL will cause a crash because
we'll end up passing a bad pointer to device_lock(). Prior to that
commit we'd pass the NULL pointer directly to
usb_driver_claim_interface() which would detect it and return an
error, which was handled.

Resolve the crash in btusb_mtk_claim_iso_intf() by adding a NULL check
at the start of the function. This makes the code handle a NULL
`btmtk_data->isopkt_intf` the same way it did before the problematic
commit (just with a slight change to the error message printed).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68298 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
