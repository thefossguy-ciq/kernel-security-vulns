Subject: CVE-2025-38292: wifi: ath12k: fix invalid access to memory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix invalid access to memory

In ath12k_dp_rx_msdu_coalesce(), rxcb is fetched from skb and boolean
is_continuation is part of rxcb.
Currently, after freeing the skb, the rxcb->is_continuation accessed
again which is wrong since the memory is already freed.
This might lead use-after-free error.

Hence, fix by locally defining bool is_continuation from rxcb,
so that after freeing skb, is_continuation can be used.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38292 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
