Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7915: fix list corruption after hardware restart

Since stations are recreated from scratch, all lists that wcids are added
to must be cleared before calling ieee80211_restart_hw.
Set wcid->sta = 0 for each wcid entry in order to ensure that they are
not added again before they are ready.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39862 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
