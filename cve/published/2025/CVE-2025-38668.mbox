Subject: CVE-2025-38668: regulator: core: fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling data

Failing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled after freeing coupled_rdevs can
lead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed post-unbind.

This can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that rely
on coupling metadata.

For example, on ridesx4, unbinding the 'reg-dummy' platform device triggers
a panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.

Ensure n_coupled is set to 0 to prevent access to invalid pointers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38668 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
