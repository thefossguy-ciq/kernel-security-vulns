Subject: CVE-2025-22089: RDMA/core: Don't expose hw_counters outside of init net namespace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Don't expose hw_counters outside of init net namespace

Commit 467f432a521a ("RDMA/core: Split port and device counter sysfs
attributes") accidentally almost exposed hw counters to non-init net
namespaces. It didn't expose them fully, as an attempt to read any of
those counters leads to a crash like this one:

The problem can be reproduced using the following steps:
  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  cat /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters/*

The panic occurs because of casting the device pointer into an
ib_device pointer using container_of() in hw_stat_device_show() is
wrong and leads to a memory corruption.

However the real problem is that hw counters should never been exposed
outside of the non-init net namespace.

Fix this by saving the index of the corresponding attribute group
(it might be 1 or 2 depending on the presence of driver-specific
attributes) and zeroing the pointer to hw_counters group for compat
devices during the initialization.

With this fix applied hw_counters are not available in a non-init
net namespace:
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/1/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ports/2/hw_counters
    /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/hw_counters

  ip netns add foo
  ip netns exec foo bash
  find /sys/class/infiniband/mlx4_0/ -name hw_counters

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
