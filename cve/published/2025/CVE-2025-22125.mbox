Subject: CVE-2025-22125: md/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags

If blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performance
is quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,
due to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since
blk-wbt is introduced.

Other than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for
example REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority
reverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because
io will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.

Fix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22125 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
