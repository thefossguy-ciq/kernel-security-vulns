Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Fix invalid quirk input mapping

When an invalid value is passed via quirk option, currently
bytcr_rt5640 driver just ignores and leaves as is, which may lead to
unepxected results like OOB access.

This patch adds the sanity check and corrects the input mapping to the
certain default value if an invalid value is passed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40121 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
