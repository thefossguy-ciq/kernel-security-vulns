Subject: CVE-2025-68380: wifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment

In ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is sent to
firmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,
which goes against firmwire's definition.

While connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not
supported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff
is assigned to he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.

	Ext Tag: HE Capabilities
	    [...]
	    Supported HE-MCS and NSS Set
		[...]
	        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz
		    [...]
	            Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff

Swap the assignment to fix this issue.

As the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it
needs to go via he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping
done, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.

Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.1 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.41
Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68380 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
