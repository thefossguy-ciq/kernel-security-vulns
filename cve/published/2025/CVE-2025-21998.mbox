Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: fix efivars registration race

Since the conversion to using the TZ allocator, the efivars service is
registered before the memory pool has been allocated, something which
can lead to a NULL-pointer dereference in case of a racing EFI variable
access.

Make sure that all resources have been set up before registering the
efivars.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21998 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c4e37b381a7a243c298a4858fc0a5a74e737c79a
