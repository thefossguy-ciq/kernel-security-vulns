Subject: CVE-2025-39932: smb: client: let smbd_destroy() call disable_work_sync(&info->post_send_credits_work)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: let smbd_destroy() call disable_work_sync(&info->post_send_credits_work)

In smbd_destroy() we may destroy the memory so we better
wait until post_send_credits_work is no longer pending
and will never be started again.

I actually just hit the case using rxe:

It means rxe_post_recv was called after rdma_destroy_qp().
This happened because put_receive_buffer() was triggered
by ib_drain_qp() and called:
queue_work(info->workqueue, &info->post_send_credits_work);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39932 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ae90a2baf923e85eb037b636aa641250bf4220f
