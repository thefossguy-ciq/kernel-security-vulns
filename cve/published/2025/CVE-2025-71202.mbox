Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/sva: invalidate stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space

Introduce a new IOMMU interface to flush IOTLB paging cache entries for
the CPU kernel address space.  This interface is invoked from the x86
architecture code that manages combined user and kernel page tables,
specifically before any kernel page table page is freed and reused.

This addresses the main issue with vfree() which is a common occurrence
and can be triggered by unprivileged users.  While this resolves the
primary problem, it doesn't address some extremely rare case related to
memory unplug of memory that was present as reserved memory at boot, which
cannot be triggered by unprivileged users.  The discussion can be found at
the link below.

Enable SVA on x86 architecture since the IOMMU can now receive
notification to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page
table pages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71202 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.18.7 with commit 9f0a7ab700f8620e433b05c57fbd26c92ea186d9
	Fixed in 6.19 with commit e37d5a2d60a338c5917c45296bac65da1382eda5

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-71202
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/x86/Kconfig
	drivers/iommu/iommu-sva.c
	include/linux/iommu.h
	mm/pgtable-generic.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f0a7ab700f8620e433b05c57fbd26c92ea186d9
