Subject: CVE-2025-21976: fbdev: hyperv_fb: Allow graceful removal of framebuffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Allow graceful removal of framebuffer

When a Hyper-V framebuffer device is unbind, hyperv_fb driver tries to
release the framebuffer forcefully. If this framebuffer is in use it
produce the following WARN and hence this framebuffer is never released.

[   44.111220] WARNING: CPU: 35 PID: 1882 at drivers/video/fbdev/core/fb_info.c:70 framebuffer_release+0x2c/0x40

Fix this by moving the release of framebuffer and assosiated memory
to fb_ops.fb_destroy function, so that framebuffer framework handles
it gracefully.

While we fix this, also replace manual registrations/unregistration of
framebuffer with devm_register_framebuffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21976 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
