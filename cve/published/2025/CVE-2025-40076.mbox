Subject: CVE-2025-40076: PCI: rcar-host: Pass proper IRQ domain to generic_handle_domain_irq()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: rcar-host: Pass proper IRQ domain to generic_handle_domain_irq()

Starting with commit dd26c1a23fd5 ("PCI: rcar-host: Switch to
msi_create_parent_irq_domain()"), the MSI parent IRQ domain is NULL because
the object of type struct irq_domain_info passed to:

msi_create_parent_irq_domain() ->
  irq_domain_instantiate()() ->
    __irq_domain_instantiate()

has no reference to the parent IRQ domain. Using msi->domain->parent as an
argument for generic_handle_domain_irq() leads to below error:

	"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address"

This error was identified while switching the upcoming RZ/G3S PCIe host
controller driver to msi_create_parent_irq_domain() (which was using a
similar pattern to handle MSIs (see link section)), but it was not tested
on hardware using the pcie-rcar-host controller driver due to lack of
hardware.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e8e21aaf5d34015901cd271053a67a62b4204526
