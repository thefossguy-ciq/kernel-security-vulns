Subject: CVE-2025-39716: parisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read access

Because of the way read access support is implemented, read access
interruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The
kernel executes at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggers
a read access interruption (code 26). Thus, it is currently possible
for user code to access a read protected address via a system call.

Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER)
and setting __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn't allowed.

Note the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit compare because COND macro
doesn't work inside asm.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39716 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
