Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix recursive locking in RPC handle list access

Since commit 305853cce3794 ("ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list
access"), ksmbd_session_rpc_method() attempts to lock sess->rpc_lock.

This causes hung connections / tasks when a client attempts to open
a named pipe. Using Samba's rpcclient tool:

 $ rpcclient //192.168.1.254 -U user%password
 $ rpcclient $> srvinfo
 <connection hung here>

Kernel side:
  "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.
  task:kworker/0:0 state:D stack:0 pid:5021 tgid:5021 ppid:2 flags:0x00200000

  kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x38
  Exception stack(0x8529ffb0 to 0x8529fff8)

The task deadlocks because the lock is already held:
  ksmbd_session_rpc_open
    down_write(&sess->rpc_lock)
    ksmbd_rpc_open
      ksmbd_session_rpc_method
        down_read(&sess->rpc_lock)   <-- deadlock

Adjust ksmbd_session_rpc_method() callers to take the lock when necessary.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40090 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
