Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xtensa: simdisk: add input size check in proc_write_simdisk

A malicious user could pass an arbitrarily bad value
to memdup_user_nul(), potentially causing kernel crash.

This follows the same pattern as commit ee76746387f6
("netdevsim: prevent bad user input in nsim_dev_health_break_write()")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40193 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
