Subject: CVE-2025-21994: ksmbd: fix incorrect validation for num_aces field of smb_acl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix incorrect validation for num_aces field of smb_acl

parse_dcal() validate num_aces to allocate posix_ace_state_array.

if (num_aces > ULONG_MAX / sizeof(struct smb_ace *))

It is an incorrect validation that we can create an array of size ULONG_MAX.
smb_acl has ->size field to calculate actual number of aces in request buffer
size. Use this to check invalid num_aces.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
