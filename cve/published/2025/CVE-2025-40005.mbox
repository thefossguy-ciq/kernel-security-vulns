Subject: CVE-2025-40005: spi: cadence-quadspi: Implement refcount to handle unbind during busy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: cadence-quadspi: Implement refcount to handle unbind during busy

driver support indirect read and indirect write operation with
assumption no force device removal(unbind) operation. However
force device removal(removal) is still available to root superuser.

Unbinding driver during operation causes kernel crash. This changes
ensure driver able to handle such operation for indirect read and
indirect write by implementing refcount to track attached devices
to the controller and gracefully wait and until attached devices
remove operation completed before proceed with removal operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
