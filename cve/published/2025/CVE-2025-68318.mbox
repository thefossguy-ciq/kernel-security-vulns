Subject: CVE-2025-68318: clk: thead: th1520-ap: set all AXI clocks to CLK_IS_CRITICAL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: thead: th1520-ap: set all AXI clocks to CLK_IS_CRITICAL

The AXI crossbar of TH1520 has no proper timeout handling, which means
gating AXI clocks can easily lead to bus timeout and thus system hang.

Set all AXI clock gates to CLK_IS_CRITICAL. All these clock gates are
ungated by default on system reset.

In addition, convert all current CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED usage to
CLK_IS_CRITICAL to prevent unwanted clock gating.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68318 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
