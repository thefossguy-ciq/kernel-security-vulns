Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: move preempt_prepare_postamble after error check

Move the call to preempt_prepare_postamble() after verifying that
preempt_postamble_ptr is valid. If preempt_postamble_ptr is NULL,
dereferencing it in preempt_prepare_postamble() would lead to a crash.

This change avoids calling the preparation function when the
postamble allocation has failed, preventing potential NULL pointer
dereference and ensuring proper error handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71124 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a6xx_preempt.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c46497eb148ec61909f4101b8443f3c4c2daaec
