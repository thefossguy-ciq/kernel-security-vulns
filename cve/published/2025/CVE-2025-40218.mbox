Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/vaddr: do not repeat pte_offset_map_lock() until success

DAMON's virtual address space operation set implementation (vaddr) calls
pte_offset_map_lock() inside the page table walk callback function.  This
is for reading and writing page table accessed bits.  If
pte_offset_map_lock() fails, it retries by returning the page table walk
callback function with ACTION_AGAIN.

pte_offset_map_lock() can continuously fail if the target is a pmd
migration entry, though.  Hence it could cause an infinite page table walk
if the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished. 
This indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were
running in parallel.

Avoid the infinite loop by simply not retrying the page table walk.  DAMON
is promising only a best-effort accuracy, so missing access to such pages
is no problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40218 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
