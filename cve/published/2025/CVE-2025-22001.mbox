Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: Fix integer overflow in qaic_validate_req()

These are u64 variables that come from the user via
qaic_attach_slice_bo_ioctl().  Use check_add_overflow() to ensure that
the math doesn't have an integer wrapping bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
