Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/mm: Fix in_atomic() handling in do_secure_storage_access()

Kernel user spaces accesses to not exported pages in atomic context
incorrectly try to resolve the page fault.
With debug options enabled call traces like this can be seen:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1523

INFO: lockdep is turned off.

It is not allowed to take the mmap_lock while in atomic context. Therefore
handle such a secure storage access fault as if the accessed page is not
mapped: the uaccess function will return -EFAULT, and the caller has to
deal with this. Usually this means that the access is retried in process
context, which allows to resolve the page fault (or in this case export the
page).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38359 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.15.5 with commit d2e317dfd2d1fe416c77315d17c5d57dbe374915

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-38359
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/s390/mm/fault.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2e317dfd2d1fe416c77315d17c5d57dbe374915
