Subject: CVE-2025-37954: smb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks

A pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir might
race with a lease break, meaning open_cached_dir doesn't consider it
valid, and thinks it's newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference
if the allocation occurs before the queued lease break work runs.

Avoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across
find_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
