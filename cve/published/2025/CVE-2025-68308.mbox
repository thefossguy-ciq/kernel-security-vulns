Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers

The `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback`
functions contain logic to zero-length commands. These commands are used
to align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.

The driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer
position `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.

However, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary
(i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`
function will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`
to be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.

This patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.
This ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is
based on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next
aligned boundary.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68308 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
