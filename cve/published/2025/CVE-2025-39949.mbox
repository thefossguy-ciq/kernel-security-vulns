Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

qed: Don't collect too many protection override GRC elements

In the protection override dump path, the firmware can return far too
many GRC elements, resulting in attempting to write past the end of the
previously-kmalloc'ed dump buffer.

This will result in a kernel panic with reason:

 BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ADDRESS

where "ADDRESS" is just past the end of the protection override dump
buffer. The start address of the buffer is:
 p_hwfn->cdev->dbg_features[DBG_FEATURE_PROTECTION_OVERRIDE].dump_buf
and the size of the buffer is buf_size in the same data structure.

The panic can be arrived at from either the qede Ethernet driver path:

    [exception RIP: qed_grc_dump_addr_range+0x108]
 qed_protection_override_dump at ffffffffc02662ed [qed]
 qed_dbg_protection_override_dump at ffffffffc0267792 [qed]

 qed_report_fatal_error at ffffffffc0272baf [qed]
 qede_sp_task at ffffffffc045ed32 [qede]
 process_one_work at ffffffff81d19783

or the qedf storage driver path:

    [exception RIP: qed_grc_dump_addr_range+0x108]
 qed_protection_override_dump at ffffffffc068b2ed [qed]
 qed_dbg_protection_override_dump at ffffffffc068c792 [qed]

 fc_rport_work at ffffffffc02da715 [libfc]
 process_one_work at ffffffff8a319663

Resolve this by clamping the firmware's return value to the maximum
number of legal elements the firmware should return.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39949 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
