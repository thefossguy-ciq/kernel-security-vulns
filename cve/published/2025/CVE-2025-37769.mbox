Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm/smu11: Prevent division by zero

The user can set any speed value.
If speed is greater than UINT_MAX/8, division by zero is possible.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

(cherry picked from commit da7dc714a8f8e1c9fc33c57cd63583779a3bef71)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37769 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
