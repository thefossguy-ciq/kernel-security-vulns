Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix folio is still mapped when deleted

Migration may be raced with fallocating hole.  remove_inode_single_folio
will unmap the folio if the folio is still mapped.  However, it's called
without folio lock.  If the folio is migrated and the mapped pte has been
converted to migration entry, folio_mapped() returns false, and won't
unmap it.  Due to extra refcount held by remove_inode_single_folio,
migration fails, restores migration entry to normal pte, and the folio is
mapped again.  As a result, we triggered BUG in filemap_unaccount_folio.

The log is as follows:
 BUG: Bad page cache in process hugetlb  pfn:156c00

Hold folio lock before checking if the folio is mapped to avold race with
migration.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
