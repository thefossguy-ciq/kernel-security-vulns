Subject: CVE-2025-21982: pinctrl: nuvoton: npcm8xx: Add NULL check in npcm8xx_gpio_fw

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: nuvoton: npcm8xx: Add NULL check in npcm8xx_gpio_fw

devm_kasprintf() calls can return null pointers on failure.
But the return values were not checked in npcm8xx_gpio_fw().
Add NULL check in npcm8xx_gpio_fw(), to handle kernel NULL
pointer dereference error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
