Subject: CVE-2025-68313: x86/CPU/AMD: Add RDSEED fix for Zen5

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Add RDSEED fix for Zen5

There's an issue with RDSEED's 16-bit and 32-bit register output
variants on Zen5 which return a random value of 0 "at a rate inconsistent
with randomness while incorrectly signaling success (CF=1)". Search the
web for AMD-SB-7055 for more detail.

Add a fix glue which checks microcode revisions.

  [ bp: Add microcode revisions checking, rewrite. ]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
