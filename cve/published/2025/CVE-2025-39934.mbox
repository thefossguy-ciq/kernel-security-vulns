Subject: CVE-2025-39934: drm: bridge: anx7625: Fix NULL pointer dereference with early IRQ

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: bridge: anx7625: Fix NULL pointer dereference with early IRQ

If the interrupt occurs before resource initialization is complete, the
interrupt handler/worker may access uninitialized data such as the I2C
tcpc_client device, potentially leading to NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39934 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
