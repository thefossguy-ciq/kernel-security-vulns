Subject: CVE-2025-37860: sfc: fix NULL dereferences in ef100_process_design_param()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: fix NULL dereferences in ef100_process_design_param()

Since cited commit, ef100_probe_main() and hence also
 ef100_check_design_params() run before efx->net_dev is created;
 consequently, we cannot netif_set_tso_max_size() or _segs() at this
 point.
Move those netif calls to ef100_probe_netdev(), and also replace
 netif_err within the design params code with pci_err.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37860 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
