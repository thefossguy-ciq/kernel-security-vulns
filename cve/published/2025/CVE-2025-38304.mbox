Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix NULL pointer deference on eir_get_service_data

The len parameter is considered optional so it can be NULL so it cannot
be used for skipping to next entry of EIR_SERVICE_DATA.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38304 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
