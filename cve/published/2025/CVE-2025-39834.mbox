Subject: CVE-2025-39834: net/mlx5: HWS, Fix memory leak in hws_action_get_shared_stc_nic error flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: HWS, Fix memory leak in hws_action_get_shared_stc_nic error flow

When an invalid stc_type is provided, the function allocates memory for
shared_stc but jumps to unlock_and_out without freeing it, causing a
memory leak.

Fix by jumping to free_shared_stc label instead to ensure proper cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39834 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
