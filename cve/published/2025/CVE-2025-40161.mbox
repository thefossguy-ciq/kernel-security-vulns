Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix SGI cleanup on unbind

The driver incorrectly determines SGI vs SPI interrupts by checking IRQ
number < 16, which fails with dynamic IRQ allocation. During unbind,
this causes improper SGI cleanup leading to kernel crash.

Add explicit irq_type field to pdata for reliable identification of SGI
interrupts (type-2) and only clean up SGI resources when appropriate.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40161 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ee147efee68be00203b1fee6479911debb1edb2
