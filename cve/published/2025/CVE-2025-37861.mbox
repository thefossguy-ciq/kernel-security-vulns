Subject: CVE-2025-37861: scsi: mpi3mr: Synchronous access b/w reset and tm thread for reply queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Synchronous access b/w reset and tm thread for reply queue

When the task management thread processes reply queues while the reset
thread resets them, the task management thread accesses an invalid queue ID
(0xFFFF), set by the reset thread, which points to unallocated memory,
causing a crash.

Add flag 'io_admin_reset_sync' to synchronize access between the reset,
I/O, and admin threads. Before a reset, the reset handler sets this flag to
block I/O and admin processing threads. If any thread bypasses the initial
check, the reset thread waits up to 10 seconds for processing to finish. If
the wait exceeds 10 seconds, the controller is marked as unrecoverable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37861 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
