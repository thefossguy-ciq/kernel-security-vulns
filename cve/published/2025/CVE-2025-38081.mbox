In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi-rockchip: Fix register out of bounds access

Do not write native chip select stuff for GPIO chip selects.
GPIOs can be numbered much higher than native CS.
Also, it makes no sense.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
