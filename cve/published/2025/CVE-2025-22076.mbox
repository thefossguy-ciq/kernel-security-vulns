Subject: CVE-2025-22076: exfat: fix missing shutdown check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix missing shutdown check

xfstests generic/730 test failed because after deleting the device
that still had dirty data, the file could still be read without
returning an error. The reason is the missing shutdown check in
->read_iter.

I also noticed that shutdown checks were missing from ->write_iter,
->splice_read, and ->mmap. This commit adds shutdown checks to all
of them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22076 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
