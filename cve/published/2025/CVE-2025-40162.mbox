Subject: CVE-2025-40162: ASoC: amd/sdw_utils: avoid NULL deref when devm_kasprintf() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: amd/sdw_utils: avoid NULL deref when devm_kasprintf() fails

devm_kasprintf() may return NULL on memory allocation failure,
but the debug message prints cpus->dai_name before checking it.
Move the dev_dbg() call after the NULL check to prevent potential
NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40162 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
