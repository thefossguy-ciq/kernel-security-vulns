Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()

In statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset pointer (offp)
which is later updated with the string offset. However, the
STATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the
struct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,
leading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.

Fix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code
path consistent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68212 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/acfde9400e611c8d2668f1c70053c4a1d6ecfc36
