Subject: CVE-2025-38395: regulator: gpio: Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiods

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: gpio: Fix the out-of-bounds access to drvdata::gpiods

drvdata::gpiods is supposed to hold an array of 'gpio_desc' pointers. But
the memory is allocated for only one pointer. This will lead to
out-of-bounds access later in the code if 'config::ngpios' is > 1. So
fix the code to allocate enough memory to hold 'config::ngpios' of GPIO
descriptors.

While at it, also move the check for memory allocation failure to be below
the allocation to make it more readable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38395 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
