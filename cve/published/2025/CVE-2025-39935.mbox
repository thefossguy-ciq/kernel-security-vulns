Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codec: sma1307: Fix memory corruption in sma1307_setting_loaded()

The sma1307->set.header_size is how many integers are in the header
(there are 8 of them) but instead of allocating space of 8 integers
we allocate 8 bytes.  This leads to memory corruption when we copy data
it on the next line:

        memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data,
               sma1307->set.header_size * sizeof(int));

Also since we're immediately copying over the memory in ->set.header,
there is no need to zero it in the allocator.  Use devm_kmalloc_array()
to allocate the memory instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39935 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd59ca8f75dbb42a67fcae975c766114644e36c4
