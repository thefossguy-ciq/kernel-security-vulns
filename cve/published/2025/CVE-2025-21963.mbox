Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix integer overflow while processing acdirmax mount option

User-provided mount parameter acdirmax of type u32 is intended to have
an upper limit, but before it is validated, the value is converted from
seconds to jiffies which can lead to an integer overflow.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
