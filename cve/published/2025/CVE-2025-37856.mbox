Subject: CVE-2025-37856: btrfs: harden block_group::bg_list against list_del() races

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: harden block_group::bg_list against list_del() races

As far as I can tell, these calls of list_del_init() on bg_list cannot
run concurrently with btrfs_mark_bg_unused() or btrfs_mark_bg_to_reclaim(),
as they are in transaction error paths and situations where the block
group is readonly.

However, if there is any chance at all of racing with mark_bg_unused(),
or a different future user of bg_list, better to be safe than sorry.

Otherwise we risk the following interleaving (bg_list refcount in parens)

T1 (some random op)                       T2 (btrfs_mark_bg_unused)
                                        !list_empty(&bg->bg_list); (1)
list_del_init(&bg->bg_list); (1)
                                        list_move_tail (1)
btrfs_put_block_group (0)
                                        btrfs_delete_unused_bgs
                                             bg = list_first_entry
                                             list_del_init(&bg->bg_list);
                                             btrfs_put_block_group(bg); (-1)

Ultimately, this results in a broken ref count that hits zero one deref
early and the real final deref underflows the refcount, resulting in a WARNING.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37856 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
