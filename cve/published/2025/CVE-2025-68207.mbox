Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc: Synchronize Dead CT worker with unbind

Cancel and wait for any Dead CT worker to complete before continuing
with device unbinding. Else the worker will end up using resources freed
by the undind operation.

(cherry picked from commit 492671339114e376aaa38626d637a2751cdef263)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
