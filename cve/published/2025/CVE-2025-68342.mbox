Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing data

The URB received in gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback() contains a struct
gs_host_frame. The length of the data after the header depends on the
gs_host_frame hf::flags and the active device features (e.g. time
stamping).

Introduce a new function gs_usb_get_minimum_length() and check that we have
at least received the required amount of data before accessing it. Only
copy the data to that skb that has actually been received.

[mkl: rename gs_usb_get_minimum_length() -> +gs_usb_get_minimum_rx_length()]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68342 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
