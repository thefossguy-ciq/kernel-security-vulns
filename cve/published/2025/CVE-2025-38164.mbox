Subject: CVE-2025-38164: f2fs: zone: fix to avoid inconsistence in between SIT and SSA

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: zone: fix to avoid inconsistence in between SIT and SSA

w/ below testcase, it will cause inconsistence in between SIT and SSA.

create_null_blk 512 2 1024 1024
mkfs.f2fs -m /dev/nullb0
mount /dev/nullb0 /mnt/f2fs/
touch /mnt/f2fs/file
f2fs_io pinfile set /mnt/f2fs/file
fallocate -l 4GiB /mnt/f2fs/file

F2FS-fs (nullb0): Inconsistent segment (0) type [1, 0] in SSA and SIT

F2FS-fs (nullb0): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 4

The reason is f2fs_gc_range() may try to migrate block in curseg, however,
its SSA block is not uptodate due to the last summary block data is still
in cache of curseg.

In this patch, we add a condition in f2fs_gc_range() to check whether
section is opened or not, and skip block migration for opened section.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38164 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
