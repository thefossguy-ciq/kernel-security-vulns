Subject: CVE-2025-68373: md: avoid repeated calls to del_gendisk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: avoid repeated calls to del_gendisk

There is a uaf problem which is found by case 23rdev-lifetime:

Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122
RIP: 0010:bdi_unregister+0x4b/0x170
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 __del_gendisk+0x356/0x3e0
 mddev_unlock+0x351/0x360
 rdev_attr_store+0x217/0x280

 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f
RIP: 0033:0x7ff5250a177e

The sequence is:
1. rdev remove path gets reconfig_mutex
2. rdev remove path release reconfig_mutex in mddev_unlock
3. md stop calls do_md_stop and sets MD_DELETED
4. rdev remove path calls del_gendisk because MD_DELETED is set
5. md stop path release reconfig_mutex and calls del_gendisk again

So there is a race condition we should resolve. This patch adds a
flag MD_DO_DELETE to avoid the race condition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68373 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
