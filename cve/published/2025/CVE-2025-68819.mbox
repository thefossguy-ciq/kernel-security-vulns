Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-usb: dtv5100: fix out-of-bounds in dtv5100_i2c_msg()

rlen value is a user-controlled value, but dtv5100_i2c_msg() does not
check the size of the rlen value. Therefore, if it is set to a value
larger than sizeof(st->data), an out-of-bounds vuln occurs for st->data.

Therefore, we need to add proper range checking to prevent this vuln.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
