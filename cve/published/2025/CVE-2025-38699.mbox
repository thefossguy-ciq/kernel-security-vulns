Subject: CVE-2025-38699: scsi: bfa: Double-free fix

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: bfa: Double-free fix

When the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory
pointed to by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.

Subsequently, during driver uninstallation, when the state machine enters
the bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo() function,
it attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby
triggering a double-free vulnerability.

Set bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38699 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
