Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: add cluster chain loop check for dir

An infinite loop may occur if the following conditions occur due to
file system corruption.

(1) Condition for exfat_count_dir_entries() to loop infinitely.
    - The cluster chain includes a loop.
    - There is no UNUSED entry in the cluster chain.

(2) Condition for exfat_create_upcase_table() to loop infinitely.
    - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.
    - There are no UNUSED entry and up-case table entry in the cluster
      chain of the root directory.

(3) Condition for exfat_load_bitmap() to loop infinitely.
    - The cluster chain of the root directory includes a loop.
    - There are no UNUSED entry and bitmap entry in the cluster chain
      of the root directory.

(4) Condition for exfat_find_dir_entry() to loop infinitely.
    - The cluster chain includes a loop.
    - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.

(5) Condition for exfat_check_dir_empty() to loop infinitely.
    - The cluster chain includes a loop.
    - The unused directory entries were exhausted by some operation.
    - All files and sub-directories under the directory are deleted.

This commit adds checks to break the above infinite loop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38692 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
