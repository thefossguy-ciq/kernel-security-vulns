Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Fix refcount leak for cifs_sb_tlink

Fix three refcount inconsistency issues related to `cifs_sb_tlink`.

Comments for `cifs_sb_tlink` state that `cifs_put_tlink()` needs to be
called after successful calls to `cifs_sb_tlink()`. Three calls fail to
update refcount accordingly, leading to possible resource leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40103 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
