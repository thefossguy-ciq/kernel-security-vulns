Subject: CVE-2025-40307: exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap

syzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation
bitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without checking
this. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap
is 6, cluster 6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir.
exfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing
entries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,
the allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.
This patch adds exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for
the allocation bitmap are correctly marked as in-use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
