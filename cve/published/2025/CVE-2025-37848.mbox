Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix PM related deadlocks in MS IOCTLs

Prevent runtime resume/suspend while MS IOCTLs are in progress.
Failed suspend will call ivpu_ms_cleanup() that would try to acquire
file_priv->ms_lock, which is already held by the IOCTLs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
