Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: synaptics - fix crash when enabling pass-through port

When enabling a pass-through port an interrupt might come before psmouse
driver binds to the pass-through port. However synaptics sub-driver
tries to access psmouse instance presumably associated with the
pass-through port to figure out if only 1 byte of response or entire
protocol packet needs to be forwarded to the pass-through port and may
crash if psmouse instance has not been attached to the port yet.

Fix the crash by introducing open() and close() methods for the port and
check if the port is open before trying to access psmouse instance.
Because psmouse calls serio_open() only after attaching psmouse instance
to serio port instance this prevents the potential crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21746 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.c
	drivers/input/mouse/synaptics.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87da1ea93ec9f9f0004e5b12e78789bc94e360bf
