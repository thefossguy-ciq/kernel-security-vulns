Subject: CVE-2025-39740: drm/xe/migrate: prevent potential UAF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/migrate: prevent potential UAF

If we hit the error path, the previous fence (if there is one) has
already been put() prior to this, so doing a fence_wait could lead to
UAF. Tweak the flow to do to the put() until after we do the wait.

(cherry picked from commit 9b7ca35ed28fe5fad86e9d9c24ebd1271e4c9c3e)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39740 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
