Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-pf: QOS: Refactor TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callback

This patch addresses below issues,

1. Active traffic on the leaf node must be stopped before its send queue
   is reassigned to the parent. This patch resolves the issue by marking
   the node as 'Inner'.

2. During a system reboot, the interface receives TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL
   and TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callbacks to delete its HTB queues.
   In the case of TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST, although the same send queue
   is reassigned to the parent, the current logic still attempts to update
   the real number of queues, leadning to below warnings

        New queues can't be registered after device unregistration.
        WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 6475 at net/core/net-sysfs.c:1714

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38278 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
