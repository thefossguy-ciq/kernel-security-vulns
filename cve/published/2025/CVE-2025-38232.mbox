Subject: CVE-2025-38232: NFSD: fix race between nfsd registration and exports_proc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix race between nfsd registration and exports_proc

As of now nfsd calls create_proc_exports_entry() at start of init_nfsd
and cleanup by remove_proc_entry() at last of exit_nfsd.

Which causes kernel OOPs if there is race between below 2 operations:
(i) exportfs -r
(ii) mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd

for 5.4 kernel ARM64:

CPU 1:
el1_irq+0xbc/0x180
arch_counter_get_cntvct+0x14/0x18
running_clock+0xc/0x18

nfsd_init_net+0x6c/0x108 [nfsd]
ops_init+0x44/0x170
register_pernet_operations+0x114/0x270
register_pernet_subsys+0x34/0x50
init_nfsd+0xa8/0x718 [nfsd]
do_one_initcall+0x54/0x2e0

CPU 2 :
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010

PC is at : exports_net_open+0x50/0x68 [nfsd]

Call trace:
exports_net_open+0x50/0x68 [nfsd]
exports_proc_open+0x2c/0x38 [nfsd]
proc_reg_open+0xb8/0x198
do_dentry_open+0x1c4/0x418
vfs_open+0x38/0x48
path_openat+0x28c/0xf18
do_filp_open+0x70/0xe8
do_sys_open+0x154/0x248

Sometimes it crashes at exports_net_open() and sometimes cache_seq_next_rcu().

and same is happening on latest 6.14 kernel as well:

[  285.473422] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

It reproduced simply with below script:
while [ 1 ]
do
/exportfs -r
done &

while [ 1 ]
do
insmod /nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd
done &

So exporting interfaces to user space shall be done at last and
cleanup at first place.

With change there is no Kernel OOPs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38232 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
