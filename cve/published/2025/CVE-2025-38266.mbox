Subject: CVE-2025-38266: pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Commit 3ef9f710efcb ("pinctrl: mediatek: Add EINT support for multiple
addresses") introduced an access to the 'soc' field of struct
mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of
pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.

However, pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include
pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which provides another definition of
struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an 'soc' field.

Since mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it
will now try to dereference an invalid pointer when called on v1
platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which
crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with
earlycon).

In order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get
a 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter
of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing
mtk_eint_do_init()'s dependency on any particular 'struct mtk_pinctrl'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38266 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
