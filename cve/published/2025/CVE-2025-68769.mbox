Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix return value of f2fs_recover_fsync_data()

With below scripts, it will trigger panic in f2fs:

mkfs.f2fs -f /dev/vdd
mount /dev/vdd /mnt/f2fs
touch /mnt/f2fs/foo
sync
echo 111 >> /mnt/f2fs/foo
f2fs_io fsync /mnt/f2fs/foo
f2fs_io shutdown 2 /mnt/f2fs
umount /mnt/f2fs
mount -o ro,norecovery /dev/vdd /mnt/f2fs
or
mount -o ro,disable_roll_forward /dev/vdd /mnt/f2fs

F2FS-fs (vdd): f2fs_recover_fsync_data: recovery fsync data, check_only: 0
F2FS-fs (vdd): Mounted with checkpoint version = 7f5c361f
F2FS-fs (vdd): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 0
F2FS-fs (vdd): f2fs_recover_fsync_data: recovery fsync data, check_only: 1
Filesystem f2fs get_tree() didn't set fc->root, returned 1

kernel BUG at fs/super.c:1761!
Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI

Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.3-debian-1.16.3-2 04/01/2014

The root cause is we missed to handle error number returned from
f2fs_recover_fsync_data() when mounting image w/ ro,norecovery or
ro,disable_roll_forward mount option, result in returning a positive
error number to vfs_get_tree(), fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68769 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
