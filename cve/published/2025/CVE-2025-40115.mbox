Subject: CVE-2025-40115: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix crash in transport port remove by using ioc_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix crash in transport port remove by using ioc_info()

During mpt3sas_transport_port_remove(), messages were logged with
dev_printk() against &mpt3sas_port->port->dev. At this point the SAS
transport device may already be partially unregistered or freed, leading
to a crash when accessing its struct device.

Using ioc_info(), which logs via the PCI device (ioc->pdev->dev),
guaranteed to remain valid until driver removal.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
