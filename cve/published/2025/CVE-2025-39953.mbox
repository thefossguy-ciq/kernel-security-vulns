Subject: CVE-2025-39953: cgroup: split cgroup_destroy_wq into 3 workqueues

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup: split cgroup_destroy_wq into 3 workqueues

A hung task can occur during [1] LTP cgroup testing when repeatedly
mounting/unmounting perf_event and net_prio controllers with
systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1. The hang manifests in
cgroup_lock_and_drain_offline() during root destruction.

Related case:
cgroup_fj_function_perf_event cgroup_fj_function.sh perf_event
cgroup_fj_function_net_prio cgroup_fj_function.sh net_prio

Call Trace:
	cgroup_lock_and_drain_offline+0x14c/0x1e8
	cgroup_destroy_root+0x3c/0x2c0
	css_free_rwork_fn+0x248/0x338
	process_one_work+0x16c/0x3b8
	worker_thread+0x22c/0x3b0
	kthread+0xec/0x100
	ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

Root Cause:

CPU0                            CPU1
mount perf_event                umount net_prio
cgroup1_get_tree                cgroup_kill_sb
rebind_subsystems               // root destruction enqueues
				// cgroup_destroy_wq
// kill all perf_event css
                                // one perf_event css A is dying
                                // css A offline enqueues cgroup_destroy_wq
                                // root destruction will be executed first
                                css_free_rwork_fn
                                cgroup_destroy_root
                                cgroup_lock_and_drain_offline
                                // some perf descendants are dying
                                // cgroup_destroy_wq max_active = 1
                                // waiting for css A to die

Problem scenario:
1. CPU0 mounts perf_event (rebind_subsystems)
2. CPU1 unmounts net_prio (cgroup_kill_sb), queuing root destruction work
3. A dying perf_event CSS gets queued for offline after root destruction
4. Root destruction waits for offline completion, but offline work is
   blocked behind root destruction in cgroup_destroy_wq (max_active=1)

Solution:
Split cgroup_destroy_wq into three dedicated workqueues:
cgroup_offline_wq – Handles CSS offline operations
cgroup_release_wq – Manages resource release
cgroup_free_wq – Performs final memory deallocation

This separation eliminates blocking in the CSS free path while waiting for
offline operations to complete.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
