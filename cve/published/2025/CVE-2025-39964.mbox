Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: af_alg - Disallow concurrent writes in af_alg_sendmsg

Issuing two writes to the same af_alg socket is bogus as the
data will be interleaved in an unpredictable fashion.  Furthermore,
concurrent writes may create inconsistencies in the internal
socket state.

Disallow this by adding a new ctx->write field that indiciates
exclusive ownership for writing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39964 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
