Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: clip: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in to_atmarpd().

atmarpd is protected by RTNL since commit f3a0592b37b8 ("[ATM]: clip
causes unregister hang").

However, it is not enough because to_atmarpd() is called without RTNL,
especially clip_neigh_solicit() / neigh_ops->solicit() is unsleepable.

Also, there is no RTNL dependency around atmarpd.

Let's use a private mutex and RCU to protect access to atmarpd in
to_atmarpd().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38460 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
