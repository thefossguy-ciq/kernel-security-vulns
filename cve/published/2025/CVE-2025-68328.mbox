Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: stratix10-svc: fix bug in saving controller data

Fix the incorrect usage of platform_set_drvdata and dev_set_drvdata. They
both are of the same data and overrides each other. This resulted in the
rmmod of the svc driver to fail and throw a kernel panic for kthread_stop
and fifo free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68328 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
