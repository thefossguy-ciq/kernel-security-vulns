Subject: CVE-2025-38410: drm/msm: Fix a fence leak in submit error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Fix a fence leak in submit error path

In error paths, we could unref the submit without calling
drm_sched_entity_push_job(), so msm_job_free() will never get
called.  Since drm_sched_job_cleanup() will NULL out the
s_fence, we can use that to detect this case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38410 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
