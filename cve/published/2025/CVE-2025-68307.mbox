Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_xmit_callback(): fix handling of failed transmitted URBs

The driver lacks the cleanup of failed transfers of URBs. This reduces the
number of available URBs per error by 1. This leads to reduced performance
and ultimately to a complete stop of the transmission.

If the sending of a bulk URB fails do proper cleanup:
- increase netdev stats
- mark the echo_sbk as free
- free the driver's context and do accounting
- wake the send queue

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
