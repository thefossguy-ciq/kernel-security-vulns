Subject: CVE-2025-38381: Input: cs40l50-vibra - fix potential NULL dereference in cs40l50_upload_owt()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: cs40l50-vibra - fix potential NULL dereference in cs40l50_upload_owt()

The cs40l50_upload_owt() function allocates memory via kmalloc()
without checking for allocation failure, which could lead to a
NULL pointer dereference.

Return -ENOMEM in case allocation fails.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
