Subject: CVE-2025-38653: proc: use the same treatment to check proc_lseek as ones for proc_read_iter et.al

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

proc: use the same treatment to check proc_lseek as ones for proc_read_iter et.al

Check pde->proc_ops->proc_lseek directly may cause UAF in rmmod scenario. 
It's a gap in proc_reg_open() after commit 654b33ada4ab("proc: fix UAF in
proc_get_inode()").  Followed by AI Viro's suggestion, fix it in same
manner.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38653 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
