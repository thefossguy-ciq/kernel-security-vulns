Subject: CVE-2025-23139: Bluetooth: hci_uart: Fix another race during initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_uart: Fix another race during initialization

Do not set 'HCI_UART_PROTO_READY' before call 'hci_uart_register_dev()'.
Possible race is when someone calls 'hci_tty_uart_close()' after this bit
is set, but 'hci_uart_register_dev()' wasn't done. This leads to access
to uninitialized fields. To fix it let's set this bit after device was
registered (as before patch c411c62cc133) and to fix previous problem let's
add one more bit in addition to 'HCI_UART_PROTO_READY' which allows to
perform power up without original bit set (pls see commit c411c62cc133).

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c
	drivers/bluetooth/hci_uart.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
