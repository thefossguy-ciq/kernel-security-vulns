Subject: CVE-2025-39795: block: avoid possible overflow for chunk_sectors check in blk_stack_limits()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: avoid possible overflow for chunk_sectors check in blk_stack_limits()

In blk_stack_limits(), we check that the t->chunk_sectors value is a
multiple of the t->physical_block_size value.

However, by finding the chunk_sectors value in bytes, we may overflow
the unsigned int which holds chunk_sectors, so change the check to be
based on sectors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39795 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
