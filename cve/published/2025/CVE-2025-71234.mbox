Subject: CVE-2025-71234: wifi: rtl8xxxu: fix slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl8xxxu: fix slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add

The driver does not set hw->sta_data_size, which causes mac80211 to
allocate insufficient space for driver private station data in
__sta_info_alloc(). When rtl8xxxu_sta_add() accesses members of
struct rtl8xxxu_sta_info through sta->drv_priv, this results in a
slab-out-of-bounds write.

KASAN report on RISC-V (VisionFive 2) with RTL8192EU adapter:

  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in rtl8xxxu_sta_add+0x31c/0x346
  Write of size 8 at addr ffffffd6d3e9ae88 by task kworker/u16:0/12

Set hw->sta_data_size to sizeof(struct rtl8xxxu_sta_info) during
probe, similar to how hw->vif_data_size is configured. This ensures
mac80211 allocates sufficient space for the driver's per-station
private data.

Tested on StarFive VisionFive 2 v1.2A board.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
