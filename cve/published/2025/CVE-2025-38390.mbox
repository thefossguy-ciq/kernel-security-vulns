Subject: CVE-2025-38390: firmware: arm_ffa: Fix memory leak by freeing notifier callback node

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_ffa: Fix memory leak by freeing notifier callback node

Commit e0573444edbf ("firmware: arm_ffa: Add interfaces to request
notification callbacks") adds support for notifier callbacks by allocating
and inserting a callback node into a hashtable during registration of
notifiers. However, during unregistration, the code only removes the
node from the hashtable without freeing the associated memory, resulting
in a memory leak.

Resolve the memory leak issue by ensuring the allocated notifier callback
node is properly freed after it is removed from the hashtable entry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38390 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
