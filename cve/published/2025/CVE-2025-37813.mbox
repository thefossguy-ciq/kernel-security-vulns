Subject: CVE-2025-37813: usb: xhci: Fix invalid pointer dereference in Etron workaround

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Fix invalid pointer dereference in Etron workaround

This check is performed before prepare_transfer() and prepare_ring(), so
enqueue can already point at the final link TRB of a segment. And indeed
it will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.

Then enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer. It will crash the kernel right
away or load some junk which may look like a link TRB and cause the real
link TRB to be replaced with a NOOP. This wouldn't end well.

Use a functionally equivalent test which doesn't dereference the pointer
and always gives correct result.

Something has crashed my machine twice in recent days while playing with
an Etron HC, and a control transfer stress test ran for confirmation has
just crashed it again. The same test passes with this patch applied.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37813 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
