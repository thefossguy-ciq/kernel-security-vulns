Subject: CVE-2025-38680: media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Fix 1-byte out-of-bounds read in uvc_parse_format()

The buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured
that the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen > 2), buf the function
accesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.

Fix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in
uvc_parse_format().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38680 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
