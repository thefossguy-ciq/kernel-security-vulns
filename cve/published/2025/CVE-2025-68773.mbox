Subject: CVE-2025-68773: spi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode

Commit fc96ec826bce ("spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers
with even size") failed to make sure that the size is really even
before switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went
unnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size
PAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.

But commit 8ad6249c51d0 ("eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem API")
introduced an additional dynamically allocated bounce buffer whose size
is exactly the size of the transfer, leading to a buffer overrun in
the fsl-cpm driver when that size is odd.

Add the missing length parity verification and remain in 8 bit mode
when the length is not even.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
