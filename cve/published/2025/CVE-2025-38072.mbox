Subject: CVE-2025-38072: libnvdimm/labels: Fix divide error in nd_label_data_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libnvdimm/labels: Fix divide error in nd_label_data_init()

If a faulty CXL memory device returns a broken zero LSA size in its
memory device information (Identify Memory Device (Opcode 4000h), CXL
spec. 3.1, 8.2.9.9.1.1), a divide error occurs in the libnvdimm
driver:

 Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI
 RIP: 0010:nd_label_data_init+0x10e/0x800 [libnvdimm]

Code and flow:

1) CXL Command 4000h returns LSA size = 0
2) config_size is assigned to zero LSA size (CXL pmem driver):

drivers/cxl/pmem.c:             .config_size = mds->lsa_size,

3) max_xfer is set to zero (nvdimm driver):

drivers/nvdimm/label.c: max_xfer = min_t(size_t, ndd->nsarea.max_xfer, config_size);

4) A subsequent DIV_ROUND_UP() causes a division by zero:

drivers/nvdimm/label.c: /* Make our initial read size a multiple of max_xfer size */
drivers/nvdimm/label.c: read_size = min(DIV_ROUND_UP(read_size, max_xfer) * max_xfer,
drivers/nvdimm/label.c-                 config_size);

Fix this by checking the config size parameter by extending an
existing check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38072 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
