Subject: CVE-2025-40132: ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Prevent jump to NULL add_sidecar callback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Prevent jump to NULL add_sidecar callback

In create_sdw_dailink() check that sof_end->codec_info->add_sidecar
is not NULL before calling it.

The original code assumed that if include_sidecar is true, the codec
on that link has an add_sidecar callback. But there could be other
codecs on the same link that do not have an add_sidecar callback.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
