Subject: CVE-2025-38484: iio: backend: fix out-of-bound write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: backend: fix out-of-bound write

The buffer is set to 80 character. If a caller write more characters,
count is truncated to the max available space in "simple_write_to_buffer".
But afterwards a string terminator is written to the buffer at offset count
without boundary check. The zero termination is written OUT-OF-BOUND.

Add a check that the given buffer is smaller then the buffer to prevent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38484 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
