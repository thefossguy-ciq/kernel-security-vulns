Subject: CVE-2025-39819: fs/smb: Fix inconsistent refcnt update

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/smb: Fix inconsistent refcnt update

A possible inconsistent update of refcount was identified in `smb2_compound_op`.
Such inconsistent update could lead to possible resource leaks.

Why it is a possible bug:
1. In the comment section of the function, it clearly states that the
reference to `cfile` should be dropped after calling this function.
2. Every control flow path would check and drop the reference to
`cfile`, except the patched one.
3. Existing callers would not handle refcount update of `cfile` if
-ENOMEM is returned.

To fix the bug, an extra goto label "out" is added, to make sure that the
cleanup logic would always be respected. As the problem is caused by the
allocation failure of `vars`, the cleanup logic between label "finished"
and "out" can be safely ignored. According to the definition of function
`is_replayable_error`, the error code of "-ENOMEM" is not recoverable.
Therefore, the replay logic also gets ignored.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
