Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix incorrect io_kiocb reference in io_link_skb

In io_link_skb function, there is a bug where prev_notif is incorrectly
assigned using 'nd' instead of 'prev_nd'. This causes the context
validation check to compare the current notification with itself instead
of comparing it with the previous notification.

Fix by using the correct prev_nd parameter when obtaining prev_notif.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39963 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
