Subject: CVE-2025-40129: sunrpc: fix null pointer dereference on zero-length checksum

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: fix null pointer dereference on zero-length checksum

In xdr_stream_decode_opaque_auth(), zero-length checksum.len causes
checksum.data to be set to NULL. This triggers a NPD when accessing
checksum.data in gss_krb5_verify_mic_v2(). This patch ensures that
the value of checksum.len is not less than XDR_UNIT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
