Subject: CVE-2025-71095: net: stmmac: fix the crash issue for zero copy XDP_TX action

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: fix the crash issue for zero copy XDP_TX action

There is a crash issue when running zero copy XDP_TX action, the crash
log is shown below.

[  216.122464] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffeffff80000000
[  216.187524] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000144 [#1]  SMP

For XDP_TX action, the xdp_buff is converted to xdp_frame by
xdp_convert_buff_to_frame(). The memory type of the resulting xdp_frame
depends on the memory type of the xdp_buff. For page pool based xdp_buff
it produces xdp_frame with memory type MEM_TYPE_PAGE_POOL. For zero copy
XSK pool based xdp_buff it produces xdp_frame with memory type
MEM_TYPE_PAGE_ORDER0. However, stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() does not check the
memory type and always uses the page pool type, this leads to invalid
mappings and causes the crash. Therefore, check the xdp_buff memory type
in stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71095 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
