Subject: CVE-2025-71073: Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device

lkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(), and the work
handler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its
serio/input_dev fields.

lkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd
structure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again
until serio_close() returns. This can allow the work handler to run
after the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.

Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the
reinit work cannot be re-queued, and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect()
and in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71073 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
