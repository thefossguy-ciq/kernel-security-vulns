Subject: CVE-2025-68370: coresight: tmc: add the handle of the event to the path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: tmc: add the handle of the event to the path

The handle is essential for retrieving the AUX_EVENT of each CPU and is
required in perf mode. It has been added to the coresight_path so that
dependent devices can access it from the path when needed.

The existing bug can be reproduced with:
perf record -e cs_etm//k -C 0-9 dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null

Showing an oops as follows:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000f6e84934ed19e

Call trace:
 tmc_etr_get_buffer+0x30/0x80 [coresight_tmc] (P)
 catu_enable_hw+0xbc/0x3d0 [coresight_catu]
 catu_enable+0x70/0xe0 [coresight_catu]
 coresight_enable_path+0xb0/0x258 [coresight]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68370 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
