Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix potential UAF in smb2_close_cached_fid()

find_or_create_cached_dir() could grab a new reference after kref_put()
had seen the refcount drop to zero but before cfid_list_lock is acquired
in smb2_close_cached_fid(), leading to use-after-free.

Switch to kref_put_lock() so cfid_release() is called with
cfid_list_lock held, closing that gap.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40328 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
