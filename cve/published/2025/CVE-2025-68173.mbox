Subject: CVE-2025-68173: ftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable

A soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module.
If a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls
to kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical
section and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.
This is the same issue that was fixed in
commit d0b24b4e91fc ("ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY
kernels") and commit 42ea22e754ba ("ftrace: Add cond_resched() to
ftrace_graph_set_hash()").

Fix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in ftrace_module_enable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68173 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
