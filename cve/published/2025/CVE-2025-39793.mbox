Subject: CVE-2025-39793: io_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/memmap: cast nr_pages to size_t before shifting

If the allocated size exceeds UINT_MAX, then it's necessary to cast
the mr->nr_pages value to size_t to prevent it from overflowing. In
practice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will
have been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes
will be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly
exceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to
mb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and
then it's possible to hit this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39793 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
