Subject: CVE-2025-40127: hwrng: ks-sa - fix division by zero in ks_sa_rng_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwrng: ks-sa - fix division by zero in ks_sa_rng_init

Fix division by zero in ks_sa_rng_init caused by missing clock
pointer initialization. The clk_get_rate() call is performed on
an uninitialized clk pointer, resulting in division by zero when
calculating delay values.

Add clock initialization code before using the clock.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
