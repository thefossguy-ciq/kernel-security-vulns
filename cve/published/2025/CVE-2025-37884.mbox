Subject: CVE-2025-37884: bpf: Fix deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex.

Fix the following deadlock:
CPU A
_free_event()
  perf_kprobe_destroy()
    mutex_lock(&event_mutex)
      perf_trace_event_unreg()
        synchronize_rcu_tasks_trace()

There are several paths where _free_event() grabs event_mutex
and calls sync_rcu_tasks_trace. Above is one such case.

CPU B
bpf_prog_test_run_syscall()
  rcu_read_lock_trace()
    bpf_prog_run_pin_on_cpu()
      bpf_prog_load()
        bpf_tracing_func_proto()
          trace_set_clr_event()
            mutex_lock(&event_mutex)

Delegate trace_set_clr_event() to workqueue to avoid
such lock dependency.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37884 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
