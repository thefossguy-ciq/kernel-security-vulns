Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: use RCU in ip6_output()

Use RCU in ip6_output() in order to use dst_dev_rcu() to prevent
possible UAF.

We can remove rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pairs
from ip6_finish_output2().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0393f85c3241c19ba8550f04a812e7d19f6b3082
