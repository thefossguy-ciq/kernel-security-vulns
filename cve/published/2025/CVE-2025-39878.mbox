Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix crash after fscrypt_encrypt_pagecache_blocks() error

The function move_dirty_folio_in_page_array() was created by commit
ce80b76dd327 ("ceph: introduce ceph_process_folio_batch() method") by
moving code from ceph_writepages_start() to this function.

This new function is supposed to return an error code which is checked
by the caller (now ceph_process_folio_batch()), and on error, the
caller invokes redirty_page_for_writepage() and then breaks from the
loop.

However, the refactoring commit has gone wrong, and it by accident, it
always returns 0 (= success) because it first NULLs the pointer and
then returns PTR_ERR(NULL) which is always 0.  This means errors are
silently ignored, leaving NULL entries in the page array, which may
later crash the kernel.

The simple solution is to call PTR_ERR() before clearing the pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39878 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/ceph/addr.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd1616ecbea920d228c56729461ed223cc501425
