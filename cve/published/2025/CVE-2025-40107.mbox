Subject: CVE-2025-40107: can: hi311x: fix null pointer dereference when resuming from sleep before interface was enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: hi311x: fix null pointer dereference when resuming from sleep before interface was enabled

This issue is similar to the vulnerability in the `mcp251x` driver,
which was fixed in commit 03c427147b2d ("can: mcp251x: fix resume from
sleep before interface was brought up").

In the `hi311x` driver, when the device resumes from sleep, the driver
schedules `priv->restart_work`. However, if the network interface was
not previously enabled, the `priv->wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and
initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.

To fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue
from the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.
This ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is
used during device resume. And added logic to destroy the workqueue
in the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the
`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40107 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
