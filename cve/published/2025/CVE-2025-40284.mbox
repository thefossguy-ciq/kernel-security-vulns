Subject: CVE-2025-40284: Bluetooth: MGMT: cancel mesh send timer when hdev removed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: MGMT: cancel mesh send timer when hdev removed

mesh_send_done timer is not canceled when hdev is removed, which causes

(in "Mesh - Send cancel - 1" test).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
