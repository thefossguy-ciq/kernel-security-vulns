Subject: CVE-2025-40045: ASoC: codecs: wcd937x: set the comp soundwire port correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd937x: set the comp soundwire port correctly

For some reason we endup with setting soundwire port for
HPHL_COMP and HPHR_COMP as zero, this can potentially result
in a memory corruption due to accessing and setting -1 th element of
port_map array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
