Subject: CVE-2025-38531: iio: common: st_sensors: Fix use of uninitialize device structs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: common: st_sensors: Fix use of uninitialize device structs

Throughout the various probe functions &indio_dev->dev is used before it
is initialized. This caused a kernel panic in st_sensors_power_enable()
when the call to devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable() fails and then calls
dev_err_probe() with the uninitialized device.

This seems to only cause a panic with dev_err_probe(), dev_err(),
dev_warn() and dev_info() don't seem to cause a panic, but are fixed
as well.

The issue is reported and traced here: [1]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38531 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
