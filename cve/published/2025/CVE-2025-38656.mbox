Subject: CVE-2025-38656: wifi: iwlwifi: Fix error code in iwl_op_mode_dvm_start()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: Fix error code in iwl_op_mode_dvm_start()

Preserve the error code if iwl_setup_deferred_work() fails.  The current
code returns ERR_PTR(0) (which is NULL) on this path.  I believe the
missing error code potentially leads to a use after free involving
debugfs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38656 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
