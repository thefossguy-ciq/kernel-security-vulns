Subject: CVE-2025-40175: idpf: cleanup remaining SKBs in PTP flows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: cleanup remaining SKBs in PTP flows

When the driver requests Tx timestamp value, one of the first steps is
to clone SKB using skb_get. It increases the reference counter for that
SKB to prevent unexpected freeing by another component.
However, there may be a case where the index is requested, SKB is
assigned and never consumed by PTP flows - for example due to reset during
running PTP apps.

Add a check in release timestamping function to verify if the SKB
assigned to Tx timestamp latch was freed, and release remaining SKBs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
