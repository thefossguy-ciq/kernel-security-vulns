Subject: CVE-2025-38712: hfsplus: don't use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: don't use BUG_ON() in hfsplus_create_attributes_file()

When the volume header contains erroneous values that do not reflect
the actual state of the filesystem, hfsplus_fill_super() assumes that
the attributes file is not yet created, which later results in hitting
BUG_ON() when hfsplus_create_attributes_file() is called. Replace this
BUG_ON() with -EIO error with a message to suggest running fsck tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38712 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
