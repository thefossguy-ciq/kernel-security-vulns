Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs

If the user tries to write more than 32 bytes then it results in memory
corruption.  Fortunately, this is debugfs so it's limited to root users.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38317 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
