Subject: CVE-2025-40192: Revert "ipmi: fix msg stack when IPMI is disconnected"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "ipmi: fix msg stack when IPMI is disconnected"

This reverts commit c608966f3f9c2dca596967501d00753282b395fc.

This patch has a subtle bug that can cause the IPMI driver to go into an
infinite loop if the BMC misbehaves in a certain way.  Apparently
certain BMCs do misbehave this way because several reports have come in
recently about this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40192 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
