Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "drm/amd: Keep display off while going into S4"

commit 68bfdc8dc0a1a ("drm/amd: Keep display off while going into S4")
attempted to keep displays off during the S4 sequence by not resuming
display IP.  This however leads to hangs because DRM clients such as the
console can try to access registers and cause a hang.

(cherry picked from commit e485502c37b097b0bd773baa7e2741bf7bd2909a)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
