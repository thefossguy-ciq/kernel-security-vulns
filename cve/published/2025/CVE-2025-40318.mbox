Subject: CVE-2025-40318: Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix race in hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once

hci_cmd_sync_dequeue_once() does lookup and then cancel
the entry under two separate lock sections. Meanwhile,
hci_cmd_sync_work() can also delete the same entry,
leading to double list_del() and "UAF".

Fix this by holding cmd_sync_work_lock across both
lookup and cancel, so that the entry cannot be removed
concurrently.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40318 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
