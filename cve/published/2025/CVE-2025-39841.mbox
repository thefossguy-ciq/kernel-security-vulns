Subject: CVE-2025-39841: scsi: lpfc: Fix buffer free/clear order in deferred receive path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix buffer free/clear order in deferred receive path

Fix a use-after-free window by correcting the buffer release sequence in
the deferred receive path. The code freed the RQ buffer first and only
then cleared the context pointer under the lock. Concurrent paths (e.g.,
ABTS and the repost path) also inspect and release the same pointer under
the lock, so the old order could lead to double-free/UAF.

Note that the repost path already uses the correct pattern: detach the
pointer under the lock, then free it after dropping the lock. The
deferred path should do the same.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39841 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
