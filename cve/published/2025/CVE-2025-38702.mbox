Subject: CVE-2025-38702: fbdev: fix potential buffer overflow in do_register_framebuffer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: fix potential buffer overflow in do_register_framebuffer()

The current implementation may lead to buffer overflow when:
1.  Unregistration creates NULL gaps in registered_fb[]
2.  All array slots become occupied despite num_registered_fb < FB_MAX
3.  The registration loop exceeds array bounds

Add boundary check to prevent registered_fb[FB_MAX] access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38702 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
