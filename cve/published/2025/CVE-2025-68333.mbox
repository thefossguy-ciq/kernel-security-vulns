Subject: CVE-2025-68333: sched_ext: Fix possible deadlock in the deferred_irq_workfn()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: Fix possible deadlock in the deferred_irq_workfn()

For PREEMPT_RT=y kernels, the deferred_irq_workfn() is executed in
the per-cpu irq_work/* task context and not disable-irq, if the rq
returned by container_of() is current CPU's rq, the following scenarios
may occur:

lock(&rq->__lock);
<Interrupt>
  lock(&rq->__lock);

This commit use IRQ_WORK_INIT_HARD() to replace init_irq_work() to
initialize rq->scx.deferred_irq_work, make the deferred_irq_workfn()
is always invoked in hard-irq context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68333 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
