Subject: CVE-2025-40044: fs: udf: fix OOB read in lengthAllocDescs handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: udf: fix OOB read in lengthAllocDescs handling

When parsing Allocation Extent Descriptor, lengthAllocDescs comes from
on-disk data and must be validated against the block size. Crafted or
corrupted images may set lengthAllocDescs so that the total descriptor
length (sizeof(allocExtDesc) + lengthAllocDescs) exceeds the buffer,
leading udf_update_tag() to call crc_itu_t() on out-of-bounds memory and
trigger a KASAN use-after-free read.

BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in crc_itu_t+0x1d5/0x2b0 lib/crc-itu-t.c:60

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
