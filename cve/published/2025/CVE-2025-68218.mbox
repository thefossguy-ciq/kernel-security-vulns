Subject: CVE-2025-68218: nvme-multipath: fix lockdep WARN due to partition scan work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-multipath: fix lockdep WARN due to partition scan work

Blktests test cases nvme/014, 057 and 058 fail occasionally due to a
lockdep WARN. As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates that
a deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex,
kblockd workqueue completion and partition_scan_work completion.

To avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential deadlock, cut the dependency
by running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but by
nvme_wq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68218 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
