Subject: CVE-2025-38444: raid10: cleanup memleak at raid10_make_request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

raid10: cleanup memleak at raid10_make_request

If raid10_read_request or raid10_write_request registers a new
request and the REQ_NOWAIT flag is set, the code does not
free the malloc from the mempool.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
