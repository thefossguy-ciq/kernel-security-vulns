Subject: CVE-2025-38406: wifi: ath6kl: remove WARN on bad firmware input

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath6kl: remove WARN on bad firmware input

If the firmware gives bad input, that's nothing to do with
the driver's stack at this point etc., so the WARN_ON()
doesn't add any value. Additionally, this is one of the
top syzbot reports now. Just print a message, and as an
added bonus, print the sizes too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38406 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
