Subject: CVE-2025-22109: ax25: Remove broken autobind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: Remove broken autobind

Binding AX25 socket by using the autobind feature leads to memory leaks
in ax25_connect() and also refcount leaks in ax25_release(). Memory
leak was detected with kmemleak:

================================================================
unreferenced object 0xffff8880253cd680 (size 96):
backtrace:
__kmalloc_node_track_caller_noprof (./include/linux/kmemleak.h:43)
kmemdup_noprof (mm/util.c:136)

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:130)
================================================================

When socket is bound, refcounts must be incremented the way it is done
in ax25_bind() and ax25_setsockopt() (SO_BINDTODEVICE). In case of
autobind, the refcounts are not incremented.

This bug leads to the following issue reported by Syzkaller:

================================================================

Considering the issues above and the comments left in the code that say:
"check if we can remove this feature. It is broken."; "autobinding in this
may or may not work"; - it is better to completely remove this feature than
to fix it because it is broken and leads to various kinds of memory bugs.

Now calling connect() without first binding socket will result in an
error (-EINVAL). Userspace software that relies on the autobind feature
might get broken. However, this feature does not seem widely used with
this specific driver as it was not reliable at any point of time, and it
is already broken anyway. E.g. ax25-tools and ax25-apps packages for
popular distributions do not use the autobind feature for AF_AX25.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	include/net/ax25.h
	net/ax25/af_ax25.c
	net/ax25/ax25_route.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/61203fdd3e35519db9a98b6ff8983c620ffc4696
