Subject: CVE-2025-38321: smb: Log an error when close_all_cached_dirs fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: Log an error when close_all_cached_dirs fails

Under low-memory conditions, close_all_cached_dirs() can't move the
dentries to a separate list to dput() them once the locks are dropped.
This will result in a "Dentry still in use" error, so add an error
message that makes it clear this is what happened:

[  495.281119] CIFS: VFS: \\otters.example.com\share Out of memory while dropping dentries
[  495.281595] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  495.281887] BUG: Dentry ffff888115531138{i=78,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]
[  495.282391] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2329 at fs/dcache.c:1536 umount_check+0xc8/0xf0

Also, bail out of looping through all tcons as soon as a single
allocation fails, since we're already in trouble, and kmalloc() attempts
for subseqeuent tcons are likely to fail just like the first one did.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38321 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
