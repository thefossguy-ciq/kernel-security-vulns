Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix nullptr err of vm_handle_moved

If a amdgpu_bo_va is fpriv->prt_va, the bo of this one is always NULL.
So, such kind of amdgpu_bo_va should be updated separately before
amdgpu_vm_handle_moved.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40339 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47281febebe337586569aa4c5694a7511063a42e
