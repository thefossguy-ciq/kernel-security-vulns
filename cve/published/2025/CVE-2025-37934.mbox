Subject: CVE-2025-37934: ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix pointer check in graph_util_parse_link_direction

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix pointer check in graph_util_parse_link_direction

Actually check if the passed pointers are valid, before writing to them.
This also fixes a USBAN warning:
UBSAN: invalid-load in ../sound/soc/fsl/imx-card.c:687:25
load of value 255 is not a valid value for type '_Bool'

This is because playback_only is uninitialized and is not written to, as
the playback-only property is absent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37934 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
