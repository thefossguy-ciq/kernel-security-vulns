Subject: CVE-2025-37941: ASoC: codecs: wcd937x: fix a potential memory leak in wcd937x_soc_codec_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd937x: fix a potential memory leak in wcd937x_soc_codec_probe()

When snd_soc_dapm_new_controls() or snd_soc_dapm_add_routes() fails,
wcd937x_soc_codec_probe() returns without releasing 'wcd937x->clsh_info',
which is allocated by wcd_clsh_ctrl_alloc. Add wcd_clsh_ctrl_free()
to prevent potential memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
