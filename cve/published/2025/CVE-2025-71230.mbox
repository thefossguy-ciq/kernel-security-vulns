Subject: CVE-2025-71230: hfs: ensure sb->s_fs_info is always cleaned up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfs: ensure sb->s_fs_info is always cleaned up

When hfs was converted to the new mount api a bug was introduced by
changing the allocation pattern of sb->s_fs_info. If setup_bdev_super()
fails after a new superblock has been allocated by sget_fc(), but before
hfs_fill_super() takes ownership of the filesystem-specific s_fs_info
data it was leaked.

Fix this by freeing sb->s_fs_info in hfs_kill_super().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71230 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
