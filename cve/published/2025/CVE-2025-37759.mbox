Subject: CVE-2025-37759: ublk: fix handling recovery & reissue in ublk_abort_queue()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix handling recovery & reissue in ublk_abort_queue()

Commit 8284066946e6 ("ublk: grab request reference when the request is handled
by userspace") doesn't grab request reference in case of recovery reissue.
Then the request can be requeued & re-dispatch & failed when canceling
uring command.

If it is one zc request, the request can be freed before io_uring
returns the zc buffer back, then cause kernel panic:

[  126.773061] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c8

Fixes it by always grabbing request reference for aborting the request.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37759 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
