Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: init bioset in mddev_init

IO operations may be needed before md_run(), such as updating metadata
after writing sysfs. Without bioset, this triggers a NULL pointer
dereference as below:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020
 Call Trace:
  md_update_sb+0x658/0xe00
  new_level_store+0xc5/0x120
  md_attr_store+0xc9/0x1e0
  sysfs_kf_write+0x6f/0xa0

  do_syscall_64+0xa9/0x580
  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53

Reproducer
```
  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n2 /dev/sd[cd]
  echo inactive > /sys/block/md0/md/array_state
  echo 10 > /sys/block/md0/md/new_level
```

mddev_init() can only be called once per mddev, no need to test if bioset
has been initialized anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68368 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9d37fe37dfa0833a8768740f0575e0ffd793cb4a
