Subject: CVE-2025-21872: efi: Don't map the entire mokvar table to determine its size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: Don't map the entire mokvar table to determine its size

Currently, when validating the mokvar table, we (re)map the entire table
on each iteration of the loop, adding space as we discover new entries.
If the table grows over a certain size, this fails due to limitations of
early_memmap(), and we get a failure and traceback:

  ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---
  mokvar: Failed to map EFI MOKvar config table pa=0x7c4c3000, size=265187.

Mapping the entire structure isn't actually necessary, as we don't ever
need more than one entry header mapped at once.

Changes efi_mokvar_table_init() to only map each entry header, not the
entire table, when determining the table size.  Since we're not mapping
any data past the variable name, it also changes the code to enforce
that each variable name is NUL terminated, rather than attempting to
verify it in place.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
