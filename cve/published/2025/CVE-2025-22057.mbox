Subject: CVE-2025-22057: net: decrease cached dst counters in dst_release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: decrease cached dst counters in dst_release

Upstream fix ac888d58869b ("net: do not delay dst_entries_add() in
dst_release()") moved decrementing the dst count from dst_destroy to
dst_release to avoid accessing already freed data in case of netns
dismantle. However in case CONFIG_DST_CACHE is enabled and OvS+tunnels
are used, this fix is incomplete as the same issue will be seen for
cached dsts:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff5aabf6b5c000
  Call trace:
   percpu_counter_add_batch+0x3c/0x160 (P)
   dst_release+0xec/0x108
   dst_cache_destroy+0x68/0xd8
   dst_destroy+0x13c/0x168
   dst_destroy_rcu+0x1c/0xb0
   rcu_do_batch+0x18c/0x7d0
   rcu_core+0x174/0x378
   rcu_core_si+0x18/0x30

Fix this by invalidating the cache, and thus decrementing cached dst
counters, in dst_release too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22057 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
