Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer

The PCM OSS layer tries to clear the buffer with the silence data at
initialization (or reconfiguration) of a stream with the explicit call
of snd_pcm_format_set_silence() with runtime->dma_area.  But this may
lead to a UAF because the accessed runtime->dma_area might be freed
concurrently, as it's performed outside the PCM ops.

For avoiding it, move the code into the PCM core and perform it inside
the buffer access lock, so that it won't be changed during the
operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
