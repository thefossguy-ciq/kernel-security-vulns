Subject: CVE-2025-38528: bpf: Reject %p% format string in bprintf-like helpers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject %p% format string in bprintf-like helpers

static const char fmt[] = "%p%";
    bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt));

The above BPF program isn't rejected and causes a kernel warning at
runtime:

    Please remove unsupported %\x00 in format string
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7244 at lib/vsprintf.c:2680 format_decode+0x49c/0x5d0

This happens because bpf_bprintf_prepare skips over the second %,
detected as punctuation, while processing %p. This patch fixes it by
not skipping over punctuation. %\x00 is then processed in the next
iteration and rejected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38528 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
