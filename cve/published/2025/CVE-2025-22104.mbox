Subject: CVE-2025-22104: ibmvnic: Use kernel helpers for hex dumps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Use kernel helpers for hex dumps

Previously, when the driver was printing hex dumps, the buffer was cast
to an 8 byte long and printed using string formatters. If the buffer
size was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.

Therefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and
calls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.

This patch address KASAN reports like the one below:
  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Login Buffer:
  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 01000000af000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae6b1d6c1acee3a2000394d83ec9f1028321e207
