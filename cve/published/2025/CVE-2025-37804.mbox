Subject: CVE-2025-37804: io_uring: always do atomic put from iowq

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: always do atomic put from iowq

io_uring always switches requests to atomic refcounting for iowq
execution before there is any parallilism by setting REQ_F_REFCOUNT,
and the flag is not cleared until the request completes. That should be
fine as long as the compiler doesn't make up a non existing value for
the flags, however KCSAN still complains when the request owner changes
oter flag bits:

BUG: KCSAN: data-race in io_req_task_cancel / io_wq_free_work
...
read to 0xffff888117207448 of 8 bytes by task 3871 on cpu 0:
 req_ref_put_and_test io_uring/refs.h:22 [inline]

Skip REQ_F_REFCOUNT checks for iowq, we know it's set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37804 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
