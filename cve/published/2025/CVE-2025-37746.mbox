Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/dwc_pcie: fix duplicate pci_dev devices

During platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device
pci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev. Worse
still, accessing the duplicated device leads to list corruption as its
mutex content (e.g., list, magic) remains the same as the original.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37746 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.14.3 with commit a71c6fc87b2b9905dc2e38887fe4122287216be9
	Fixed in 6.15-rc1 with commit 7f35b429802a8065aa61e2a3f567089649f4d98e

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-37746
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/perf/dwc_pcie_pmu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a71c6fc87b2b9905dc2e38887fe4122287216be9
