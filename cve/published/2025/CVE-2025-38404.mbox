Subject: CVE-2025-38404: usb: typec: displayport: Fix potential deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: displayport: Fix potential deadlock

The deadlock can occur due to a recursive lock acquisition of
`cros_typec_altmode_data::mutex`.
The call chain is as follows:
1. cros_typec_altmode_work() acquires the mutex
2. typec_altmode_vdm() -> dp_altmode_vdm() ->
3. typec_altmode_exit() -> cros_typec_altmode_exit()
4. cros_typec_altmode_exit() attempts to acquire the mutex again

To prevent this, defer the `typec_altmode_exit()` call by scheduling
it rather than calling it directly from within the mutex-protected
context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38404 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
