Subject: CVE-2025-68172: crypto: aspeed - fix double free caused by devm

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aspeed - fix double free caused by devm

The clock obtained via devm_clk_get_enabled() is automatically managed
by devres and will be disabled and freed on driver detach. Manually
calling clk_disable_unprepare() in error path and remove function
causes double free.

Remove the manual clock cleanup in both aspeed_acry_probe()'s error
path and aspeed_acry_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68172 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
