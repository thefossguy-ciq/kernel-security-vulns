Subject: CVE-2025-21988: fs/netfs/read_collect: add to next->prev_donated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/netfs/read_collect: add to next->prev_donated

If multiple subrequests donate data to the same "next" request
(depending on the subrequest completion order), each of them would
overwrite the `prev_donated` field, causing data corruption and a
BUG() crash ("Can't donate prior to front").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21988 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.12 with commit ee4cdf7ba857a894ad1650d6ab77669cbbfa329e and fixed in 6.13.8 with commit e25cec3b76aba47a49138d2162fc809c6cd49c9e

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-21988
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/netfs/read_collect.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
