Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Harden uplink netdev access against device unbind

The function mlx5_uplink_netdev_get() gets the uplink netdevice
pointer from mdev->mlx5e_res.uplink_netdev. However, the netdevice can
be removed and its pointer cleared when unbound from the mlx5_core.eth
driver. This results in a NULL pointer, causing a kernel panic.

 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000001300
 at RIP: 0010:mlx5e_vport_rep_load+0x22a/0x270 [mlx5_core]
 Call Trace:

Ensure the pointer is valid before use by checking it for NULL. If it
is valid, immediately call netdev_hold() to take a reference, and
preventing the netdevice from being freed while it is in use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
