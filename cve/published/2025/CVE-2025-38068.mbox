Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: lzo - Fix compression buffer overrun

Unlike the decompression code, the compression code in LZO never
checked for output overruns.  It instead assumes that the caller
always provides enough buffer space, disregarding the buffer length
provided by the caller.

Add a safe compression interface that checks for the end of buffer
before each write.  Use the safe interface in crypto/lzo.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
