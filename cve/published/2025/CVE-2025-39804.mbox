Subject: CVE-2025-39804: lib/crypto: arm64/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/crypto: arm64/poly1305: Fix register corruption in no-SIMD contexts

Restore the SIMD usability check that was removed by commit a59e5468a921
("crypto: arm64/poly1305 - Add block-only interface").

This safety check is cheap and is well worth eliminating a footgun.
While the Poly1305 functions should not be called when SIMD registers
are unusable, if they are anyway, they should just do the right thing
instead of corrupting random tasks' registers and/or computing incorrect
MACs.  Fixing this is also needed for poly1305_kunit to pass.

Just use may_use_simd() instead of the original crypto_simd_usable(),
since poly1305_kunit won't rely on crypto_simd_disabled_for_test.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39804 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef74efa598b7bbc5c24509f7f56af2806f81c339
