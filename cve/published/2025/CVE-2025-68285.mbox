Subject: CVE-2025-68285: libceph: fix potential use-after-free in have_mon_and_osd_map()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libceph: fix potential use-after-free in have_mon_and_osd_map()

The wait loop in __ceph_open_session() can race with the client
receiving a new monmap or osdmap shortly after the initial map is
received.  Both ceph_monc_handle_map() and handle_one_map() install
a new map immediately after freeing the old one

    kfree(monc->monmap);
    monc->monmap = monmap;

    ceph_osdmap_destroy(osdc->osdmap);
    osdc->osdmap = newmap;

under client->monc.mutex and client->osdc.lock respectively, but
because neither is taken in have_mon_and_osd_map() it's possible for
client->monc.monmap->epoch and client->osdc.osdmap->epoch arms in

    client->monc.monmap && client->monc.monmap->epoch &&
        client->osdc.osdmap && client->osdc.osdmap->epoch;

condition to dereference an already freed map.  This happens to be
reproducible with generic/395 and generic/397 with KASAN enabled:

Rewrite the wait loop to check the above condition directly with
client->monc.mutex and client->osdc.lock taken as appropriate.  While
at it, improve the timeout handling (previously mount_timeout could be
exceeded in case wait_event_interruptible_timeout() slept more than
once) and access client->auth_err under client->monc.mutex to match
how it's set in finish_auth().

monmap_show() and osdmap_show() now take the respective lock before
accessing the map as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
