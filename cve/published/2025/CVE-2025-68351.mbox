Subject: CVE-2025-68351: exfat: fix refcount leak in exfat_find

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix refcount leak in exfat_find

Fix refcount leaks in `exfat_find` related to `exfat_get_dentry_set`.

Function `exfat_get_dentry_set` would increase the reference counter of
`es->bh` on success. Therefore, `exfat_put_dentry_set` must be called
after `exfat_get_dentry_set` to ensure refcount consistency. This patch
relocate two checks to avoid possible leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68351 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
