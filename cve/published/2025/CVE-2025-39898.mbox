Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

e1000e: fix heap overflow in e1000_set_eeprom

Fix a possible heap overflow in e1000_set_eeprom function by adding
input validation for the requested length of the change in the EEPROM.
In addition, change the variable type from int to size_t for better
code practices and rearrange declarations to RCT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39898 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
