Subject: CVE-2025-40013: ASoC: qcom: audioreach: fix potential null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: audioreach: fix potential null pointer dereference

It is possible that the topology parsing function
audioreach_widget_load_module_common() could return NULL or an error
pointer. Add missing NULL check so that we do not dereference it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40013 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
