Subject: CVE-2025-21906: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: clean up ROC on failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: clean up ROC on failure

If the firmware fails to start the session protection, then we
do call iwl_mvm_roc_finished() here, but that won't do anything
at all because IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING was never set.
Set IWL_MVM_STATUS_ROC_P2P_RUNNING in the failure/stop path.
If it started successfully before, it's already set, so that
doesn't matter, and if it didn't start it needs to be set to
clean up.

Not doing so will lead to a WARN_ON() later on a fresh remain-
on-channel, since the link is already active when activated as
it was never deactivated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21906 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
