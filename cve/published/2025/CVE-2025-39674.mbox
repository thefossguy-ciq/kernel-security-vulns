Subject: CVE-2025-39674: scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix ESI null pointer dereference

ESI/MSI is a performance optimization feature that provides dedicated
interrupts per MCQ hardware queue. This is optional feature and UFS MCQ
should work with and without ESI feature.

Commit e46a28cea29a ("scsi: ufs: qcom: Remove the MSI descriptor abuse")
brings a regression in ESI (Enhanced System Interrupt) configuration that
causes a null pointer dereference when Platform MSI allocation fails.

The issue occurs in when platform_device_msi_init_and_alloc_irqs() in
ufs_qcom_config_esi() fails (returns -EINVAL) but the current code uses
__free() macro for automatic cleanup free MSI resources that were never
successfully allocated.

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
address 0000000000000008

  Call trace:
  mutex_lock+0xc/0x54 (P)
  platform_device_msi_free_irqs_all+0x1c/0x40
  ufs_qcom_config_esi+0x1d0/0x220 [ufs_qcom]

  ufshcd_pltfrm_init+0x504/0x7d4
  ufs_qcom_probe+0x20/0x58 [ufs_qcom]

Fix by restructuring the ESI configuration to try MSI allocation first,
before any other resource allocation and instead use explicit cleanup
instead of __free() macro to avoid cleanup of unallocated resources.

Tested on SM8750 platform with MCQ enabled, both with and without
Platform ESI support.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39674 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aaf17a35a59572c8b29372883619c3dbb0ebb50a
