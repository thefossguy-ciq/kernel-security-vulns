Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in resource_build_scaling_params

Null pointer dereference issue could occur when pipe_ctx->plane_state
is null. The fix adds a check to ensure 'pipe_ctx->plane_state' is not
null before accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.

Found by code review.

(cherry picked from commit 63e6a77ccf239337baa9b1e7787cde9fa0462092)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
