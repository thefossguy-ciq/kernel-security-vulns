Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: ensure node page reads complete before f2fs_put_super() finishes

Xfstests generic/335, generic/336 sometimes crash with the following message:

F2FS-fs (dm-0): detect filesystem reference count leak during umount, type: 9, count: 1
------------[ cut here ]------------

It appears that sometimes it is possible that f2fs_put_super() is called before
all node page reads are completed.
Adding a call to f2fs_wait_on_all_pages() for F2FS_RD_NODE fixes the problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71107 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
