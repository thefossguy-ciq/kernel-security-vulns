Subject: CVE-2025-22066: ASoC: imx-card: Add NULL check in imx_card_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: imx-card: Add NULL check in imx_card_probe()

devm_kasprintf() returns NULL when memory allocation fails. Currently,
imx_card_probe() does not check for this case, which results in a NULL
pointer dereference.

Add NULL check after devm_kasprintf() to prevent this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22066 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
