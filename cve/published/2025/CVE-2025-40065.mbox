Subject: CVE-2025-40065: RISC-V: KVM: Write hgatp register with valid mode bits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RISC-V: KVM: Write hgatp register with valid mode bits

According to the RISC-V Privileged Architecture Spec, when MODE=Bare
is selected,software must write zero to the remaining fields of hgatp.

We have detected the valid mode supported by the HW before, So using a
valid mode to detect how many vmid bits are supported.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
