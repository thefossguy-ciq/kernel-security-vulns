Subject: CVE-2025-68360: wifi: mt76: wed: use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: wed: use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks

MT7996 driver can use both wed and wed_hif2 devices to offload traffic
from/to the wireless NIC. In the current codebase we assume to always
use the primary wed device in wed callbacks resulting in the following
crash if the hw runs wed_hif2 (e.g. 6GHz link).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
