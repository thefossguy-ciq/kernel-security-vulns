Subject: CVE-2025-38197: platform/x86: dell_rbu: Fix list usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: dell_rbu: Fix list usage

Pass the correct list head to list_for_each_entry*() when looping through
the packet list.

Without this patch, reading the packet data via sysfs will show the data
incorrectly (because it starts at the wrong packet), and clearing the
packet list will result in a NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
