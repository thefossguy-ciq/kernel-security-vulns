Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain

syzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the
`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in
the chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)
condition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.

To fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),
just before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being
executed when either of the following conditions is true:

1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free
chains in the allocation chain list
2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of
chains in the allocation chain list)

Either of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no
chains left for usage.

This is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints
the error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68771 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
