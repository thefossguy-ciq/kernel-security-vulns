Subject: CVE-2025-21901: RDMA/bnxt_re: Add sanity checks on rdev validity

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Add sanity checks on rdev validity

There is a possibility that ulp_irq_stop and ulp_irq_start
callbacks will be called when the device is in detached state.
This can cause a crash due to NULL pointer dereference as
the rdev is already freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21901 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
