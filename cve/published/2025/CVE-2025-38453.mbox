Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/msg_ring: ensure io_kiocb freeing is deferred for RCU

syzbot reports that defer/local task_work adding via msg_ring can hit
a request that has been freed:

which is supposed to be safe with how requests are allocated. But msg
ring requests alloc and free on their own, and hence must defer freeing
to a sane time.

Add an rcu_head and use kfree_rcu() in both spots where requests are
freed. Only the one in io_msg_tw_complete() is strictly required as it
has been visible on the other ring, but use it consistently in the other
spot as well.

This should not cause any other issues outside of KASAN rightfully
complaining about it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38453 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e5b3432f4a6b418b8bd8fc91f38efbf17a77167a
