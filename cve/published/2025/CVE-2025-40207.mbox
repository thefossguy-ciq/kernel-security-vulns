Subject: CVE-2025-40207: media: v4l2-subdev: Fix alloc failure check in v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-subdev: Fix alloc failure check in v4l2_subdev_call_state_try()

v4l2_subdev_call_state_try() macro allocates a subdev state with
__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc(), but does not check the returned value. If
__v4l2_subdev_state_alloc fails, it returns an ERR_PTR, and that would
cause v4l2_subdev_call_state_try() to crash.

Add proper error handling to v4l2_subdev_call_state_try().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
