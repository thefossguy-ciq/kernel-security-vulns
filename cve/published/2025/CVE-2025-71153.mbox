Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix memory leak in get_file_all_info()

In get_file_all_info(), if vfs_getattr() fails, the function returns
immediately without freeing the allocated filename, leading to a memory
leak.

Fix this by freeing the filename before returning in this error case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
