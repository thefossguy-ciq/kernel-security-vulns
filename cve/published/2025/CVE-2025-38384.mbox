Subject: CVE-2025-38384: mtd: spinand: fix memory leak of ECC engine conf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: spinand: fix memory leak of ECC engine conf

Memory allocated for the ECC engine conf is not released during spinand
cleanup. Below kmemleak trace is seen for this memory leak:

unreferenced object 0xffffff80064f00e0 (size 8):
  comm "swapper/0", pid 1, jiffies 4294937458
  hex dump (first 8 bytes):

Fix the leak by calling nanddev_ecc_engine_cleanup() inside
spinand_cleanup().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38384 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
