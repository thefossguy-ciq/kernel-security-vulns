Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/AER: Fix NULL pointer access by aer_info

The kzalloc(GFP_KERNEL) may return NULL, so all accesses to aer_info->xxx
will result in kernel panic. Fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68309 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.17.8 with commit 6618243bcc3f60825f761a41ed65fef9fe97eb25

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-68309
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
