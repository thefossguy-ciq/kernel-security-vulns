Subject: CVE-2025-22127: f2fs: fix potential deadloop in prepare_compress_overwrite()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix potential deadloop in prepare_compress_overwrite()

Jan Prusakowski reported a kernel hang issue as below:

When running xfstests on linux-next kernel (6.14.0-rc3, 6.12) I
encountered a problem in generic/475 test where fsstress process
gets blocked in __f2fs_write_data_pages() and the test hangs.
The options I used are:

MKFS_OPTIONS  -- -O compression -O extra_attr -O project_quota -O quota /dev/vdc
MOUNT_OPTIONS -- -o acl,user_xattr -o discard,compress_extension=* /dev/vdc /vdc

INFO: task kworker/u8:0:11 blocked for more than 122 seconds.
      Not tainted 6.14.0-rc3-xfstests-lockdep #1
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

 </TASK>

The root cause is: once generic/475 starts toload error table to dm
device, f2fs_prepare_compress_overwrite() will loop reading compressed
cluster pages due to IO error, meanwhile it has held .writepages lock,
it can block all other writeback tasks.

Let's fix this issue w/ below changes:
- add f2fs_handle_page_eio() in prepare_compress_overwrite() to
detect IO error.
- detect cp_error earler in f2fs_read_multi_pages().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22127 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7215cf8ef54bdc9082dffac4662416d54961e258
