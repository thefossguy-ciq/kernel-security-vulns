Subject: CVE-2025-40202: ipmi: Rework user message limit handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipmi: Rework user message limit handling

The limit on the number of user messages had a number of issues,
improper counting in some cases and a use after free.

Restructure how this is all done to handle more in the receive message
allocation routine, so all refcouting and user message limit counts
are done in that routine.  It's a lot cleaner and safer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
