Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: upper bound check of tree index in dbAllocAG

When computing the tree index in dbAllocAG, we never check if we are
out of bounds realative to the size of the stree.
This could happen in a scenario where the filesystem metadata are
corrupted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38697 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
