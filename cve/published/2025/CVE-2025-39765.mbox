Subject: CVE-2025-39765: ALSA: timer: fix ida_free call while not allocated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: timer: fix ida_free call while not allocated

In the snd_utimer_create() function, if the kasprintf() function return
NULL, snd_utimer_put_id() will be called, finally use ida_free()
to free the unallocated id 0.

the syzkaller reported the following information:
  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  ida_free called for id=0 which is not allocated.

The utimer->id should be set properly before the kasprintf() function,
ensures the snd_utimer_put_id() function will free the allocated id.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39765 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
