Subject: CVE-2025-40222: tty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling

The receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other
SCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory
offset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index
into the sci_port_params->regs array, as mentioned above the
sci_serial_in() function.

For RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call
inside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the
bounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified
by SCI_NR_REGS.

Because of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's
rsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,
happens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when
sci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the
supported register sizes.

The existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because
SCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not
present in the regs array.

Avoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard
register handling.

Use the ops->read_reg() and ops->write_reg() functions to properly read
and write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable
to accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.

sci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the
sci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used
for RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2ec9bbd09a6cdf5b8c726be34f29630faf585d07
