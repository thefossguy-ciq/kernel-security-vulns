Subject: CVE-2025-37778: ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate

krb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointer
to NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise
sess->user but that function may return without doing so. If
that happens then smb2_sess_setup, which calls krb_authenticate,
will be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess->user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37778 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
