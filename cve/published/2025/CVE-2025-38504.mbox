Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/zcrx: fix pp destruction warnings

With multiple page pools and in some other cases we can have allocated
niovs on page pool destruction. Remove a misplaced warning checking that
all niovs are returned to zcrx on io_pp_zc_destroy(). It was reported
before but apparently got lost.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38504 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ad9f1b5bed082b9c910e2a24bae0286a70846909
