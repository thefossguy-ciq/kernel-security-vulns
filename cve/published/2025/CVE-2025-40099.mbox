Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: parse_dfs_referrals: prevent oob on malformed input

Malicious SMB server can send invalid reply to FSCTL_DFS_GET_REFERRALS

- reply smaller than sizeof(struct get_dfs_referral_rsp)
- reply with number of referrals smaller than NumberOfReferrals in the
header

Processing of such replies will cause oob.

Return -EINVAL error on such replies to prevent oob-s.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40099 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
