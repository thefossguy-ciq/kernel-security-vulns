Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: handle csum tree error with rescue=ibadroots correctly

[BUG]
There is syzbot based reproducer that can crash the kernel, with the
following call trace: (With some debug output added)

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go "ro,rescue=ibadroots" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38260 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
