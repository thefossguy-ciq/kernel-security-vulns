Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Fix NULL pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_read_acpi()

The acpi_get_first_physical_node() function can return NULL, in which
case the get_device() function also returns NULL, but this value is
then dereferenced without checking,so add a check to prevent a crash.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68345 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
