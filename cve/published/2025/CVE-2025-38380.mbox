Subject: CVE-2025-38380: i2c/designware: Fix an initialization issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c/designware: Fix an initialization issue

The i2c_dw_xfer_init() function requires msgs and msg_write_idx from the
dev context to be initialized.

amd_i2c_dw_xfer_quirk() inits msgs and msgs_num, but not msg_write_idx.

This could allow an out of bounds access (of msgs).

Initialize msg_write_idx before calling i2c_dw_xfer_init().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38380 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
