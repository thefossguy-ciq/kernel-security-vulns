Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: detect invalid INLINE_DATA + EXTENTS flag combination

syzbot reported a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() when opening a verity
file on a corrupted ext4 filesystem mounted without a journal.

The issue is that the filesystem has an inode with both the INLINE_DATA
and EXTENTS flags set:

    EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_cache_extents:545: inode #15:
    comm syz.0.17: corrupted extent tree: lblk 0 < prev 66

Investigation revealed that the inode has both flags set:
    DEBUG: inode 15 - flag=1, i_inline_off=164, has_inline=1, extents_flag=1

This is an invalid combination since an inode should have either:
- INLINE_DATA: data stored directly in the inode
- EXTENTS: data stored in extent-mapped blocks

Having both flags causes ext4_has_inline_data() to return true, skipping
extent tree validation in __ext4_iget(). The unvalidated out-of-order
extents then trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() due to integer
underflow when calculating hole sizes.

Fix this by detecting this invalid flag combination early in ext4_iget()
and rejecting the corrupted inode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40167 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
