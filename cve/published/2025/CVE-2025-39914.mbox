Subject: CVE-2025-39914: tracing: Silence warning when chunk allocation fails in trace_pid_write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Silence warning when chunk allocation fails in trace_pid_write

Syzkaller trigger a fault injection warning:

We can reproduce the warning by following the steps below:
1. echo 8 >> set_event_notrace_pid. Let tr->filtered_pids owns one pid
   and register sched_switch tracepoint.
2. echo ' ' >> set_event_pid, and perform fault injection during chunk
   allocation of trace_pid_list_alloc. Let pid_list with no pid and
assign to tr->filtered_pids.
3. echo ' ' >> set_event_pid. Let pid_list is NULL and assign to
   tr->filtered_pids.
4. echo 9 >> set_event_pid, will trigger the double register
   sched_switch tracepoint warning.

The reason is that syzkaller injects a fault into the chunk allocation
in trace_pid_list_alloc, causing a failure in trace_pid_list_set, which
may trigger double register of the same tracepoint. This only occurs
when the system is about to crash, but to suppress this warning, let's
add failure handling logic to trace_pid_list_set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39914 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
