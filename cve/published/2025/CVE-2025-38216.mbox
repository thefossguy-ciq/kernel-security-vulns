Subject: CVE-2025-38216: iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 ("iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain")
changed the context entry setup during domain attachment from a
set-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently
introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI
bridges.

Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple
Macbooks with below messages:

 kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as

Fix this by restoring the previous context setup order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38216 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
