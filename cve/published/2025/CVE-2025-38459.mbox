Subject: CVE-2025-38459: atm: clip: Fix infinite recursive call of clip_push().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: clip: Fix infinite recursive call of clip_push().

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

This happens if we call ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) more than once.

During the first call, clip_mkip() sets clip_push() to vcc->push(),
and the second call copies it to clip_vcc->old_push().

Later, when the socket is close()d, vcc_destroy_socket() passes
NULL skb to clip_push(), which calls clip_vcc->old_push(),
triggering the infinite recursion.

Let's prevent the second ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) by checking
vcc->user_back, which is allocated by the first call as clip_vcc.

Note also that we use lock_sock() to prevent racy calls.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
