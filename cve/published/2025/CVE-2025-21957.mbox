Subject: CVE-2025-21957: scsi: qla1280: Fix kernel oops when debug level > 2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla1280: Fix kernel oops when debug level > 2

A null dereference or oops exception will eventually occur when qla1280.c
driver is compiled with DEBUG_QLA1280 enabled and ql_debug_level > 2.  I
think its clear from the code that the intention here is sg_dma_len(s) not
length of sg_next(s) when printing the debug info.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21957 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
