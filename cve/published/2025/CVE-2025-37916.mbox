Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: remove write-after-free of client_id

A use-after-free error popped up in stress testing:

[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025] BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free write in pdsc_auxbus_dev_del+0xef/0x160 [pds_core]
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025] Use-after-free write at 0x000000007013ecd1 (in kfence-#47):
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  pdsc_auxbus_dev_del+0xef/0x160 [pds_core]
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  pdsc_remove+0xc0/0x1b0 [pds_core]
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  pci_device_remove+0x24/0x70
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  device_release_driver_internal+0x11f/0x180
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  driver_detach+0x45/0x80
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  bus_remove_driver+0x83/0xe0
[Mon Apr 21 21:21:33 2025]  pci_unregister_driver+0x1a/0x80

The actual device uninit usually happens on a separate thread
scheduled after this code runs, but there is no guarantee of order
of thread execution, so this could be a problem.  There's no
actual need to clear the client_id at this point, so simply
remove the offending code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
