Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/reclaim: avoid divide-by-zero in damon_reclaim_apply_parameters()

When creating a new scheme of DAMON_RECLAIM, the calculation of
'min_age_region' uses 'aggr_interval' as the divisor, which may lead to
division-by-zero errors.  Fix it by directly returning -EINVAL when such a
case occurs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
