Subject: CVE-2025-68181: drm/radeon: Remove calls to drm_put_dev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: Remove calls to drm_put_dev()

Since the allocation of the drivers main structure was changed to
devm_drm_dev_alloc() drm_put_dev()'ing to trigger it to be free'd
should be done by devres.

However, drm_put_dev() is still in the probe error and device remove
paths. When the driver fails to probe warnings like the following are
shown because devres is trying to drm_put_dev() after the driver
already did it.

[    5.642230] radeon 0000:01:05.0: probe with driver radeon failed with error -22
[    5.649605] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[    5.649607] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
[    5.649620] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 357 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbe/0x110

(cherry picked from commit 3eb8c0b4c091da0a623ade0d3ee7aa4a93df1ea4)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68181 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
