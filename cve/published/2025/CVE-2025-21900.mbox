Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4: Fix a deadlock when recovering state on a sillyrenamed file

If the file is sillyrenamed, and slated for delete on close, it is
possible for a server reboot to triggeer an open reclaim, with can again
race with the application call to close(). When that happens, the call
to put_nfs_open_context() can trigger a synchronous delegreturn call
which deadlocks because it is not marked as privileged.

Instead, ensure that the call to nfs4_inode_return_delegation_on_close()
catches the delegreturn, and schedules it asynchronously.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21900 to this issue.

up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/nfs/delegation.c
	fs/nfs/delegation.h
	fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4fe4ae6c2e01d028856b73b6328b12b8945df871
