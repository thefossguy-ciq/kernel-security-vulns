Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: Fix sc7280 lpass potential buffer overflow

Case values introduced in commit
5f78e1fb7a3e ("ASoC: qcom: Add driver support for audioreach solution")
cause out of bounds access in arrays of sc7280 driver data (e.g. in case
of RX_CODEC_DMA_RX_0 in sc7280_snd_hw_params()).

Redefine LPASS_MAX_PORTS to consider the maximum possible port id for
q6dsp as sc7280 driver utilizes some of those values.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
