Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xenbus: Use kref to track req lifetime

Marek reported seeing a NULL pointer fault in the xenbus_thread
callstack:
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
RIP: e030:__wake_up_common+0x4c/0x180
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 __wake_up_common_lock+0x82/0xd0
 process_msg+0x18e/0x2f0
 xenbus_thread+0x165/0x1c0

process_msg+0x18e is req->cb(req).  req->cb is set to xs_wake_up(), a
thin wrapper around wake_up(), or xenbus_dev_queue_reply().  It seems
like it was xs_wake_up() in this case.

It seems like req may have woken up the xs_wait_for_reply(), which
kfree()ed the req.  When xenbus_thread resumes, it faults on the zero-ed
data.

Linux Device Drivers 2nd edition states:
"Normally, a wake_up call can cause an immediate reschedule to happen,
meaning that other processes might run before wake_up returns."
... which would match the behaviour observed.

Change to keeping two krefs on each request.  One for the caller, and
one for xenbus_thread.  Each will kref_put() when finished, and the last
will free it.

This use of kref matches the description in
Documentation/core-api/kref.rst

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37949 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
