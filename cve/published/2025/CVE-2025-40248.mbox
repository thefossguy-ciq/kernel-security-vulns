Subject: CVE-2025-40248: vsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established

During connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already
established socket leads to several issues:

1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->
   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking
   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated
   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.

2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket
   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap
   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.

3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a
   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for
   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a
   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.

Do not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected
sockets: they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by
sendmsg().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
