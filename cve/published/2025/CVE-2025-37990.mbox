Subject: CVE-2025-37990: wifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()

The function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() calls the function
brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The
'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized if the
function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to use
uninitialized variables in the conditions.

Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to error
handling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the
'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized.

Improve the error message to report more detailed error
information.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37990 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
