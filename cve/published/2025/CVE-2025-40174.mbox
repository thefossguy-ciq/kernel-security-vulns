Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm: Fix SMP ordering in switch_mm_irqs_off()

Stephen noted that it is possible to not have an smp_mb() between
the loaded_mm store and the tlb_gen load in switch_mm(), meaning the
ordering against flush_tlb_mm_range() goes out the window, and it
becomes possible for switch_mm() to not observe a recent tlb_gen
update and fail to flush the TLBs.

[ dhansen: merge conflict fixed by Ingo ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40174 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0fe5e3f5fb75c5d88dad24dece3ee75e9d87adeb
