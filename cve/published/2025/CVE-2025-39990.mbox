Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check the helper function is valid in get_helper_proto

kernel test robot reported verifier bug [1] where the helper func
pointer could be NULL due to disabled config option.

As Alexei suggested we could check on that in get_helper_proto
directly. Marking tail_call helper func with BPF_PTR_POISON,
because it is unused by design.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d429cb1278e995e22995ef117fa96d223a67e93
