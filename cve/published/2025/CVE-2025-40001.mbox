Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue

During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code
calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work
item mwq->work_q. However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to
use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while
mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the
already-freed mvs_info.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mvs_pci_remove()          |
  mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()
    cancel_delayed_work() |
      kfree(mvi)          |
                          |   mvi-> // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing
delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.

This bug was found by static analysis.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40001 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 2.6.31 with commit 20b09c2992fefbe78f8cede7b404fb143a413c52 and fixed in 6.18-rc1 with commit 60cd16a3b7439ccb699d0bf533799eeb894fd217

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-40001
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/scsi/mvsas/mv_init.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
