Subject: CVE-2025-40001: scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mvsas: Fix use-after-free bugs in mvs_work_queue

During the detaching of Marvell's SAS/SATA controller, the original code
calls cancel_delayed_work() in mvs_free() to cancel the delayed work
item mwq->work_q. However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the
cancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to
use-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while
mvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the
already-freed mvs_info.

A typical race condition is illustrated below:

CPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)
mvs_pci_remove()          |
  mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()
    cancel_delayed_work() |
      kfree(mvi)          |
                          |   mvi-> // UAF

Replace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure
that the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing
delayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.

This bug was found by static analysis.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
