Subject: CVE-2025-39893: spi: spi-qpic-snand: unregister ECC engine on probe error and device remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-qpic-snand: unregister ECC engine on probe error and device remove

The on-host hardware ECC engine remains registered both when
the spi_register_controller() function returns with an error
and also on device removal.

Change the qcom_spi_probe() function to unregister the engine
on the error path, and add the missing unregistering call to
qcom_spi_remove() to avoid possible use-after-free issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39893 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
