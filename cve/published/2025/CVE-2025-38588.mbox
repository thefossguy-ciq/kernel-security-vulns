Subject: CVE-2025-38588: ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()

While testing prior patch, I was able to trigger
an infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:

list_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, &f6i->fib6_siblings,
			fib6_siblings) {
	rt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling->fib6_nh, &nexthop_len);
}

This is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()
uses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,
because they might no longer see the head of the list.

Restart the loop if f6i->fib6_nsiblings is zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38588 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
