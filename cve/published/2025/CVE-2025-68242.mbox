Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix LTP test failures when timestamps are delegated

The utimes01 and utime06 tests fail when delegated timestamps are
enabled, specifically in subtests that modify the atime and mtime
fields using the 'nobody' user ID.

The problem can be reproduced as follow:

# echo "/media *(rw,no_root_squash,sync)" >> /etc/exports
# export -ra
# mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.2 127.0.0.1:/media /tmpdir
# cd /opt/ltp
# ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utimes01
# ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utime06

This issue occurs because nfs_setattr does not verify the inode's
UID against the caller's fsuid when delegated timestamps are
permitted for the inode.

This patch adds the UID check and if it does not match then the
request is sent to the server for permission checking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68242 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b2e4cda71ed062c87573b016d2d956a62f4258ed
