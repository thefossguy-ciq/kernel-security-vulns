Subject: CVE-2025-40262: Input: imx_sc_key - fix memory corruption on unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: imx_sc_key - fix memory corruption on unload

This is supposed to be "priv" but we accidentally pass "&priv" which is
an address in the stack and so it will lead to memory corruption when
the imx_sc_key_action() function is called.  Remove the &.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40262 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
