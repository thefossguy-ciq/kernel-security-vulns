Subject: CVE-2025-68263: ksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request

ipc_msg_send_request() waits for a generic netlink reply using an
ipc_msg_table_entry on the stack. The generic netlink handler
(handle_generic_event()/handle_response()) fills entry->response under
ipc_msg_table_lock, but ipc_msg_send_request() used to validate and free
entry->response without holding the same lock.

Under high concurrency this allows a race where handle_response() is
copying data into entry->response while ipc_msg_send_request() has just
freed it, leading to a slab-use-after-free reported by KASAN in
handle_generic_event():

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in handle_generic_event+0x3c4/0x5f0 [ksmbd]
  Write of size 12 at addr ffff888198ee6e20 by task pool/109349
  ...
  Freed by task:
    kvfree
    ipc_msg_send_request [ksmbd]
    ksmbd_rpc_open -> ksmbd_session_rpc_open [ksmbd]

Fix by:
- Taking ipc_msg_table_lock in ipc_msg_send_request() while validating
  entry->response, freeing it when invalid, and removing the entry from
  ipc_msg_table.
- Returning the final entry->response pointer to the caller only after
  the hash entry is removed under the lock.
- Returning NULL in the error path, preserving the original API
  semantics.

This makes all accesses to entry->response consistent with
handle_response(), which already updates and fills the response buffer
under ipc_msg_table_lock, and closes the race that allowed the UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68263 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
