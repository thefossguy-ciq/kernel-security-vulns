Subject: CVE-2025-38201: netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: clamp maximum map bucket size to INT_MAX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: clamp maximum map bucket size to INT_MAX

Otherwise, it is possible to hit WARN_ON_ONCE in __kvmalloc_node_noprof()
when resizing hashtable because __GFP_NOWARN is unset.

Similar to:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
