Subject: CVE-2025-38655: pinctrl: canaan: k230: add NULL check in DT parse

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: canaan: k230: add NULL check in DT parse

Add a NULL check for the return value of of_get_property() when
retrieving the "pinmux" property in the group parser. This avoids
a potential NULL pointer dereference if the property is missing
from the device tree node.

Also fix a typo ("sintenel") in the device ID match table comment,
correcting it to "sentinel".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38655 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
