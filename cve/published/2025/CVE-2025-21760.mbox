Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ndisc: extend RCU protection in ndisc_send_skb()

ndisc_send_skb() can be called without RTNL or RCU held.

Acquire rcu_read_lock() earlier, so that we can use dev_net_rcu()
and avoid a potential UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21760 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
