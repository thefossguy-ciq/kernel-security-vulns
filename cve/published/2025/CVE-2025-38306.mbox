Subject: CVE-2025-38306: fs/fhandle.c: fix a race in call of has_locked_children()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/fhandle.c: fix a race in call of has_locked_children()

may_decode_fh() is calling has_locked_children() while holding no locks.
That's an oopsable race...

The rest of the callers are safe since they are holding namespace_sem and
are guaranteed a positive refcount on the mount in question.

Rename the current has_locked_children() to __has_locked_children(), make
it static and switch the fs/namespace.c users to it.

Make has_locked_children() a wrapper for __has_locked_children(), calling
the latter under read_seqlock_excl(&mount_lock).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38306 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
