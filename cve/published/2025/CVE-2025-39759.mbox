Subject: CVE-2025-39759: btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the
rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from
the fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.

This happens as follows:

1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();

2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that
   point fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by
   task A);

3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups
   from fs_info->qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;

4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating
   the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,
   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding
   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().
Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas
were already disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39759 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
