Subject: CVE-2025-40039: ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix race condition in RPC handle list access

The 'sess->rpc_handle_list' XArray manages RPC handles within a ksmbd
session. Access to this list is intended to be protected by
'sess->rpc_lock' (an rw_semaphore). However, the locking implementation was
flawed, leading to potential race conditions.

In ksmbd_session_rpc_open(), the code incorrectly acquired only a read lock
before calling xa_store() and xa_erase(). Since these operations modify
the XArray structure, a write lock is required to ensure exclusive access
and prevent data corruption from concurrent modifications.

Furthermore, ksmbd_session_rpc_method() accessed the list using xa_load()
without holding any lock at all. This could lead to reading inconsistent
data or a potential use-after-free if an entry is concurrently removed and
the pointer is dereferenced.

Fix these issues by:
1. Using down_write() and up_write() in ksmbd_session_rpc_open()
   to ensure exclusive access during XArray modification, and ensuring
   the lock is correctly released on error paths.
2. Adding down_read() and up_read() in ksmbd_session_rpc_method()
   to safely protect the lookup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5cc679ba0f4505936124cd4179ba66bb0a4bd9f3
