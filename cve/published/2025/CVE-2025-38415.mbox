Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize

Syzkaller reports an "UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read" bug.

Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs
filesystem, issues an ioctl("/dev/loop0", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000). 
Now if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the
process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure
occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super()
fails.

----
msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE);
msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);
----

sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.

As a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2
is set to 64.

This subsequently causes the

UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/squashfs/block.c:195:36
shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka
'unsigned long long')

This commit adds a check for a 0 return by sb_min_blocksize().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38415 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
