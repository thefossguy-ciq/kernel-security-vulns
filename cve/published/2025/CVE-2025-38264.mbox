Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-tcp: sanitize request list handling

Validate the request in nvme_tcp_handle_r2t() to ensure it's not part of
any list, otherwise a malicious R2T PDU might inject a loop in request
list processing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38264 to this issue.

	drivers/nvme/host/tcp.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/78a4adcd3fedb0728436e8094848ebf4c6bae006
