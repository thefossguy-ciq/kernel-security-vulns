Subject: CVE-2025-40191: drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd process ref leaking when userptr unmapping

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix kfd process ref leaking when userptr unmapping

kfd_lookup_process_by_pid hold the kfd process reference to ensure it
doesn't get destroyed while sending the segfault event to user space.

Calling kfd_lookup_process_by_pid as function parameter leaks the kfd
process refcount and miss the NULL pointer check if app process is
already destroyed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
