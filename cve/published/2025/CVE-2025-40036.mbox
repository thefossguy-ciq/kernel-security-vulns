Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: fix possible map leak in fastrpc_put_args

copy_to_user() failure would cause an early return without cleaning up
the fdlist, which has been updated by the DSP. This could lead to map
leak. Fix this by redirecting to a cleanup path on failure, ensuring
that all mapped buffers are properly released before returning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40036 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
