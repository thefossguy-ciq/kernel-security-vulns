Subject: CVE-2025-37900: iommu: Fix two issues in iommu_copy_struct_from_user()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Fix two issues in iommu_copy_struct_from_user()

In the review for iommu_copy_struct_to_user() helper, Matt pointed out that
a NULL pointer should be rejected prior to dereferencing it:

And Alok pointed out a typo at the same time:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/480536af-6830-43ce-a327-adbd13dc3f1d@oracle.com

Since both issues were copied from iommu_copy_struct_from_user(), fix them
first in the current header.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37900 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
