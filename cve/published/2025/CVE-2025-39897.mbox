Subject: CVE-2025-39897: net: xilinx: axienet: Add error handling for RX metadata pointer retrieval

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: xilinx: axienet: Add error handling for RX metadata pointer retrieval

Add proper error checking for dmaengine_desc_get_metadata_ptr() which
can return an error pointer and lead to potential crashes or undefined
behaviour if the pointer retrieval fails.

Properly handle the error by unmapping DMA buffer, freeing the skb and
returning early to prevent further processing with invalid data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39897 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
