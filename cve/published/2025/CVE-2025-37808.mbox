Subject: CVE-2025-37808: crypto: null - Use spin lock instead of mutex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: null - Use spin lock instead of mutex

As the null algorithm may be freed in softirq context through
af_alg, use spin locks instead of mutexes to protect the default
null algorithm.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37808 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
