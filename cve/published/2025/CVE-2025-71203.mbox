Subject: CVE-2025-71203: riscv: Sanitize syscall table indexing under speculation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Sanitize syscall table indexing under speculation

The syscall number is a user-controlled value used to index into the
syscall table. Use array_index_nospec() to clamp this value after the
bounds check to prevent speculative out-of-bounds access and subsequent
data leakage via cache side channels.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71203 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.70 with commit c45848936ebdb4fcab92f8c39510db83c16d0239

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c45848936ebdb4fcab92f8c39510db83c16d0239
