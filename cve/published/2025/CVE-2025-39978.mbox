Subject: CVE-2025-39978: octeontx2-pf: Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-pf: Fix potential use after free in otx2_tc_add_flow()

This code calls kfree_rcu(new_node, rcu) and then dereferences "new_node"
and then dereferences it on the next line.  Two lines later, we take
a mutex so I don't think this is an RCU safe region.  Re-order it to do
the dereferences before queuing up the free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
