Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mld: avoid panic on init failure

In case of an error during init, in_hw_restart will be set, but it will
never get cleared.
Instead, we will retry to init again, and then we will act like we are in a
restart when we are actually not.

This causes (among others) to a NULL pointer dereference when canceling
rx_omi::finished_work, that was not even initialized, because we thought
that we are in hw_restart.

Set in_hw_restart to true only if the fw is running, then we know that
FW was loaded successfully and we are not going to the retry loop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38121 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/mld.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a26ec8e16958b6dd37dac9daf5fb6978fe0cb0b8
