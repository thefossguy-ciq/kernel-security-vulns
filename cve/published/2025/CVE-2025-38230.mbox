Subject: CVE-2025-38230: jfs: validate AG parameters in dbMount() to prevent crashes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: validate AG parameters in dbMount() to prevent crashes

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift
  (L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight) >= 0.
- agwidth: 1 to min(LPERCTL/MAXAG, 2^(L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight))
  ensures agperlev >= 1.
  - Ranges: 1-8 (agheight 0-3), 1-4 (agheight 4), 1 (agheight 5).
  - LPERCTL/MAXAG = 1024/128 = 8 limits leaves per AG;
    2^(10 - 2*agheight) prevents division to 0.
- agstart: 0 to CTLTREESIZE-1 - agwidth*(MAXAG-1) keeps ti within
  stree (size 1365).
  - Ranges: 0-1237 (agwidth 1), 0-348 (agwidth 8).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
