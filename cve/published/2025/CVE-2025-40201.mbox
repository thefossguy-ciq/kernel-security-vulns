Subject: CVE-2025-40201: kernel/sys.c: fix the racy usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64() paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernel/sys.c: fix the racy usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64() paths

The usage of task_lock(tsk->group_leader) in sys_prlimit64()->do_prlimit()
path is very broken.

sys_prlimit64() does get_task_struct(tsk) but this only protects task_struct
itself. If tsk != current and tsk is not a leader, this process can exit/exec
and task_lock(tsk->group_leader) may use the already freed task_struct.

Another problem is that sys_prlimit64() can race with mt-exec which changes
->group_leader. In this case do_prlimit() may take the wrong lock, or (worse)
->group_leader may change between task_lock() and task_unlock().

Change sys_prlimit64() to take tasklist_lock when necessary. This is not
nice, but I don't see a better fix for -stable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40201 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
