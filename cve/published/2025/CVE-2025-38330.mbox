Subject: CVE-2025-38330: firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)

KASAN reported out of bounds access - cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets().
The code uses mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes) for register value
allocations. But later, this length is set to 8 bytes which causes
test code failures.

As fix, just remove the lenght override, keeping the original value 4
for all operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38330 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.15.4 with commit e3dafc64b90546eb769f33333afabd9e3e915757
	Fixed in 6.16-rc1 with commit f4ba2ea57da51d616b689c4b8826c517ff5a8523

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-38330
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

	drivers/firmware/cirrus/test/cs_dsp_test_control_cache.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3dafc64b90546eb769f33333afabd9e3e915757
