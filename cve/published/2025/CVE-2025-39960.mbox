Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: acpi: initialize acpi_gpio_info struct

Since commit 7c010d463372 ("gpiolib: acpi: Make sure we fill struct
acpi_gpio_info"), uninitialized acpi_gpio_info struct are passed to
__acpi_find_gpio() and later in the call stack info->quirks is used in
acpi_populate_gpio_lookup. This breaks the i2c_hid_cpi driver:

[   58.122916] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: HID over i2c has not been provided an Int IRQ
[   58.123097] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-UNIW0001:00: probe with driver i2c_hid_acpi failed with error -22

Fix this by initializing the acpi_gpio_info pass to __acpi_find_gpio()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39960 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/27d94a2a52cbb54927c0140bd5b978c56e9a283a
