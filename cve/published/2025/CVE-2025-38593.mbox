Subject: CVE-2025-38593: Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix double free in 'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix double free in 'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'

Function 'hci_discovery_filter_clear()' frees 'uuids' array and then
sets it to NULL. There is a tiny chance of the following race:

'hci_cmd_sync_work()'

 'update_passive_scan_sync()'

   'hci_update_passive_scan_sync()'

     'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'
       kfree(uuids);

       <-------------------------preempted-------------------------------->
                                           'start_service_discovery()'

                                             'hci_discovery_filter_clear()'
                                               kfree(uuids); // DOUBLE FREE

       <-------------------------preempted-------------------------------->

      uuids = NULL;

To fix it let's add locking around 'kfree()' call and NULL pointer
assignment. Otherwise the following backtrace fires:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
