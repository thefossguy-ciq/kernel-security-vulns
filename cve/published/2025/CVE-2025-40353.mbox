Subject: CVE-2025-40353: arm64: mte: Do not warn if the page is already tagged in copy_highpage()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: mte: Do not warn if the page is already tagged in copy_highpage()

The arm64 copy_highpage() assumes that the destination page is newly
allocated and not MTE-tagged (PG_mte_tagged unset) and warns
accordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a ("mm: migrate:
support poisoned recover from migrate folio"), folio_mc_copy() is called
before __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the
copy will be done again to the same destination page. Since
copy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy
will warn.

Replace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64
copy_highpage() with a comment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40353 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
