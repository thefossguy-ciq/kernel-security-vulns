Subject: CVE-2025-38309: drm/xe/vm: move xe_svm_init() earlier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/vm: move xe_svm_init() earlier

In xe_vm_close_and_put() we need to be able to call xe_svm_fini(),
however during vm creation we can call this on the error path, before
having actually initialised the svm state, leading to various splats
followed by a fatal NPD.

(cherry picked from commit 4f296d77cf49fcb5f90b4674123ad7f3a0676165)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38309 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f5e6a6a8aa46d44ec7a240766cf3b7dd077718b9
