Subject: CVE-2025-39830: net/mlx5: HWS, Fix memory leak in hws_pool_buddy_init error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: HWS, Fix memory leak in hws_pool_buddy_init error path

In the error path of hws_pool_buddy_init(), the buddy allocator cleanup
doesn't free the allocator structure itself, causing a memory leak.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86d13a6f49cb68aa91bd718b1b627e72e77285c1
