Subject: CVE-2025-68236: scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)

According to UFS specifications, the power-off sequence for a UFS device
includes:

 - Sending an SSU command with Power_Condition=3 and await a response.

 - Asserting RST_N low.

 - Turning off REF_CLK.

 - Turning off VCC.

 - Turning off VCCQ/VCCQ2.

As part of ufs shutdown, after the SSU command completion, asserting
hardware reset (HWRST) triggers the device firmware to wake up and
execute its reset routine. This routine initializes hardware blocks and
takes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a
large current.

This large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is
supplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to
the regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power
mode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework
because UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if
the rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM
current thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this
state, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the
regulator.

To prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This
allows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active
and in high-power mode.

Currently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is
completed or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with
Qualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS vendors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68236 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b712f234a74c1f5ce70b5d7aec3fc2499c258141
