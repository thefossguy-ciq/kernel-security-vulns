Subject: CVE-2025-71104: KVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer

When advancing the target expiration for the guest's APIC timer in periodic
mode, set the expiration to "now" if the target expiration is in the past
(similar to what is done in update_target_expiration()).  Blindly adding
the period to the previous target expiration can result in KVM generating
a practically unbounded number of hrtimer IRQs due to programming an
expired timer over and over.  In extreme scenarios, e.g. if userspace
pauses/suspends a VM for an extended duration, this can even cause hard
lockups in the host.

Currently, the bug only affects Intel CPUs when using the hypervisor timer
(HV timer), a.k.a. the VMX preemption timer.  Unlike the software timer,
a.k.a. hrtimer, which KVM keeps running even on exits to userspace, the
HV timer only runs while the guest is active.  As a result, if the vCPU
does not run for an extended duration, there will be a huge gap between
the target expiration and the current time the vCPU resumes running.
Because the target expiration is incremented by only one period on each
timer expiration, this leads to a series of timer expirations occurring
rapidly after the vCPU/VM resumes.

More critically, when the vCPU first triggers a periodic HV timer
expiration after resuming, advancing the expiration by only one period
will result in a target expiration in the past.  As a result, the delta
may be calculated as a negative value.  When the delta is converted into
an absolute value (tscdeadline is an unsigned u64), the resulting value
can overflow what the HV timer is capable of programming.  I.e. the large
value will exceed the VMX Preemption Timer's maximum bit width of
cpu_preemption_timer_multi + 32, and thus cause KVM to switch from the
HV timer to the software timer (hrtimers).

After switching to the software timer, periodic timer expiration callbacks
may be executed consecutively within a single clock interrupt handler,
because hrtimers honors KVM's request for an expiration in the past and
immediately re-invokes KVM's callback after reprogramming.  And because
the interrupt handler runs with IRQs disabled, restarting KVM's hrtimer
over and over until the target expiration is advanced to "now" can result
in a hard lockup.

E.g. the following hard lockup was triggered in the host when running a
Windows VM (only relevant because it used the APIC timer in periodic mode)
after resuming the VM from a long suspend (in the host).

Moreover, if the suspend duration of the virtual machine is not long enough
to trigger a hard lockup in this scenario, since commit 98c25ead5eda
("KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer <=> hrtimer dance to common x86"), KVM
will continue using the software timer until the guest reprograms the APIC
timer in some way.  Since the periodic timer does not require frequent APIC
timer register programming, the guest may continue to use the software
timer in perpetuity.
