Subject: CVE-2025-39991: wifi: ath11k: fix NULL dereference in ath11k_qmi_m3_load()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix NULL dereference in ath11k_qmi_m3_load()

If ab->fw.m3_data points to data, then fw pointer remains null.
Further, if m3_mem is not allocated, then fw is dereferenced to be
passed to ath11k_err function.

Replace fw->size by m3_len.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
