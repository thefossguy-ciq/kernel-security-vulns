Subject: CVE-2025-68376: coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: ETR: Fix ETR buffer use-after-free issue

When ETR is enabled as CS_MODE_SYSFS, if the buffer size is changed
and enabled again, currently sysfs_buf will point to the newly
allocated memory(buf_new) and free the old memory(buf_old). But the
etr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed to buf_old, not
updated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory
use-after-free issue.

Fix this by checking ETR's mode before updating and releasing buf_old,
if the mode is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68376 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
