Subject: CVE-2025-40097: ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix missing pointer check in hda_component_manager_init function

The __component_match_add function may assign the 'matchptr' pointer
the value ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM), which will subsequently be dereferenced.

The call stack leading to the error looks like this:

hda_component_manager_init
|-> component_match_add
    |-> component_match_add_release
        |-> __component_match_add ( ... ,**matchptr, ... )
            |-> *matchptr = ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);       // assign
|-> component_master_add_with_match( ...  match)
    |-> component_match_realloc(match, match->num); // dereference

Add IS_ERR() check to prevent the crash.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40097 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
