Subject: CVE-2025-22074: ksmbd: fix r_count dec/increment mismatch

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix r_count dec/increment mismatch

r_count is only increased when there is an oplock break wait,
so r_count inc/decrement are not paired. This can cause r_count
to become negative, which can lead to a problem where the ksmbd
thread does not terminate.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22074 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
