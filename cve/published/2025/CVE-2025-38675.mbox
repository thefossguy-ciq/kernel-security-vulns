Subject: CVE-2025-38675: xfrm: state: initialize state_ptrs earlier in xfrm_state_find

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: state: initialize state_ptrs earlier in xfrm_state_find

In case of preemption, xfrm_state_look_at will find a different
pcpu_id and look up states for that other CPU. If we matched a state
for CPU2 in the state_cache while the lookup started on CPU1, we will
jump to "found", but the "best" state that we got will be ignored and
we will enter the "acquire" block. This block uses state_ptrs, which
isn't initialized at this point.

Let's initialize state_ptrs just after taking rcu_read_lock. This will
also prevent a possible misuse in the future, if someone adjusts this
function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38675 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
