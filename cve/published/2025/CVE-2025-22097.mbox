Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vkms: Fix use after free and double free on init error

If the driver initialization fails, the vkms_exit() function might
access an uninitialized or freed default_config pointer and it might
double free it.

Fix both possible errors by initializing default_config only when the
driver initialization succeeded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22097 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
