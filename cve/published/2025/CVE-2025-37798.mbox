Subject: CVE-2025-37798: codel: remove sch->q.qlen check before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

codel: remove sch->q.qlen check before qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()

After making all ->qlen_notify() callbacks idempotent, now it is safe to
remove the check of qlen!=0 from both fq_codel_dequeue() and
codel_qdisc_dequeue().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
