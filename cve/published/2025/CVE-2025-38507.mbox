Subject: CVE-2025-38507: HID: nintendo: avoid bluetooth suspend/resume stalls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: nintendo: avoid bluetooth suspend/resume stalls

Ensure we don't stall or panic the kernel when using bluetooth-connected
controllers. This was reported as an issue on android devices using
kernel 6.6 due to the resume hook which had been added for usb joycons.

First, set a new state value to JOYCON_CTLR_STATE_SUSPENDED in a
newly-added nintendo_hid_suspend. This makes sure we will not stall out
the kernel waiting for input reports during led classdev suspend. The
stalls could happen if connectivity is unreliable or lost to the
controller prior to suspend.

Second, since we lose connectivity during suspend, do not try
joycon_init() for bluetooth controllers in the nintendo_hid_resume path.

Tested via multiple suspend/resume flows when using the controller both
in USB and bluetooth modes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38507 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
