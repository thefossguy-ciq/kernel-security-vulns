Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/memfd: fix information leak in hugetlb folios

When allocating hugetlb folios for memfd, three initialization steps are
missing:

1. Folios are not zeroed, leading to kernel memory disclosure to userspace
2. Folios are not marked uptodate before adding to page cache
3. hugetlb_fault_mutex is not taken before hugetlb_add_to_page_cache()

The memfd allocation path bypasses the normal page fault handler
(hugetlb_no_page) which would handle all of these initialization steps. 
This is problematic especially for udmabuf use cases where folios are
pinned and directly accessed by userspace via DMA.

Fix by matching the initialization pattern used in hugetlb_no_page():
- Zero the folio using folio_zero_user() which is optimized for huge pages
- Mark it uptodate with folio_mark_uptodate()
- Take hugetlb_fault_mutex before adding to page cache to prevent races

The folio_zero_user() change also fixes a potential security issue where
uninitialized kernel memory could be disclosed to userspace through read()
or mmap() operations on the memfd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68292 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
