Subject: CVE-2025-39783: PCI: endpoint: Fix configfs group list head handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: Fix configfs group list head handling

Doing a list_del() on the epf_group field of struct pci_epf_driver in
pci_epf_remove_cfs() is not correct as this field is a list head, not
a list entry. This list_del() call triggers a KASAN warning when an
endpoint function driver which has a configfs attribute group is torn
down:

==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pci_epf_remove_cfs+0x17c/0x198

Remove this incorrect list_del() call from pci_epf_remove_cfs().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39783 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
