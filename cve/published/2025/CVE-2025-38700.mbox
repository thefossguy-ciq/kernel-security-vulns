Subject: CVE-2025-38700: scsi: libiscsi: Initialize iscsi_conn->dd_data only if memory is allocated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: libiscsi: Initialize iscsi_conn->dd_data only if memory is allocated

In case of an ib_fast_reg_mr allocation failure during iSER setup, the
machine hits a panic because iscsi_conn->dd_data is initialized
unconditionally, even when no memory is allocated (dd_size == 0).  This
leads invalid pointer dereference during connection teardown.

Fix by setting iscsi_conn->dd_data only if memory is actually allocated.

Panic trace:
------------
 iser: iser_create_fastreg_desc: Failed to allocate ib_fast_reg_mr err=-12
 iser: iser_alloc_rx_descriptors: failed allocating rx descriptors / data buffers
 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffffffffffff8

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
