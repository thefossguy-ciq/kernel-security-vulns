Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: hfi: add check to handle incorrect queue size

qsize represents size of shared queued between driver and video
firmware. Firmware can modify this value to an invalid large value. In
such situation, empty_space will be bigger than the space actually
available. Since new_wr_idx is not checked, so the following code will
result in an OOB write.
...
qsize = qhdr->q_size

if (wr_idx >= rd_idx)
 empty_space = qsize - (wr_idx - rd_idx)
....
if (new_wr_idx < qsize) {
 memcpy(wr_ptr, packet, dwords << 2) --> OOB write

Add check to ensure qsize is within the allocated size while
reading and writing packets into the queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
