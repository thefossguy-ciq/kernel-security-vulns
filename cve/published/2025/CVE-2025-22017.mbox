Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devlink: fix xa_alloc_cyclic() error handling

In case of returning 1 from xa_alloc_cyclic() (wrapping) ERR_PTR(1) will
be returned, which will cause IS_ERR() to be false. Which can lead to
dereference not allocated pointer (rel).

Fix it by checking if err is lower than zero.

This wasn't found in real usecase, only noticed. Credit to Pierre.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
