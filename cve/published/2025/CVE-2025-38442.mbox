Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: reject bs > ps block devices when THP is disabled

If THP is disabled and when a block device with logical block size >
page size is present, the following null ptr deref panic happens during
boot:

[   [13.2 mK  AOSAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000K0 0 0[07]

As large folio support depends on THP, only allow bs > ps block devices
if THP is enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38442 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
