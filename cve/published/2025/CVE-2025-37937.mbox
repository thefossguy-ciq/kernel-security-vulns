Subject: CVE-2025-37937: objtool, media: dib8000: Prevent divide-by-zero in dib8000_set_dds()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool, media: dib8000: Prevent divide-by-zero in dib8000_set_dds()

If dib8000_set_dds()'s call to dib8000_read32() returns zero, the result
is a divide-by-zero.  Prevent that from happening.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  drivers/media/dvb-frontends/dib8000.o: warning: objtool: dib8000_tune() falls through to next function dib8096p_cfg_DibRx()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37937 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
