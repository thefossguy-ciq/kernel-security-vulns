Subject: CVE-2025-38569: benet: fix BUG when creating VFs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

benet: fix BUG when creating VFs

benet crashes as soon as SRIOV VFs are created:

 kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:3457!
 Oops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN NOPTI

be_cmd_set_mac_list() calls dma_free_coherent() under a spin_lock_bh.
Fix it by freeing only after the lock has been released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38569 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
