Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: add validation for ring_len param

The `ring_len` parameter provided by the virtual function (VF)
is assigned directly to the hardware memory context (HMC) without
any validation.

To address this, introduce an upper boundary check for both Tx and Rx
queue lengths. The maximum number of descriptors supported by the
hardware is 8k-32.
Additionally, enforce alignment constraints: Tx rings must be a multiple
of 8, and Rx rings must be a multiple of 32.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
