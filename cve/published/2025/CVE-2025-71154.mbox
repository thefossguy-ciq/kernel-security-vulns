Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: rtl8150: fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure

In async_set_registers(), when usb_submit_urb() fails, the allocated
  async_req structure and URB are not freed, causing a memory leak.

  The completion callback async_set_reg_cb() is responsible for freeing
  these allocations, but it is only called after the URB is successfully
  submitted and completes (successfully or with error). If submission
  fails, the callback never runs and the memory is leaked.

  Fix this by freeing both the URB and the request structure in the error
  path when usb_submit_urb() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71154 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
