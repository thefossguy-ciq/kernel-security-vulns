Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera

The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that
is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional
sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up
an unresponsive sensor.

  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff
  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1, 2:1, 3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff

Add this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21992 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
