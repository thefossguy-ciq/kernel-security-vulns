Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: cs42l43: Property entry should be a null-terminated array

The software node does not specify a count of property entries, so the
array must be null-terminated.

When unterminated, this can lead to a fault in the downstream cs35l56
amplifier driver, because the node parse walks off the end of the
array into unknown memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38573 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
