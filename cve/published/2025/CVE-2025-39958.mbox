Subject: CVE-2025-39958: iommu/s390: Make attach succeed when the device was surprise removed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/s390: Make attach succeed when the device was surprise removed

When a PCI device is removed with surprise hotplug, there may still be
attempts to attach the device to the default domain as part of tear down
via (__iommu_release_dma_ownership()), or because the removal happens
during probe (__iommu_probe_device()). In both cases zpci_register_ioat()
fails with a cc value indicating that the device handle is invalid. This
is because the device is no longer part of the instance as far as the
hypervisor is concerned.

Currently this leads to an error return and s390_iommu_attach_device()
fails. This triggers the WARN_ON() in __iommu_group_set_domain_nofail()
because attaching to the default domain must never fail.

With the device fenced by the hypervisor no DMAs to or from memory are
possible and the IOMMU translations have no effect. Proceed as if the
registration was successful and let the hotplug event handling clean up
the device.

This is similar to how devices in the error state are handled since
commit 59bbf596791b ("iommu/s390: Make attach succeed even if the device
is in error state") except that for removal the domain will not be
registered later. This approach was also previously discussed at the
link.

Handle both cases, error state and removal, in a helper which checks if
the error needs to be propagated or ignored. Avoid magic number
condition codes by using the pre-existing, but never used, defines for
PCI load/store condition codes and rename them to reflect that they
apply to all PCI instructions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39958 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.16.9 with commit 359613f2fa009587154511e4842e8ab9532edd15

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-39958
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/s390/include/asm/pci_insn.h
	drivers/iommu/s390-iommu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/359613f2fa009587154511e4842e8ab9532edd15
