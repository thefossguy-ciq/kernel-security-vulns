Subject: CVE-2025-38627: f2fs: compress: fix UAF of f2fs_inode_info in f2fs_free_dic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix UAF of f2fs_inode_info in f2fs_free_dic

The decompress_io_ctx may be released asynchronously after
I/O completion. If this file is deleted immediately after read,
and the kworker of processing post_read_wq has not been executed yet
due to high workloads, It is possible that the inode(f2fs_inode_info)
is evicted and freed before it is used f2fs_free_dic.

    The UAF case as below:
    Thread A                                      Thread B
    - f2fs_decompress_end_io
     - f2fs_put_dic
      - queue_work
        add free_dic work to post_read_wq
                                                   - do_unlink
                                                    - iput
                                                     - evict
                                                      - call_rcu
    This file is deleted after read.

    Thread C                                 kworker to process post_read_wq
    - rcu_do_batch
     - f2fs_free_inode
      - kmem_cache_free
     inode is freed by rcu
                                             - process_scheduled_works
                                              - f2fs_late_free_dic
                                               - f2fs_free_dic
                                                - f2fs_release_decomp_mem
                                      read (dic->inode)->i_compress_algorithm

This patch store compress_algorithm and sbi in dic to avoid inode UAF.

In addition, the previous solution is deprecated in [1] may cause system hang.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/f2fs/compress.c
	fs/f2fs/f2fs.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8fae5b6addd5f6895e03797b56e3c7b9f9cd15c9
