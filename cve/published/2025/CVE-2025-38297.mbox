Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM: EM: Fix potential division-by-zero error in em_compute_costs()

When the device is of a non-CPU type, table[i].performance won't be
initialized in the previous em_init_performance(), resulting in division
by zero when calculating costs in em_compute_costs().

Since the 'cost' algorithm is only used for EAS energy efficiency
calculations and is currently not utilized by other device drivers, we
should add the _is_cpu_device(dev) check to prevent this division-by-zero
issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38297 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81d72f9241d884ec29524431f74f8009310cfa0c
