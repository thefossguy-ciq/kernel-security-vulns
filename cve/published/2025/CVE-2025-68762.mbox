Subject: CVE-2025-68762: net: netpoll: initialize work queue before error checks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netpoll: initialize work queue before error checks

Prevent a kernel warning when netconsole setup fails on devices with
IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL flag. The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in
__flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an
uninitialized work queue.

When __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL,
it fails early and calls skb_pool_flush() for cleanup. This function
calls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn't been
initialized yet, triggering the warning.

Move INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(), ensuring the
work queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points.
This allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless
of where the setup fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68762 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
