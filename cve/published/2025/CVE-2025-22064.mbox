Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: don't unregister hook when table is dormant

When nf_tables_updchain encounters an error, hook registration needs to
be rolled back.

This should only be done if the hook has been registered, which won't
happen when the table is flagged as dormant (inactive).

Just move the assignment into the registration block.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22064 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
