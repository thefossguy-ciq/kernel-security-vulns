Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: fix null-ptr-deref when acquiring remote ip of ethernet bearer

The reproduction steps:
1. create a tun interface
2. enable l2 bearer
3. TIPC_NL_UDP_GET_REMOTEIP with media name set to tun

tipc: Started in network mode
tipc: Node identity 8af312d38a21, cluster identity 4711
tipc: Enabled bearer <eth:syz_tun>, priority 1
Oops: general protection fault
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range
CPU: 1 UID: 1000 PID: 559 Comm: poc Not tainted 6.16.0-rc1+ #117 PREEMPT
Hardware name: QEMU Ubuntu 24.04 PC
RIP: 0010:tipc_udp_nl_dump_remoteip+0x4a4/0x8f0

the ub was in fact a struct dev.

when bid != 0 && skip_cnt != 0, bearer_list[bid] may be NULL or
other media when other thread changes it.

fix this by checking media_id.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
