Subject: CVE-2025-68357: iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well

Since commit 222f2c7c6d14 ("iomap: always run error completions in user
context"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This
means the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68357 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.18.2 with commit c67775cf0da2407f113c1229e350758f4dca0f51
	Fixed in 6.19-rc1 with commit 7fd8720dff2d9c70cf5a1a13b7513af01952ec02

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-68357
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/iomap/direct-io.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
