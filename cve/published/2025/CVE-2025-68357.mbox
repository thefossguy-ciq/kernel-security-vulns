Subject: CVE-2025-68357: iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iomap: allocate s_dio_done_wq for async reads as well

Since commit 222f2c7c6d14 ("iomap: always run error completions in user
context"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This
means the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68357 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
