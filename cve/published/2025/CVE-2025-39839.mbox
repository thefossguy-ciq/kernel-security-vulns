Subject: CVE-2025-39839: batman-adv: fix OOB read/write in network-coding decode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

batman-adv: fix OOB read/write in network-coding decode

batadv_nc_skb_decode_packet() trusts coded_len and checks only against
skb->len. XOR starts at sizeof(struct batadv_unicast_packet), reducing
payload headroom, and the source skb length is not verified, allowing an
out-of-bounds read and a small out-of-bounds write.

Validate that coded_len fits within the payload area of both destination
and source sk_buffs before XORing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
