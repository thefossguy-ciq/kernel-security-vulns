Subject: CVE-2025-68190: drm/amdgpu/atom: Check kcalloc() for WS buffer in amdgpu_atom_execute_table_locked()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu/atom: Check kcalloc() for WS buffer in amdgpu_atom_execute_table_locked()

kcalloc() may fail. When WS is non-zero and allocation fails, ectx.ws
remains NULL while ectx.ws_size is set, leading to a potential NULL
pointer dereference in atom_get_src_int() when accessing WS entries.

Return -ENOMEM on allocation failure to avoid the NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68190 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
