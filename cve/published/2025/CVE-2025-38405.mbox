Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix memory leak of bio integrity

If nvmet receives commands with metadata there is a continuous memory
leak of kmalloc-128 slab or more precisely bio->bi_integrity.

Since commit bf4c89fc8797 ("block: don't call bio_uninit from bio_endio")
each user of bio_init has to use bio_uninit as well. Otherwise the bio
integrity is not getting free. Nvmet uses bio_init for inline bios.

Uninit the inline bio to complete deallocation of integrity in bio.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38405 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
