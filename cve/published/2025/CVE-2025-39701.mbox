Subject: CVE-2025-39701: ACPI: pfr_update: Fix the driver update version check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: pfr_update: Fix the driver update version check

The security-version-number check should be used rather
than the runtime version check for driver updates.

Otherwise, the firmware update would fail when the update binary had
a lower runtime version number than the current one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39701 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
