Subject: CVE-2025-68254: staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing

The Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed
*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these
offsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with
an ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an
out-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.

Add a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent
bytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access
them.

This prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon frames.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68254 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
