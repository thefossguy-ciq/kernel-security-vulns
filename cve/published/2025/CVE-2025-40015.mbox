Subject: CVE-2025-40015: media: stm32-csi: Fix dereference before NULL check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: stm32-csi: Fix dereference before NULL check

In 'stm32_csi_start', 'csidev->s_subdev' is dereferenced directly while
assigning a value to the 'src_pad'. However the same value is being
checked against NULL at a later point of time indicating that there
are chances that the value can be NULL.

Move the dereference after the NULL check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
