Subject: CVE-2025-38496: dm-bufio: fix sched in atomic context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-bufio: fix sched in atomic context

If "try_verify_in_tasklet" is set for dm-verity, DM_BUFIO_CLIENT_NO_SLEEP
is enabled for dm-bufio. However, when bufio tries to evict buffers, there
is a chance to trigger scheduling in spin_lock_bh, the following warning
is hit:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at drivers/md/dm-bufio.c:2745
in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 123, name: kworker/2:2

That can be reproduced by:

  SIZE=$(blockdev --getsz /dev/vda)
  dmsetup create myverity -r --table "0 $SIZE verity 1 /dev/vda /dev/vdb 4096 4096 <data_blocks> 1 sha256 <root_hash> <salt> 1 try_verify_in_tasklet"
  mount /dev/dm-0 /mnt -o ro
  echo 102400 > /sys/module/dm_bufio/parameters/max_cache_size_bytes

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38496 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
