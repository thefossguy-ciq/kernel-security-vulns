Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Avoid use of NULL after WARN_ON_ONCE

There is a WARN_ON_ONCE to catch an unlikely situation when
domain_remove_dev_pasid can't find the `pasid`. In case it nevertheless
happens we must avoid using a NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21833 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.13.3 with commit df96876be3b064aefc493f760e0639765d13ed0d
	Fixed in 6.14-rc1 with commit 60f030f7418d3f1d94f2fb207fe3080e1844630b

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-21833
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/iommu/intel/iommu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df96876be3b064aefc493f760e0639765d13ed0d
