Subject: CVE-2025-37932: sch_htb: make htb_qlen_notify() idempotent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_htb: make htb_qlen_notify() idempotent

htb_qlen_notify() always deactivates the HTB class and in fact could
trigger a warning if it is already deactivated. Therefore, it is not
idempotent and not friendly to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue().

Let's make it idempotent to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers'
life.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37932 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
