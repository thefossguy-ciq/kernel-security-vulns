Subject: CVE-2025-39814: ice: fix NULL pointer dereference in ice_unplug_aux_dev() on reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix NULL pointer dereference in ice_unplug_aux_dev() on reset

Issuing a reset when the driver is loaded without RDMA support, will
results in a crash as it attempts to remove RDMA's non-existent auxbus
device:
echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<if>/device/reset

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
...
RIP: 0010:ice_unplug_aux_dev+0x29/0x70 [ice]
...
Call Trace:
<TASK>
ice_prepare_for_reset+0x77/0x260 [ice]
pci_dev_save_and_disable+0x2c/0x70

ice_unplug_aux_dev() checks pf->cdev_info->adev for NULL pointer, but
pf->cdev_info will also be NULL, leading to the deref in the trace above.

Introduce a flag to be set when the creation of the auxbus device is
successful, to avoid multiple NULL pointer checks in ice_unplug_aux_dev().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39814 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db783756a7d7cfaea039411971d0dc0a374e85cb
