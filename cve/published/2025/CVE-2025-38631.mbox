Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: imx95-blk-ctl: Fix synchronous abort

When enabling runtime PM for clock suppliers that also belong to a power
domain, the following crash is thrown:
error: synchronous external abort: 0000000096000010 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
Workqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func
pstate: 60400009 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)
pc : clk_mux_get_parent+0x60/0x90
lr : clk_core_reparent_orphans_nolock+0x58/0xd8
  Call trace:
   clk_mux_get_parent+0x60/0x90
   clk_core_reparent_orphans_nolock+0x58/0xd8
   of_clk_add_hw_provider.part.0+0x90/0x100
   of_clk_add_hw_provider+0x1c/0x38
   imx95_bc_probe+0x2e0/0x3f0
   platform_probe+0x70/0xd8

Enabling runtime PM without explicitly resuming the device caused
the power domain cut off after clk_register() is called. As a result,
a crash happens when the clock hardware provider is added and attempts
to access the BLK_CTL register.

Fix this by using devm_pm_runtime_enable() instead of pm_runtime_enable()
and getting rid of the pm_runtime_disable() in the cleanup path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38631 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
