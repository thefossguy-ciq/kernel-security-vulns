Subject: CVE-2025-68343: can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: gs_usb: gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback(): check actual_length before accessing header

The driver expects to receive a struct gs_host_frame in
gs_usb_receive_bulk_callback().

Use struct_group to describe the header of the struct gs_host_frame and
check that we have at least received the header before accessing any
members of it.

To resubmit the URB, do not dereference the pointer chain
"dev->parent->hf_size_rx" but use "parent->hf_size_rx" instead. Since
"urb->context" contains "parent", it is always defined, while "dev" is not
defined if the URB it too short.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68343 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
