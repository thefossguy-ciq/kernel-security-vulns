Subject: CVE-2025-38109: net/mlx5: Fix ECVF vports unload on shutdown flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix ECVF vports unload on shutdown flow

Fix shutdown flow UAF when a virtual function is created on the embedded
chip (ECVF) of a BlueField device. In such case the vport acl ingress
table is not properly destroyed.

ECVF functionality is independent of ecpf_vport_exists capability and
thus functions mlx5_eswitch_(enable|disable)_pf_vf_vports() should not
test it when enabling/disabling ECVF vports.

kernel log:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
