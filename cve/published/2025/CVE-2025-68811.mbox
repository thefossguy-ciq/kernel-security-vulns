Subject: CVE-2025-68811: svcrdma: use rc_pageoff for memcpy byte offset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

svcrdma: use rc_pageoff for memcpy byte offset

svc_rdma_copy_inline_range added rc_curpage (page index) to the page
base instead of the byte offset rc_pageoff. Use rc_pageoff so copies
land within the current page.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
