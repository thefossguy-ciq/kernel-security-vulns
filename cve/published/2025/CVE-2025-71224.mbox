Subject: CVE-2025-71224: wifi: mac80211: ocb: skip rx_no_sta when interface is not joined

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: ocb: skip rx_no_sta when interface is not joined

ieee80211_ocb_rx_no_sta() assumes a valid channel context, which is only
present after JOIN_OCB.

RX may run before JOIN_OCB is executed, in which case the OCB interface
is not operational. Skip RX peer handling when the interface is not
joined to avoid warnings in the RX path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71224 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
