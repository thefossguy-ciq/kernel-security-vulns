Subject: CVE-2025-68338: net: dsa: microchip: Don't free uninitialized ksz_irq

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: microchip: Don't free uninitialized ksz_irq

If something goes wrong at setup, ksz_irq_free() can be called on
uninitialized ksz_irq (for example when ksz_ptp_irq_setup() fails). It
leads to freeing uninitialized IRQ numbers and/or domains.

Use dsa_switch_for_each_user_port_continue_reverse() in the error path
to iterate only over the fully initialized ports.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68338 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
