Subject: CVE-2025-40139: smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in in smc_clc_prfx_set().

smc_clc_prfx_set() is called during connect() and not under RCU
nor RTNL.

Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dev_dst_rcu() under rcu_read_lock()
after kernel_getsockname().

Note that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_set() is not used
in the caller.

While at it, we change the 1st arg of smc_clc_prfx_set[46]_rcu()
not to touch dst there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40139 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
