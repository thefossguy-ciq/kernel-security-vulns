Subject: CVE-2025-68347: ALSA: firewire-motu: fix buffer overflow in hwdep read for DSP events

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: firewire-motu: fix buffer overflow in hwdep read for DSP events

The DSP event handling code in hwdep_read() could write more bytes to
the user buffer than requested, when a user provides a buffer smaller
than the event header size (8 bytes).

Fix by using min_t() to clamp the copy size, This ensures we never copy
more than the user requested.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68347 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
