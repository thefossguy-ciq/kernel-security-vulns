Subject: CVE-2025-38040: serial: mctrl_gpio: split disable_ms into sync and no_sync APIs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: mctrl_gpio: split disable_ms into sync and no_sync APIs

The following splat has been observed on a SAMA5D27 platform using
atmel_serial:

This warning is emitted when trying to toggle, at the highest level,
some flow control (with serdev_device_set_flow_control) in a device
driver. At the lowest level, the atmel_serial driver is using
serial_mctrl_gpio lib to enable/disable the corresponding IRQs
accordingly.  The warning emitted by CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is due to
disable_irq (called in mctrl_gpio_disable_ms) being possibly called in
some atomic context (some tty drivers perform modem lines configuration
in regions protected by port lock).

Split mctrl_gpio_disable_ms into two differents APIs, a non-blocking one
and a blocking one. Replace mctrl_gpio_disable_ms calls with the
relevant version depending on whether the call is protected by some port
lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38040 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
