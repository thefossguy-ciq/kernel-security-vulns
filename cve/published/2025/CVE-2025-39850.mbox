Subject: CVE-2025-39850: vxlan: Fix NPD in {arp,neigh}_reduce() when using nexthop objects

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vxlan: Fix NPD in {arp,neigh}_reduce() when using nexthop objects

When the "proxy" option is enabled on a VXLAN device, the device will
suppress ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages if it is
able to reply on behalf of the remote host. That is, if a matching and
valid neighbor entry is configured on the VXLAN device whose MAC address
is not behind the "any" remote (0.0.0.0 / ::).

The code currently assumes that the FDB entry for the neighbor's MAC
address points to a valid remote destination, but this is incorrect if
the entry is associated with an FDB nexthop group. This can result in a
NPD [1][3] which can be reproduced using [2][4].

Fix by checking that the remote destination exists before dereferencing
it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
