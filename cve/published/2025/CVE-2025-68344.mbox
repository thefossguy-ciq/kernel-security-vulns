Subject: CVE-2025-68344: ALSA: wavefront: Fix integer overflow in sample size validation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: wavefront: Fix integer overflow in sample size validation

The wavefront_send_sample() function has an integer overflow issue
when validating sample size. The header->size field is u32 but gets
cast to int for comparison with dev->freemem

Fix by using unsigned comparison to avoid integer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68344 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
