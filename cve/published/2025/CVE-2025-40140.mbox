Subject: CVE-2025-40140: net: usb: Remove disruptive netif_wake_queue in rtl8150_set_multicast

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: Remove disruptive netif_wake_queue in rtl8150_set_multicast

syzbot reported WARNING in rtl8150_start_xmit/usb_submit_urb.
This is the sequence of events that leads to the warning:

rtl8150_start_xmit() {
	netif_stop_queue();
	usb_submit_urb(dev->tx_urb);
}

rtl8150_set_multicast() {
	netif_stop_queue();
	netif_wake_queue();		<-- wakes up TX queue before URB is done
}

rtl8150_start_xmit() {
	netif_stop_queue();
	usb_submit_urb(dev->tx_urb);	<-- double submission
}

rtl8150_set_multicast being the ndo_set_rx_mode callback should not be
calling netif_stop_queue and notif_start_queue as these handle
TX queue synchronization.

The net core function dev_set_rx_mode handles the synchronization
for rtl8150_set_multicast making it safe to remove these locks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40140 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
