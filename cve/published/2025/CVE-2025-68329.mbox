Subject: CVE-2025-68329: tracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel
calls vm_ops->close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this
results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent
VMA splits entirely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68329 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
