Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: zynqmp-ipi: Fix out-of-bounds access in mailbox cleanup loop

The cleanup loop was starting at the wrong array index, causing
out-of-bounds access.
Start the loop at the correct index for zero-indexed arrays to prevent
accessing memory beyond the allocated array bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40180 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
