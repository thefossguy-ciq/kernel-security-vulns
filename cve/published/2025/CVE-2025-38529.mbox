Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: aio_iiro_16: Fix bit shift out of bounds

When checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:

	if ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {

However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so
the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by
requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with
the original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ
will be in the range [1,15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use of
interrupts.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38529 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
