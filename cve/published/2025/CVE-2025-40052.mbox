Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix crypto buffers in non-linear memory

The crypto API, through the scatterlist API, expects input buffers to be
in linear memory.  We handle this with the cifs_sg_set_buf() helper
that converts vmalloc'd memory to their corresponding pages.

However, when we allocate our aead_request buffer (@creq in
smb2ops.c::crypt_message()), we do so with kvzalloc(), which possibly
puts aead_request->__ctx in vmalloc area.

AEAD algorithm then uses ->__ctx for its private/internal data and
operations, and uses sg_set_buf() for such data on a few places.

This works fine as long as @creq falls into kmalloc zone (small
requests) or vmalloc'd memory is still within linear range.

Tasks' stacks are vmalloc'd by default (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y), so too
many tasks will increment the base stacks' addresses to a point where
virt_addr_valid(buf) will fail (BUG() in sg_set_buf()) when that
happens.

In practice: too many parallel reads and writes on an encrypted mount
will trigger this bug.

To fix this, always alloc @creq with kmalloc() instead.
Also drop the @sensitive_size variable/arguments since
kfree_sensitive() doesn't need it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
