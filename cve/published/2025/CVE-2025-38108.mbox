Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: red: fix a race in __red_change()

Gerrard Tai reported a race condition in RED, whenever SFQ perturb timer
fires at the wrong time.

The race is as follows:

CPU 0                                 CPU 1
[1]: lock root
[2]: qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()
[3]: unlock root
 |
 |                                    [5]: lock root
 |                                    [6]: rehash
 |                                    [7]: qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()
 |
[4]: qdisc_put()

This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen.

Calling qdisc_purge_queue() instead of qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()
should fix the race, because all packets will be purged from the qdisc
before releasing the lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
