Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix possible null-ptr-deref when initing hw

Search result of avs_dai_find_path_template() shall be verified before
being used. As 'template' is already known when
avs_hw_constraints_init() is fired, drop the search entirely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38308 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea218ae05e60616531fe652650b98dcd3c328279
