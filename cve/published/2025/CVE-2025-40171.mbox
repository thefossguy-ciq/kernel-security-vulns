Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-fc: move lsop put work to nvmet_fc_ls_req_op

It’s possible for more than one async command to be in flight from
__nvmet_fc_send_ls_req. For each command, a tgtport reference is taken.

In the current code, only one put work item is queued at a time, which
results in a leaked reference.

To fix this, move the work item to the nvmet_fc_ls_req_op struct, which
already tracks all resources related to the command.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40171 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
