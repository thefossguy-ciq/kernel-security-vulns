Subject: CVE-2025-38116: wifi: ath12k: fix uaf in ath12k_core_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix uaf in ath12k_core_init()

When the execution of ath12k_core_hw_group_assign() or
ath12k_core_hw_group_create() fails, the registered notifier chain is not
unregistered properly. Its memory is freed after rmmod, which may trigger
to a use-after-free (UAF) issue if there is a subsequent access to this
notifier chain.

Fixes the issue by calling ath12k_core_panic_notifier_unregister() in
failure cases.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65e1b3404c211dcfaea02698539cdcd26647130f
