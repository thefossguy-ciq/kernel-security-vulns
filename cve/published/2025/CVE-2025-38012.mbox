Subject: CVE-2025-38012: sched_ext: bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() should always initialize iterator

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() should always initialize iterator

BPF programs may call next() and destroy() on BPF iterators even after new()
returns an error value (e.g. bpf_for_each() macro ignores error returns from
new()). bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() could leave the iterator in an uninitialized
state after an error return causing bpf_iter_scx_dsq_next() to dereference
garbage data. Make bpf_iter_scx_dsq_new() always clear $kit->dsq so that
next() and destroy() become noops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38012 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0102989af4c334d1d98b2a0fd4d61a5152e39b72
