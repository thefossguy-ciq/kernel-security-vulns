Subject: CVE-2025-40333: f2fs: fix infinite loop in __insert_extent_tree()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix infinite loop in __insert_extent_tree()

When we get wrong extent info data, and look up extent_node in rb tree,
it will cause infinite loop (CONFIG_F2FS_CHECK_FS=n). Avoiding this by
return NULL and print some kernel messages in that case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40333 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
