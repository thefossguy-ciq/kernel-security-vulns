Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: nci: uart: Set tty->disc_data only in success path

Setting tty->disc_data before opening the NCI device means we need to
clean it up on error paths.  This also opens some short window if device
starts sending data, even before NCIUARTSETDRIVER IOCTL succeeded
(broken hardware?).  Close the window by exposing tty->disc_data only on
the success path, when opening of the NCI device and try_module_get()
succeeds.

The code differs in error path in one aspect: tty->disc_data won't be
ever assigned thus NULL-ified.  This however should not be relevant
difference, because of "tty->disc_data=NULL" in nci_uart_tty_open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38416 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
