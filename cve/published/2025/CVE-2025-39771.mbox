Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: pca9450: Use devm_register_sys_off_handler

With module test, there is error dump:
------------[ cut here ]------------
  notifier callback pca9450_i2c_restart_handler already registered
  WARNING: kernel/notifier.c:23 at notifier_chain_register+0x5c/0x88,
  CPU#0: kworker/u16:3/50
  Call trace:
  notifier_chain_register+0x5c/0x88 (P)
  atomic_notifier_chain_register+0x30/0x58
  register_restart_handler+0x1c/0x28

  __driver_probe_device+0xa0/0x150
  driver_probe_device+0x40/0x114
  __device_attach_driver+0xd4/0x12c

So use devm_register_sys_off_handler to let kernel handle the resource
free to avoid kernel dump.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39771 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a8c8aa0b0b2c62a0232bf868def85f3069ba7a7
