Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: fix an integer overflow in xp_create_and_assign_umem()

Since the i and pool->chunk_size variables are of type 'u32',
their product can wrap around and then be cast to 'u64'.
This can lead to two different XDP buffers pointing to the same
memory area.

Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center
(linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
