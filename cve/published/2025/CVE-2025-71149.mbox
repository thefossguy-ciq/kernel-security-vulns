Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/poll: correctly handle io_poll_add() return value on update

When the core of io_uring was updated to handle completions
consistently and with fixed return codes, the POLL_REMOVE opcode
with updates got slightly broken. If a POLL_ADD is pending and
then POLL_REMOVE is used to update the events of that request, if that
update causes the POLL_ADD to now trigger, then that completion is lost
and a CQE is never posted.

Additionally, ensure that if an update does cause an existing POLL_ADD
to complete, that the completion value isn't always overwritten with
-ECANCELED. For that case, whatever io_poll_add() set the value to
should just be retained.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71149 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
