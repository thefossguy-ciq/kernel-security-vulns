Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Delay module unload while fabric scan in progress

System crash seen during load/unload test in a loop.

The root cause of this was that there was a free (dma_free_attrs) in the
interrupt context.  There was a device discovery/fabric scan in
progress.  A module unload was issued which set the UNLOADING flag.  As
part of the discovery, after receiving an interrupt a work queue was
scheduled (which involved a work to be queued).  Since the UNLOADING
flag is set, the work item was not allocated and the mapped memory had
to be freed.  The free occurred in interrupt context leading to system
crash.  Delay the driver unload until the fabric scan is complete to
avoid the crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71235 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
