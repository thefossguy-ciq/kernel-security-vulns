Subject: CVE-2025-40198: ext4: avoid potential buffer over-read in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid potential buffer over-read in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()

Unlike other strings in the ext4 superblock, we rely on tune2fs to
make sure s_mount_opts is NUL terminated.  Harden
parse_apply_sb_mount_options() by treating s_mount_opts as a potential
__nonstring.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40198 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
