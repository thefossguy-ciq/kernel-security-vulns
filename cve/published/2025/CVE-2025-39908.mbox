Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dev_ioctl: take ops lock in hwtstamp lower paths

ndo hwtstamp callbacks are expected to run under the per-device ops
lock. Make the lower get/set paths consistent with the rest of ndo
invocations.

Kernel log:

Note that the mlx5_hwtstamp_set and mlx5e_hwtstamp_set functions shown
in the trace come from an in progress patch converting the legacy ioctl
to ndo_hwtstamp_get/set and are not present in mainline.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39908 to this issue.

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/core/dev_ioctl.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d92fa0cdc02291de57f72170e8b60cef0cf5372
