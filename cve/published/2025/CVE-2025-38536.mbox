Subject: CVE-2025-38536: net: airoha: fix potential use-after-free in airoha_npu_get()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: airoha: fix potential use-after-free in airoha_npu_get()

np->name was being used after calling of_node_put(np), which
releases the node and can lead to a use-after-free bug.
Previously, of_node_put(np) was called unconditionally after
of_find_device_by_node(np), which could result in a use-after-free if
pdev is NULL.

This patch moves of_node_put(np) after the error check to ensure
the node is only released after both the error and success cases
are handled appropriately, preventing potential resource issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38536 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
