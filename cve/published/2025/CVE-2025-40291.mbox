Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix regbuf vector size truncation

There is a report of io_estimate_bvec_size() truncating the calculated
number of segments that leads to corruption issues. Check it doesn't
overflow "int"s used later. Rough but simple, can be improved on top.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
