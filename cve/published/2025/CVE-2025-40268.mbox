Subject: CVE-2025-40268: cifs: client: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: client: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param

The user calls fsconfig twice, but when the program exits, free() only
frees ctx->source for the second fsconfig, not the first.
Regarding fc->source, there is no code in the fs context related to its
memory reclamation.

To fix this memory leak, release the source memory corresponding to ctx
or fc before each parsing.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
