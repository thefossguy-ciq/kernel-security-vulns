Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: bugfix live migration function without VF device driver

If the VF device driver is not loaded in the Guest OS and we attempt to
perform device data migration, the address of the migrated data will
be NULL.
The live migration recovery operation on the destination side will
access a null address value, which will cause access errors.

Therefore, live migration of VMs without added VF device drivers
does not require device data migration.
In addition, when the queue address data obtained by the destination
is empty, device queue recovery processing will not be performed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38283 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
