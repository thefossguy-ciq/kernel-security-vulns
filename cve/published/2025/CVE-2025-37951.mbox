Subject: CVE-2025-37951: drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped

When a CL/CSD job times out, we check if the GPU has made any progress
since the last timeout. If so, instead of resetting the hardware, we skip
the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a
chance to complete.

However, when `timedout_job()` is called, the job in question is removed
from the pending list, which means it won't be automatically freed through
`free_job()`. Consequently, when we skip the reset and keep the job
running, the job won't be freed when it finally completes.

This situation leads to a memory leak, as exposed in [1] and [2].

Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 ("drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler when
GPU is still active"), this patch ensures the job is put back on the
pending list when extending the timeout.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37951 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
