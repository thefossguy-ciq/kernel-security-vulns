Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: Fix possible NPD in fec_enet_phy_reset_after_clk_enable()

The function of_phy_find_device may return NULL, so we need to take
care before dereferencing phy_dev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39876 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
