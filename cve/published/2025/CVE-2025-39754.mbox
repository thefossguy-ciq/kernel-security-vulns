Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/smaps: fix race between smaps_hugetlb_range and migration

smaps_hugetlb_range() handles the pte without holdling ptl, and may be
concurrenct with migration, leaing to BUG_ON in pfn_swap_entry_to_page(). 
The race is as follows.

smaps_hugetlb_range              migrate_pages
  huge_ptep_get
                                   remove_migration_ptes
				   folio_unlock
  pfn_swap_entry_folio
    BUG_ON

To fix it, hold ptl lock in smaps_hugetlb_range().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39754 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
