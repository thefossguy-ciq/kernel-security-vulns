Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/cpu: Avoid running off the end of an AMD erratum table

The NULL array terminator at the end of erratum_1386_microcode was
removed during the switch from x86_cpu_desc to x86_cpu_id. This
causes readers to run off the end of the array.

Replace the NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37751 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b518f73f1b6f59e083ec33dea22d9a1a275a970
