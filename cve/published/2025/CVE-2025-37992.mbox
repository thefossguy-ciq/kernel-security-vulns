Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during ->change()

Previously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the ->change() operation, only
the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb
list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check
sch->limit against sch->q.qlen.

This patch introduces a new helper, qdisc_dequeue_internal(), which ensures
both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming
excess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel, fq, fq_codel, fq_pie, hhf, pie)
are updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37992 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
