Subject: CVE-2025-38440: net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()

There's a race between disabling DIM and NAPI callbacks using the dim
pointer on the RQ or SQ.

If NAPI checks the DIM state bit and sees it still set, it assumes
`rq->dim` or `sq->dim` is valid. But if DIM gets disabled right after
that check, the pointer might already be set to NULL, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference in net_dim().

Fix this by calling `synchronize_net()` before freeing the DIM context.
This ensures all in-progress NAPI callbacks are finished before the
pointer is cleared.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7581afc051542e11ccf3ade68acd01b7fb1a3cde
