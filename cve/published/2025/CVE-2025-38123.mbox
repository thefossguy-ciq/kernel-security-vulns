Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: t7xx: Fix napi rx poll issue

When driver handles the napi rx polling requests, the netdev might
have been released by the dellink logic triggered by the disconnect
operation on user plane. However, in the logic of processing skb in
polling, an invalid netdev is still being used, which causes a panic.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
