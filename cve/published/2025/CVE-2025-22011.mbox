Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: dts: bcm2711: Fix xHCI power-domain

During s2idle tests on the Raspberry CM4 the VPU firmware always crashes
on xHCI power-domain resume:

root@raspberrypi:/sys/power# echo freeze > state
[   70.724347] xhci_suspend finished
[   70.727730] xhci_plat_suspend finished
[   70.755624] bcm2835-power bcm2835-power: Power grafx off
[   70.761127]  USB: Set power to 0

[   74.653040]  USB: Failed to set power to 1 (-110)

This seems to be caused because of the mixed usage of
raspberrypi-power and bcm2835-power at the same time. So avoid
the usage of the VPU firmware power-domain driver, which
prevents the VPU crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22011 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
