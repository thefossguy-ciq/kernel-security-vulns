Subject: CVE-2025-68247: posix-timers: Plug potential memory leak in do_timer_create()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-timers: Plug potential memory leak in do_timer_create()

When posix timer creation is set to allocate a given timer ID and the
access to the user space value faults, the function terminates without
freeing the already allocated posix timer structure.

Move the allocation after the user space access to cure that.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
