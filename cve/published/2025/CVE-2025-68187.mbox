Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mdio: Check regmap pointer returned by device_node_to_regmap()

The call to device_node_to_regmap() in airoha_mdio_probe() can return
an ERR_PTR() if regmap initialization fails. Currently, the driver
stores the pointer without validation, which could lead to a crash
if it is later dereferenced.

Add an IS_ERR() check and return the corresponding error code to make
the probe path more robust.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68187 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc8ed3823473bb38ba43cfb34f1e1c1baa22f975
