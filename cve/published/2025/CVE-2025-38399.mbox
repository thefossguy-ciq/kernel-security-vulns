Subject: CVE-2025-38399: scsi: target: Fix NULL pointer dereference in core_scsi3_decode_spec_i_port()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: Fix NULL pointer dereference in core_scsi3_decode_spec_i_port()

The function core_scsi3_decode_spec_i_port(), in its error code path,
unconditionally calls core_scsi3_lunacl_undepend_item() passing the
dest_se_deve pointer, which may be NULL.

This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if dest_se_deve remains
unset.

SPC-3 PR SPEC_I_PT: Unable to locate dest_tpg
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address dfff800000000012
Call trace:
  core_scsi3_lunacl_undepend_item+0x2c/0xf0 [target_core_mod] (P)
  core_scsi3_decode_spec_i_port+0x120c/0x1c30 [target_core_mod]
  core_scsi3_emulate_pro_register+0x6b8/0xcd8 [target_core_mod]
  target_scsi3_emulate_pr_out+0x56c/0x840 [target_core_mod]

Fix this by adding a NULL check before calling
core_scsi3_lunacl_undepend_item()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38399 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
