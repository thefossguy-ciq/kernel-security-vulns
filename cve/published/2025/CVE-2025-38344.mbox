Subject: CVE-2025-38344: ACPICA: fix acpi parse and parseext cache leaks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: fix acpi parse and parseext cache leaks

ACPICA commit 8829e70e1360c81e7a5a901b5d4f48330e021ea5

I'm Seunghun Han, and I work for National Security Research Institute of
South Korea.

I have been doing a research on ACPI and found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI
early abort cases.

Boot log of ACPI cache leak is as follows:
[    0.352414] ACPI: Added _OSI(Module Device)

I analyzed this memory leak in detail. I found that “Acpi-State” cache and
“Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same
slab cache size.

I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked
using SLAB_NEVER_MERGE flag in kmem_cache_create() function.

Real ACPI cache leak point is as follows:

When early abort is occurred due to invalid ACPI information, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI by calling acpi_terminate() function. The function calls
acpi_ut_delete_caches() function to delete local caches (acpi_gbl_namespace_
cache, state_cache, operand_cache, ps_node_cache, ps_node_ext_cache).

But the deletion codes in acpi_ut_delete_caches() function only delete
slab caches using kmem_cache_destroy() function, therefore the cache
objects should be flushed before acpi_ut_delete_caches() function.

"Acpi-Parse" cache and "Acpi-ParseExt" cache are used in an AML parse
function, acpi_ps_parse_loop(). The function should complete all ops
using acpi_ps_complete_final_op() when an error occurs due to invalid
AML codes.
However, the current implementation of acpi_ps_complete_final_op() does not
complete all ops when it meets some errors and this cause cache leak.

This cache leak has a security threat because an old kernel (<= 4.9) shows
memory locations of kernel functions in stack dump. Some malicious users
could use this information to neutralize kernel ASLR.

To fix ACPI cache leak for enhancing security, I made a patch to complete all
ops unconditionally for acpi_ps_complete_final_op() function.

I hope that this patch improves the security of Linux kernel.

Thank you.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38344 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
