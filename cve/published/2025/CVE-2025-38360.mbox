Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add more checks for DSC / HUBP ONO guarantees

[WHY]
For non-zero DSC instances it's possible that the HUBP domain required
to drive it for sequential ONO ASICs isn't met, potentially causing
the logic to the tile to enter an undefined state leading to a system
hang.

[HOW]
Add more checks to ensure that the HUBP domain matching the DSC instance
is appropriately powered.

(cherry picked from commit da63df07112e5a9857a8d2aaa04255c4206754ec)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38360 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/646442758910d13f9afc57f38bc0a537c3575390
