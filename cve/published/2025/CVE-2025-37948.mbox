Subject: CVE-2025-37948: arm64: bpf: Add BHB mitigation to the epilogue for cBPF programs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: bpf: Add BHB mitigation to the epilogue for cBPF programs

A malicious BPF program may manipulate the branch history to influence
what the hardware speculates will happen next.

On exit from a BPF program, emit the BHB mititgation sequence.

This is only applied for 'classic' cBPF programs that are loaded by
seccomp.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37948 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
