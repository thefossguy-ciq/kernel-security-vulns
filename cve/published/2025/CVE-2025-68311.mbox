Subject: CVE-2025-68311: tty: serial: ip22zilog: Use platform device for probing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: ip22zilog: Use platform device for probing

After commit 84a9582fd203 ("serial: core: Start managing serial controllers
to enable runtime PM") serial drivers need to provide a device in
struct uart_port.dev otherwise an oops happens. To fix this issue
for ip22zilog driver switch driver to a platform driver and setup
the serial device in sgi-ip22 code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68311 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
