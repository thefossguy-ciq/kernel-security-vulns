Subject: CVE-2025-38149: net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the "error" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

[   24.702421] Call trace:
[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120
[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48
[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168
[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4
[   24.720352]  phylink_fwnode_phy_connect+0xc8/0x14c
[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34

Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is
deleted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38149 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
