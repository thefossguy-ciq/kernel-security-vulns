Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()

[dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through -
up to xen folks]

As soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another
thread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is
returning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland
race and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we
follow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be
destroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed
by its ->release()), we have a UAF.

dma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().
gntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the
objects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.

Fix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do
fd_install() only when everything had been set up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38595 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
