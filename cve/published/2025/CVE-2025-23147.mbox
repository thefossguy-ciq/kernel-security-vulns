Subject: CVE-2025-23147: i3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()

The I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not
been probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`
to queue an IBI work task, leading to "Unable to handle kernel read from
unreadable memory" and resulting in a kernel panic.

Typical IBI handling flow:
1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.
2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI
   and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`.
3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls
   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driverâ€™s IBI
   handler task.

However, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe
sequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`,
leading to a kernel panic.

Add a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing
an uninitialized `dev->ibi`, ensuring stability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
