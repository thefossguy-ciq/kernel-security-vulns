Subject: CVE-2025-68777: Input: ti_am335x_tsc - fix off-by-one error in wire_order validation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: ti_am335x_tsc - fix off-by-one error in wire_order validation

The current validation 'wire_order[i] > ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins)' allows
wire_order[i] to equal ARRAY_SIZE(config_pins), which causes out-of-bounds
access when used as index in 'config_pins[wire_order[i]]'.

Since config_pins has 4 elements (indices 0-3), the valid range for
wire_order should be 0-3. Fix the off-by-one error by using >= instead
of > in the validation check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
