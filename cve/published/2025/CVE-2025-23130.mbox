Subject: CVE-2025-23130: f2fs: fix to avoid panic once fallocation fails for pinfile

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid panic once fallocation fails for pinfile

syzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:

Concurrent pinfile allocation may run out of free section, result in
panic in get_new_segment(), let's expand pin_sem lock coverage to
include f2fs_gc(), so that we can make sure to reclaim enough free
space for following allocation.

In addition, do below changes to enhance error path handling:
- call f2fs_bug_on() only in non-pinfile allocation path in
get_new_segment().
- call reset_curseg_fields() to reset all fields of curseg in
new_curseg()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9392862608d081a8346a3b841f862d732fce954b
