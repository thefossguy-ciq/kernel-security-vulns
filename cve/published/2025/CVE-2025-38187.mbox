Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: fix a use-after-free in r535_gsp_rpc_push()

The RPC container is released after being passed to r535_gsp_rpc_send().

When sending the initial fragment of a large RPC and passing the
caller's RPC container, the container will be freed prematurely. Subsequent
attempts to send remaining fragments will therefore result in a
use-after-free.

Allocate a temporary RPC container for holding the initial fragment of a
large RPC when sending. Free the caller's container when all fragments
are successfully sent.

[ Rebase onto Blackwell changes. - Danilo ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38187 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cd4677407c0ee250fc21e36439c8a442ddd62cc1
