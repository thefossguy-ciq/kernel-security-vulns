Subject: CVE-2025-37906: ublk: fix race between io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task and ublk_cancel_cmd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix race between io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task and ublk_cancel_cmd

ublk_cancel_cmd() calls io_uring_cmd_done() to complete uring_cmd, but
we may have scheduled task work via io_uring_cmd_complete_in_task() for
dispatching request, then kernel crash can be triggered.

Fix it by not trying to canceling the command if ublk block request is
started.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37906 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
