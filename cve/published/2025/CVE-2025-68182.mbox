Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix potential use after free in iwl_mld_remove_link()

This code frees "link" by calling kfree_rcu(link, rcu_head) and then it
dereferences "link" to get the "link->fw_id".  Save the "link->fw_id"
first to avoid a potential use after free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68182 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5b4a239c9f94e1606435f1842fc6fd426d607dbb
