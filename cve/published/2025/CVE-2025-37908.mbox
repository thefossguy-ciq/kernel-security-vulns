Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, slab: clean up slab->obj_exts always

When memory allocation profiling is disabled at runtime or due to an
error, shutdown_mem_profiling() is called: slab->obj_exts which
previously allocated remains.
It won't be cleared by unaccount_slab() because of
mem_alloc_profiling_enabled() not true. It's incorrect, slab->obj_exts
should always be cleaned up in unaccount_slab() to avoid following error:

[...]BUG: Bad page state in process...
..
[...]page dumped because: page still charged to cgroup

[andriy.shevchenko@linux.intel.com: fold need_slab_obj_ext() into its only user]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37908 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
