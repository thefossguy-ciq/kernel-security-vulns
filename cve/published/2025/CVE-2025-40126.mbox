Subject: CVE-2025-40126: sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC

The referenced commit introduced exception handlers on user-space memory
references in copy_from_user and copy_to_user. These handlers return from
the respective function and calculate the remaining bytes left to copy
using the current register contents. This commit fixes a couple of bad
calculations. This will fix the return value of copy_from_user and
copy_to_user in the faulting case. The behaviour of memcpy stays unchanged.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40126 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
