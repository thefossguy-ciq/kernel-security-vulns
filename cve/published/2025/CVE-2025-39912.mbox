Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfs/localio: restore creds before releasing pageio data

Otherwise if the nfsd filecache code releases the nfsd_file
immediately, it can trigger the BUG_ON(cred == current->cred) in
__put_cred() when it puts the nfsd_file->nf_file->f-cred.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39912 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
