Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: take paired job reference

For paired jobs, have the fragment job take a reference on the
geometry job, so that the geometry job cannot be freed until
the fragment job has finished with it.

The geometry job structure is accessed when the fragment job is being
prepared by the GPU scheduler. Taking the reference prevents the
geometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.

Fixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:

[  124.256386] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pvr_queue_prepare_job+0x108/0x868 [powervr]
[  124.264893] Read of size 1 at addr ffff0000084cb960 by task kworker/u16:4/63

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37763 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c90b95e12eb88d23740e5ea2c43d71675d17ac8d
