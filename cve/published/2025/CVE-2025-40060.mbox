Subject: CVE-2025-40060: coresight: trbe: Return NULL pointer for allocation failures

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

coresight: trbe: Return NULL pointer for allocation failures

When the TRBE driver fails to allocate a buffer, it currently returns
the error code "-ENOMEM". However, the caller etm_setup_aux() only
checks for a NULL pointer, so it misses the error. As a result, the
driver continues and eventually causes a kernel panic.

Fix this by returning a NULL pointer from arm_trbe_alloc_buffer() on
allocation failures. This allows that the callers can properly handle
the failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40060 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
