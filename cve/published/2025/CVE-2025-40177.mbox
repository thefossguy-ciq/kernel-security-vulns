Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: Fix bootlog initialization ordering

As soon as we queue MHI buffers to receive the bootlog from the device,
we could be receiving data. Therefore all the resources needed to
process that data need to be setup prior to queuing the buffers.

We currently initialize some of the resources after queuing the buffers
which creates a race between the probe() and any data that comes back
from the device. If the uninitialized resources are accessed, we could
see page faults.

Fix the init ordering to close the race.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40177 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/646868e6962b14e25ae7462fdd1fb061b40c1f16
