Subject: CVE-2025-38335: Input: gpio-keys - fix a sleep while atomic with PREEMPT_RT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: gpio-keys - fix a sleep while atomic with PREEMPT_RT

When enabling PREEMPT_RT, the gpio_keys_irq_timer() callback runs in
hard irq context, but the input_event() takes a spin_lock, which isn't
allowed there as it is converted to a rt_spin_lock().

[ 4054.289999] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
[ 4054.290028] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 0, name: swapper/0

Considering the gpio_keys_irq_isr() can run in any context, e.g. it can
be threaded, it seems there's no point in requesting the timer isr to
run in hard irq context.

Relax the hrtimer not to use the hard context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38335 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec8f5da79b425deef5aebacdd4fe645620cd4f0b
