Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: don't use submit_bio_noacct_nocheck in blk_zone_wplug_bio_work

Bios queued up in the zone write plug have already gone through all all
preparation in the submit_bio path, including the freeze protection.

Submitting them through submit_bio_noacct_nocheck duplicates the work
and can can cause deadlocks when freezing a queue with pending bio
write plugs.

Go straight to ->submit_bio or blk_mq_submit_bio to bypass the
superfluous extra freeze protection and checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38302 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
