Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: HWS, fix definer's HWS_SET32 macro for negative offset

When bit offset for HWS_SET32 macro is negative,
UBSAN complains about the shift-out-of-bounds:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in
  drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/steering/hws/definer.c:177:2
  shift exponent -8 is negative

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21800 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92cff996624c4757d5bbace3dfa3f1567ba94143
