Subject: CVE-2025-38469: KVM: x86/xen: Fix cleanup logic in emulation of Xen schedop poll hypercalls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/xen: Fix cleanup logic in emulation of Xen schedop poll hypercalls

kvm_xen_schedop_poll does a kmalloc_array() when a VM polls the host
for more than one event channel potr (nr_ports > 1).

After the kmalloc_array(), the error paths need to go through the
"out" label, but the call to kvm_read_guest_virt() does not.

[Adjusted commit message. - Paolo]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38469 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
