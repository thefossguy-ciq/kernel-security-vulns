In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fsl-edma: free irq correctly in remove path

Add fsl_edma->txirq/errirq check to avoid below warning because no
errirq at i.MX9 platform. Otherwise there will be kernel dump:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
