Subject: CVE-2025-38271: net: prevent a NULL deref in rtnl_create_link()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: prevent a NULL deref in rtnl_create_link()

At the time rtnl_create_link() is running, dev->netdev_ops is NULL,
we must not use netdev_lock_ops() or risk a NULL deref if
CONFIG_NET_SHAPER is defined.

Use netif_set_group() instead of dev_set_group().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a29ae8428a5c26f0b4471c2057d9e9415c53109
