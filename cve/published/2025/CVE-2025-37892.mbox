Subject: CVE-2025-37892: mtd: inftlcore: Add error check for inftl_read_oob()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: inftlcore: Add error check for inftl_read_oob()

In INFTL_findwriteunit(), the return value of inftl_read_oob()
need to be checked. A proper implementation can be
found in INFTL_deleteblock(). The status will be set as
SECTOR_IGNORE to break from the while-loop correctly
if the inftl_read_oob() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37892 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
