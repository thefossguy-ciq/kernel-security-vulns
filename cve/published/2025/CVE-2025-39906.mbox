Subject: CVE-2025-39906: drm/amd/display: remove oem i2c adapter on finish

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: remove oem i2c adapter on finish

Fixes a bug where unbinding of the GPU would leave the oem i2c adapter
registered resulting in a null pointer dereference when applications try
to access the invalid device.

(cherry picked from commit 89923fb7ead4fdd37b78dd49962d9bb5892403e6)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
