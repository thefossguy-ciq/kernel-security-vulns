Subject: CVE-2025-38215: fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode, it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

================================================================

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
