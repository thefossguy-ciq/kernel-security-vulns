Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()

On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via
ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and
first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

(cherry picked from commit 2d52de55f9ee7aaee0e09ac443f77855989c6b68)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/78b07dada3f02f77762d0755a96d35f53b02be69
