Subject: CVE-2025-21985: drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT & HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21985 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
