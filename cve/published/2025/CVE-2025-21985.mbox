Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT & HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21985 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.20 with commit 36793d90d76f667d26c6dd025571481ee0c96abc

	Fixed in 6.14 with commit 8adbb2a98b00926315fd513b5fe2596b5716b82d

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-21985
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
