Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: stacktrace: Disable KASAN checks for non-current tasks

Unwinding the stack of a task other than current, KASAN would report
"BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in walk_stackframe+0x41c/0x460"

There is a same issue on x86 and has been resolved by the commit
84936118bdf3 ("x86/unwind: Disable KASAN checks for non-current tasks")
The solution could be applied to RISC-V too.

This patch also can solve the issue:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
