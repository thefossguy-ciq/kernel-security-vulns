Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: hugetlb: avoid soft lockup when mprotect to large memory area

When calling mprotect() to a large hugetlb memory area in our customer's
workload (~300GB hugetlb memory), soft lockup was observed:

watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#98 stuck for 23s! [t2_new_sysv:126916]

Soft lockup is not triggered with THP or base page because there is
cond_resched() called for each PMD size.

Although the soft lockup was triggered by MTE, it should be not MTE
specific.  The other processing which takes long time in the loop may
trigger soft lockup too.

So add cond_resched() for hugetlb to avoid soft lockup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
