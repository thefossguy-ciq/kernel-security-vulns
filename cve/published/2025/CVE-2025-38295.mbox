Subject: CVE-2025-38295: perf/amlogic: Replace smp_processor_id() with raw_smp_processor_id() in meson_ddr_pmu_create()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/amlogic: Replace smp_processor_id() with raw_smp_processor_id() in meson_ddr_pmu_create()

The Amlogic DDR PMU driver meson_ddr_pmu_create() function incorrectly uses
smp_processor_id(), which assumes disabled preemption. This leads to kernel
warnings during module loading because meson_ddr_pmu_create() can be called
in a preemptible context.

Following kernel warning and stack trace:

Changes replaces smp_processor_id() with raw_smp_processor_id() to
ensure safe CPU ID retrieval in preemptible contexts.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
