Subject: CVE-2025-40275: ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd

In snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface
Association Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this
call fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next
interface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()
assumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,
without performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.

This patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in
snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.

This issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending
a crafted USB device descriptor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40275 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
