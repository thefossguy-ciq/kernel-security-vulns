Subject: CVE-2025-71184: btrfs: fix NULL dereference on root when tracing inode eviction

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix NULL dereference on root when tracing inode eviction

When evicting an inode the first thing we do is to setup tracing for it,
which implies fetching the root's id. But in btrfs_evict_inode() the
root might be NULL, as implied in the next check that we do in
btrfs_evict_inode().

Hence, we either should set the ->root_objectid to 0 in case the root is
NULL, or we move tracing setup after checking that the root is not
NULL. Setting the rootid to 0 at least gives us the possibility to trace
this call even in the case when the root is NULL, so that's the solution
taken here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
