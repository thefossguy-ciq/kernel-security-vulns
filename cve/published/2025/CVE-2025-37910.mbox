Subject: CVE-2025-37910: ptp: ocp: Fix NULL dereference in Adva board SMA sysfs operations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: ocp: Fix NULL dereference in Adva board SMA sysfs operations

On Adva boards, SMA sysfs store/get operations can call
__handle_signal_outputs() or __handle_signal_inputs() while the `irig`
and `dcf` pointers are uninitialized, leading to a NULL pointer
dereference in __handle_signal() and causing a kernel crash. Adva boards
don't use `irig` or `dcf` functionality, so add Adva-specific callbacks
`ptp_ocp_sma_adva_set_outputs()` and `ptp_ocp_sma_adva_set_inputs()` that
avoid invoking `irig` or `dcf` input/output routines.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37910 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
