Subject: CVE-2025-38663: nilfs2: reject invalid file types when reading inodes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: reject invalid file types when reading inodes

To prevent inodes with invalid file types from tripping through the vfs
and causing malfunctions or assertion failures, add a missing sanity check
when reading an inode from a block device.  If the file type is not valid,
treat it as a filesystem error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38663 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
