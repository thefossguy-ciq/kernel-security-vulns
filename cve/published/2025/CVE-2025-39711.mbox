Subject: CVE-2025-39711: media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ivsc: Fix crash at shutdown due to missing mei_cldev_disable() calls

Both the ACE and CSI driver are missing a mei_cldev_disable() call in
their remove() function.

This causes the mei_cl client to stay part of the mei_device->file_list
list even though its memory is freed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() calling
kfree(cldev->cl).

This leads to a use-after-free when mei_vsc_remove() runs mei_stop()
which first removes all mei bus devices calling mei_ace_remove() and
mei_csi_remove() followed by mei_cl_bus_dev_release() and then calls
mei_cl_all_disconnect() which walks over mei_device->file_list dereferecing
the just freed cldev->cl.

And mei_vsc_remove() it self is run at shutdown because of the
platform_device_unregister(tp->pdev) in vsc_tp_shutdown()

When building a kernel with KASAN this leads to the following KASAN report:

Add the missing mei_cldev_disable() calls so that the mei_cl gets removed
from mei_device->file_list before it is freed to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
