Subject: CVE-2025-68737: arm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/pageattr: Propagate return value from __change_memory_common

The rodata=on security measure requires that any code path which does
vmalloc -> set_memory_ro/set_memory_rox must protect the linear map alias
too. Therefore, if such a call fails, we must abort set_memory_* and caller
must take appropriate action; currently we are suppressing the error, and
there is a real chance of such an error arising post commit a166563e7ec3
("arm64: mm: support large block mapping when rodata=full"). Therefore,
propagate any error to the caller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68737 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/arm64/mm/pageattr.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
