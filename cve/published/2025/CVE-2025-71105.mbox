Subject: CVE-2025-71105: f2fs: use global inline_xattr_slab instead of per-sb slab cache

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: use global inline_xattr_slab instead of per-sb slab cache

As Hong Yun reported in mailing list:

loop7: detected capacity change from 0 to 131072

The bug can be reproduced w/ below scripts:
- mount /dev/vdb /mnt1
- mount /dev/vdc /mnt2
- umount /mnt1
- mounnt /dev/vdb /mnt1

The reason is if we created two slab caches, named f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3
and f2fs_xattr_entry-7:7, and they have the same slab size. Actually,
slab system will only create one slab cache core structure which has
slab name of "f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3", and two slab caches share the same
structure and cache address.

So, if we destroy f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3 cache w/ cache address, it will
decrease reference count of slab cache, rather than release slab cache
entirely, since there is one more user has referenced the cache.

Then, if we try to create slab cache w/ name "f2fs_xattr_entry-7:3" again,
slab system will find that there is existed cache which has the same name
and trigger the warning.

Let's changes to use global inline_xattr_slab instead of per-sb slab cache
for fixing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71105 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
