Subject: CVE-2025-37833: net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads

Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.

Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to
work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.

For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal
trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries'
ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other
registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value
does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up,
so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the
trap.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
