Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: sme: cap SSID length in __cfg80211_connect_result()

If the ssid->datalen is more than IEEE80211_MAX_SSID_LEN (32) it would
lead to memory corruption so add some bounds checking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
