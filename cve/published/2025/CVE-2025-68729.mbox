Subject: CVE-2025-68729: wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix MSDU buffer types handling in RX error path

Currently, packets received on the REO exception ring from
unassociated peers are of MSDU buffer type, while the driver expects
link descriptor type packets. These packets are not parsed further due
to a return check on packet type in ath12k_hal_desc_reo_parse_err(),
but the associated skb is not freed. This may lead to kernel
crashes and buffer leaks.

Hence to fix, update the RX error handler to explicitly drop
MSDU buffer type packets received on the REO exception ring.
This prevents further processing of invalid packets and ensures
stability in the RX error handling path.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.4.1-00199-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68729 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
