Subject: CVE-2025-39823: KVM: x86: use array_index_nospec with indices that come from guest

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: use array_index_nospec with indices that come from guest

min and dest_id are guest-controlled indices. Using array_index_nospec()
after the bounds checks clamps these values to mitigate speculative execution
side-channels.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39823 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
