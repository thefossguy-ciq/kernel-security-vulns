Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix null pointer dereference in bnxt_bs_trace_check_wrap()

With older FW, we may get the ASYNC_EVENT_CMPL_EVENT_ID_DBG_BUF_PRODUCER
for FW trace data type that has not been initialized.  This will result
in a crash in bnxt_bs_trace_type_wrap().  Add a guard to check for a
valid magic_byte pointer before proceeding.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/689ae5ba31293eebb7f21c0ef8939468ac72b5ce
