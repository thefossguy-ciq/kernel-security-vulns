Subject: CVE-2025-38148: net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping

Fix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When running
one-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX time
into the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As in
this case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the frame
was timestamped, then the frame will never released.
Fix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38148 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
