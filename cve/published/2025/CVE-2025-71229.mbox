Subject: CVE-2025-71229: wifi: rtw88: Fix alignment fault in rtw_core_enable_beacon()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: Fix alignment fault in rtw_core_enable_beacon()

rtw_core_enable_beacon() reads 4 bytes from an address that is not a
multiple of 4. This results in a crash on some systems.

Do 1 byte reads/writes instead.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
