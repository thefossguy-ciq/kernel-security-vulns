Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: stmm: Fix incorrect buffer allocation method

The communication buffer allocated by setup_mm_hdr() is later on passed
to tee_shm_register_kernel_buf(). The latter expects those buffers to be
contiguous pages, but setup_mm_hdr() just uses kmalloc(). That can cause
various corruptions or BUGs, specifically since commit 9aec2fb0fd5e
("slab: allocate frozen pages"), though it was broken before as well.

Fix this by using alloc_pages_exact() instead of kmalloc().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39836 to this issue.

	drivers/firmware/efi/stmm/tee_stmm_efi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77ff27ff0e4529a003c8a1c2492c111968c378d3
