Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd: pmf: Use device managed allocations

If setting up smart PC fails for any reason then this can lead to
a double free when unloading amd-pmf.  This is because dev->buf was
freed but never set to NULL and is again freed in amd_pmf_remove().

To avoid subtle allocation bugs in failures leading to a double free
change all allocations into device managed allocations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38421 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d10b532f861253c283863522d59d099fcb0796d
