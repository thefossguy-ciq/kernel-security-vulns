Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/eventpoll: fix endless busy loop after timeout has expired

After commit 0a65bc27bd64 ("eventpoll: Set epoll timeout if it's in
the future"), the following program would immediately enter a busy
loop in the kernel:

```
int main() {
  int e = epoll_create1(0);
  struct epoll_event event = {.events = EPOLLIN};
  epoll_ctl(e, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, 0, &event);
  const struct timespec timeout = {.tv_nsec = 1};
  epoll_pwait2(e, &event, 1, &timeout, 0);
}
```

This happens because the given (non-zero) timeout of 1 nanosecond
usually expires before ep_poll() is entered and then
ep_schedule_timeout() returns false, but `timed_out` is never set
because the code line that sets it is skipped.  This quickly turns
into a soft lockup, RCU stalls and deadlocks, inflicting severe
headaches to the whole system.

When the timeout has expired, we don't need to schedule a hrtimer, but
we should set the `timed_out` variable.  Therefore, I suggest moving
the ep_schedule_timeout() check into the `timed_out` expression
instead of skipping it.

brauner: Note that there was an earlier fix by Joe Damato in response to
my bug report in [1].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38017 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.14.4 with commit 99a0ad16dfd114a429df665065dcc576dad743c0 and fixed in 6.14.8 with commit 7631dca012593c95d36199082546a24a0058fc50

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-38017
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/eventpoll.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
