Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rsrc: don't rely on user vaddr alignment

There is no guaranteed alignment for user pointers, however the
calculation of an offset of the first page into a folio after coalescing
uses some weird bit mask logic, get rid of it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40216 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
