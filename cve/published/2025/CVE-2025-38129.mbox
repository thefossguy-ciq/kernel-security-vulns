root cause is:

page_pool_recycle_in_ring
  ptr_ring_produce
    spin_lock(&r->producer_lock);
    WRITE_ONCE(r->queue[r->producer++], ptr)
      //recycle last page to pool
				page_pool_release
				  page_pool_scrub
				    page_pool_empty_ring
				      ptr_ring_consume
				      page_pool_return_page  //release all page
				  __page_pool_destroy
				     free_percpu(pool->recycle_stats);
				     free(pool) //free

     spin_unlock(&r->producer_lock); //pool->ring uaf read
  recycle_stat_inc(pool, ring);

page_pool can be free while page pool recycle the last page in ring.
Add producer-lock barrier to page_pool_release to prevent the page
pool from being free before all pages have been recycled.

recycle_stat_inc() is empty when CONFIG_PAGE_POOL_STATS is not
enabled, which will trigger Wempty-body build warning. Add definition
for pool stat macro to fix warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
