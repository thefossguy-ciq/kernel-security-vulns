Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling

Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other
packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and
prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and
their skb_shared_info.

The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the
problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.

A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21972 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/mctp/route.c
	net/mctp/test/route-test.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5c47d5bfa7b096cf8890afac32141c578583f8e0
