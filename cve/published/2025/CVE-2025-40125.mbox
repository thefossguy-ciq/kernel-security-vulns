Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: check kobject state_in_sysfs before deleting in blk_mq_unregister_hctx

In __blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues() the return value of
blk_mq_sysfs_register_hctxs() is not checked. If sysfs creation for hctx
fails, later changing the number of hw_queues or removing disk will
trigger the following warning:

  kernfs: can not remove 'nr_tags', no directory
  WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 637 at fs/kernfs/dir.c:1707 kernfs_remove_by_name_ns+0x13f/0x160
  Call Trace:

   nullb_update_nr_hw_queues+0x71/0xf0 [null_blk]
   nullb_device_submit_queues_store+0x92/0x120 [null_blk]

kobjct_del() was called unconditionally even if sysfs creation failed.
Fix it by checkig the kobject creation statusbefore deleting it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40125 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
