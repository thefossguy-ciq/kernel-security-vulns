Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hid-steam: Fix use-after-free when detaching device

When a hid-steam device is removed it must clean up the client_hdev used for
intercepting hidraw access. This can lead to scheduling deferred work to
reattach the input device. Though the cleanup cancels the deferred work, this
was done before the client_hdev itself is cleaned up, so it gets rescheduled.
This patch fixes the ordering to make sure the deferred work is properly
canceled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21923 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
