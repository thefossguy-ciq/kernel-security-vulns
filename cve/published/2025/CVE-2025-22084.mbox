Subject: CVE-2025-22084: w1: fix NULL pointer dereference in probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

w1: fix NULL pointer dereference in probe

The w1_uart_probe() function calls w1_uart_serdev_open() (which includes
devm_serdev_device_open()) before setting the client ops via
serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This ordering can trigger a NULL pointer
dereference in the serdev controller's receive_buf handler, as it assumes
serdev->ops is valid when SERPORT_ACTIVE is set.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition") where
devm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the
device.

Fix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via
w1_uart_serdev_open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
