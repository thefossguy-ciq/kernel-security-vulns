Subject: CVE-2025-39917: bpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix out-of-bounds dynptr write in bpf_crypto_crypt

Stanislav reported that in bpf_crypto_crypt() the destination dynptr's
size is not validated to be at least as large as the source dynptr's
size before calling into the crypto backend with 'len = src_len'. This
can result in an OOB write when the destination is smaller than the
source.

Concretely, in mentioned function, psrc and pdst are both linear
buffers fetched from each dynptr:

  psrc = __bpf_dynptr_data(src, src_len);
  [...]
  pdst = __bpf_dynptr_data_rw(dst, dst_len);
  [...]
  err = decrypt ?
        ctx->type->decrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv) :
        ctx->type->encrypt(ctx->tfm, psrc, pdst, src_len, piv);

The crypto backend expects pdst to be large enough with a src_len length
that can be written. Add an additional src_len > dst_len check and bail
out if it's the case. Note that these kfuncs are accessible under root
privileges only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
