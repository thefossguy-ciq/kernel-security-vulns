Subject: CVE-2025-68352: spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: ch341: fix out-of-bounds memory access in ch341_transfer_one

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

The 'len' variable is calculated as 'min(32, trans->len + 1)',
which includes the 1-byte command header.

When copying data from 'trans->tx_buf' to 'ch341->tx_buf + 1', using 'len'
as the length is incorrect because:

1. It causes an out-of-bounds read from 'trans->tx_buf' (which has size
   'trans->len', i.e., 'len - 1' in this context).
2. It can cause an out-of-bounds write to 'ch341->tx_buf' if 'len' is
   CH341_PACKET_LENGTH (32). Writing 32 bytes to ch341->tx_buf + 1
   overflows the buffer.

Fix this by copying 'len - 1' bytes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68352 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
