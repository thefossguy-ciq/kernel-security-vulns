Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netconsole: Acquire su_mutex before navigating configs hierarchy

There is a race between operations that iterate over the userdata
cg_children list and concurrent add/remove of userdata items through
configfs. The update_userdata() function iterates over the
nt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also
iterates over this same list to count nodes.

Quoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:
> A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer
> to see the tree created by the subsystem.  This can race with configfs'
> management of the hierarchy, so configfs uses the subsystem mutex to
> protect modifications.  Whenever a subsystem wants to navigate the
> hierarchy, it must do so under the protection of the subsystem
> mutex.

Without proper locking, if a userdata item is added or removed
concurrently while these functions are iterating, the list can be
accessed in an inconsistent state. For example, the list_for_each() loop
can reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()
which sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will
never end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).

Fix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all
operations that iterate over cg_children.
This includes:
- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over
  cg_children
- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call
  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children

The su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid
potential lock ordering issues, as configfs operations may already hold
su_mutex when calling into our code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68319 to this issue.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/netconsole.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff70aa7e8cf05745fdba7258952a8bedf33ea336
