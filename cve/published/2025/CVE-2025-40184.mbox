Subject: CVE-2025-40184: KVM: arm64: Fix debug checking for np-guests using huge mappings

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Fix debug checking for np-guests using huge mappings

When running with transparent huge pages and CONFIG_NVHE_EL2_DEBUG then
the debug checking in assert_host_shared_guest() fails on the launch of an
np-guest. This WARN_ON() causes a panic and generates the stack below.

In __pkvm_host_relax_perms_guest() the debug checking assumes the mapping
is a single page but it may be a block map. Update the checking so that
the size is not checked and just assumes the correct size.

While we're here make the same fix in __pkvm_host_mkyoung_guest().

  Info: # lkvm run -k /share/arch/arm64/boot/Image -m 704 -c 8 --name guest-128
  Info: Removed ghost socket file "/.lkvm//guest-128.sock".

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f7af3d8a1177c807d1f2563c7c171700b020656
