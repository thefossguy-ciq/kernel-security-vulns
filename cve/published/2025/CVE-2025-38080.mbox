Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Increase block_sequence array size

[Why]
It's possible to generate more than 50 steps in hwss_build_fast_sequence,
for example with a 6-pipe asic where all pipes are in one MPC chain. This
overflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps,
causing a crash.

[How]
Expand block_sequence to 100 items. A naive upper bound on the possible
number of steps for a 6-pipe asic, ignoring the potential for steps to be
mutually exclusive, is 91 with current code, therefore 100 is sufficient.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38080 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/inc/core_types.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
