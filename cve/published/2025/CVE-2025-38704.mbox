Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu/nocb: Fix possible invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer access

In the preparation stage of CPU online, if the corresponding
the rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread does not exist, will be created,
there is a situation where the rdp's rcuop kthreads creation fails,
and then de-offload this CPU's rdp, does not assign this CPU's
rdp->nocb_cb_kthread pointer, but this rdp's->nocb_gp_rdp and
rdp's->rdp_gp->nocb_gp_kthread is still valid.

This will cause the subsequent re-offload operation of this offline
CPU, which will pass the conditional check and the kthread_unpark()
will access invalid rdp's->nocb_cb_kthread pointer.

This commit therefore use rdp's->nocb_gp_kthread instead of
rdp_gp's->nocb_gp_kthread for safety check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38704 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
