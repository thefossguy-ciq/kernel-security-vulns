Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: bpf: Only mitigate cBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users

Support for eBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users is typically
disabled. This means only cBPF programs need to be mitigated for BHB.

In addition, only mitigate cBPF programs that were loaded by an
unprivileged user. Privileged users can also load the same program
via eBPF, making the mitigation pointless.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37963 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
