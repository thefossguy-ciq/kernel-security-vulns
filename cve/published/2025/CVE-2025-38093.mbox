Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add GPU cooling

Unlike the CPU, the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically when it
reaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to
reach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the
hardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.

Set up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed
when reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38093 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
