Subject: CVE-2025-68255: staging: rtl8723bs: fix stack buffer overflow in OnAssocReq IE parsing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix stack buffer overflow in OnAssocReq IE parsing

The Supported Rates IE length from an incoming Association Request frame
was used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into a fixed-size
16-byte stack buffer (supportRate). A malicious station can advertise an
IE length larger than 16 bytes, causing a stack buffer overflow.

Clamp ie_len to the buffer size before copying the Supported Rates IE,
and correct the bounds check when merging Extended Supported Rates to
prevent a second potential overflow.

This prevents kernel stack corruption triggered by malformed association
requests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68255 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
