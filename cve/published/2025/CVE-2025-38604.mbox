Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: Kill URBs before clearing tx status queue

In rtl8187_stop() move the call of usb_kill_anchored_urbs() before clearing
b_tx_status.queue. This change prevents callbacks from using already freed
skb due to anchor was not killed before freeing such skb.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
