Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix NULL pointer access

This patch ensures that the UCSI driver waits for all pending tasks in the
ucsi_displayport_work workqueue to finish executing before proceeding with
the partner removal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
