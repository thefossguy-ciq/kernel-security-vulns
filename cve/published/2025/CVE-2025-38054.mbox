Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: ocp: Limit signal/freq counts in summary output functions

The debugfs summary output could access uninitialized elements in
the freq_in[] and signal_out[] arrays, causing NULL pointer
dereferences and triggering a kernel Oops (page_fault_oops).
This patch adds u8 fields (nr_freq_in, nr_signal_out) to track the
number of initialized elements, with a maximum of 4 per array.
The summary output functions are updated to respect these limits,
preventing out-of-bounds access and ensuring safe array handling.

Widen the label variables because the change confuses GCC about
max length of the strings.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38054 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/ptp/ptp_ocp.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b7d3e782027ac3b6fec56159e8e348042000aef
