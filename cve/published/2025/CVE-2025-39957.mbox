Subject: CVE-2025-39957: wifi: mac80211: increase scan_ies_len for S1G

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: increase scan_ies_len for S1G

Currently the S1G capability element is not taken into account
for the scan_ies_len, which leads to a buffer length validation
failure in ieee80211_prep_hw_scan() and subsequent WARN in
__ieee80211_start_scan(). This prevents hw scanning from functioning.
To fix ensure we accommodate for the S1G capability length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39957 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
