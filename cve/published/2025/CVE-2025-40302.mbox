Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: videobuf2: forbid remove_bufs when legacy fileio is active

vb2_ioctl_remove_bufs() call manipulates queue internal buffer list,
potentially overwriting some pointers used by the legacy fileio access
mode. Forbid that ioctl when fileio is active to protect internal queue
state between subsequent read/write calls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40302 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
