Subject: CVE-2025-39998: scsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow

A buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the
buffer "buf" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in
/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with
size LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).

snprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name
(hba->hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev->
dev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string
length may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.

Since snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have been
written (the length of %s/%sn ), this value may exceed the buffer length
(256 bytes) passed to memcpy(), this will ultimately cause function
memcpy reporting a buffer overflow error.

An additional check of the return value of snprintf() can avoid this
buffer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39998 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
