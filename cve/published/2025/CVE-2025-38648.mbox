Subject: CVE-2025-38648: spi: stm32: Check for cfg availability in stm32_spi_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: stm32: Check for cfg availability in stm32_spi_probe

The stm32_spi_probe function now includes a check to ensure that the
pointer returned by of_device_get_match_data is not NULL before
accessing its members. This resolves a warning where a potential NULL
pointer dereference could occur when accessing cfg->has_device_mode.

Before accessing the 'has_device_mode' member, we verify that 'cfg' is
not NULL. If 'cfg' is NULL, an error message is logged.

This change ensures that the driver does not attempt to access
configuration data if it is not available, thus preventing a potential
system crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38648 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
