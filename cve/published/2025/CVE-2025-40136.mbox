Subject: CVE-2025-40136: crypto: hisilicon/qm - request reserved interrupt for virtual function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/qm - request reserved interrupt for virtual function

The device interrupt vector 3 is an error interrupt for
physical function and a reserved interrupt for virtual function.
However, the driver has not registered the reserved interrupt for
virtual function. When allocating interrupts, the number of interrupts
is allocated based on powers of two, which includes this interrupt.
When the system enables GICv4 and the virtual function passthrough
to the virtual machine, releasing the interrupt in the driver
triggers a warning.

The WARNING report is:
WARNING: CPU: 62 PID: 14889 at arch/arm64/kvm/vgic/vgic-its.c:852 its_free_ite+0x94/0xb4

Therefore, register a reserved interrupt for VF and set the
IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag to avoid that warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40136 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
