Subject: CVE-2025-38537: net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: Don't register LEDs for genphy

If a PHY has no driver, the genphy driver is probed/removed directly in
phy_attach/detach. If the PHY's ofnode has an "leds" subnode, then the
LEDs will be (un)registered when probing/removing the genphy driver.
This could occur if the leds are for a non-generic driver that isn't
loaded for whatever reason. Synchronously removing the PHY device in
phy_detach leads to the following deadlock:

rtnl_lock()
ndo_close()
    ...
    phy_detach()
        phy_remove()
            phy_leds_unregister()
                led_classdev_unregister()
                    led_trigger_set()
                        netdev_trigger_deactivate()
                            unregister_netdevice_notifier()
                                rtnl_lock()

There is a corresponding deadlock on the open/register side of things
(and that one is reported by lockdep), but it requires a race while this
one is deterministic.

Generic PHYs do not support LEDs anyway, so don't bother registering
them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38537 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
