Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vxlan: Fix NPD when refreshing an FDB entry with a nexthop object

VXLAN FDB entries can point to either a remote destination or an FDB
nexthop group. The latter is usually used in EVPN deployments where
learning is disabled.

However, when learning is enabled, an incoming packet might try to
refresh an FDB entry that points to an FDB nexthop group and therefore
does not have a remote. Such packets should be dropped, but they are
only dropped after dereferencing the non-existent remote, resulting in a
NPD [1] which can be reproduced using [2].

Fix by dropping such packets earlier. Remove the misleading comment from
first_remote_rcu().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ff4f3104da6507e0f118c63c4560dfdeb59dce3
