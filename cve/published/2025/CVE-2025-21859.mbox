Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: gadget: f_midi: f_midi_complete to call queue_work

When using USB MIDI, a lock is attempted to be acquired twice through a
re-entrant call to f_midi_transmit, causing a deadlock.

Fix it by using queue_work() to schedule the inner f_midi_transmit() via
a high priority work queue from the completion handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
