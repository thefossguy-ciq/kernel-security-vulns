Subject: CVE-2025-71115: um: init cpu_tasks[] earlier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: init cpu_tasks[] earlier

This is currently done in uml_finishsetup(), but e.g. with
KCOV enabled we'll crash because some init code can call
into e.g. memparse(), which has coverage annotations, and
then the checks in check_kcov_mode() crash because current
is NULL.

Simply initialize the cpu_tasks[] array statically, which
fixes the crash. For the later SMP work, it seems to have
not really caused any problems yet, but initialize all of
the entries anyway.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71115 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
