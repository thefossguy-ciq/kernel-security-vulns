Subject: CVE-2025-38674: Revert "drm/prime: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "drm/prime: Use dma_buf from GEM object instance"

This reverts commit f83a9b8c7fd0557b0c50784bfdc1bbe9140c9bf8.

The dma_buf field in struct drm_gem_object is not stable over the
object instance's lifetime. The field becomes NULL when user space
releases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted
in a NULL-pointer deref.

Workarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 ("drm/gem: Acquire references on
GEM handles for framebuffers") and commit f6bfc9afc751 ("drm/framebuffer:
Acquire internal references on GEM handles") only solved the problem
partially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM
framebuffer associated.

Hence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.

v3:
- cc stable

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38674 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f05d83ce689a8930a70dfa73f879604aef8cc03
