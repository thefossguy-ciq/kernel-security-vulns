Subject: CVE-2025-39763: ACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: APEI: send SIGBUS to current task if synchronous memory error not recovered

If a synchronous error is detected as a result of user-space process
triggering a 2-bit uncorrected error, the CPU will take a synchronous
error exception such as Synchronous External Abort (SEA) on Arm64. The
kernel will queue a memory_failure() work which poisons the related
page, unmaps the page, and then sends a SIGBUS to the process, so that
a system wide panic can be avoided.

However, no memory_failure() work will be queued when abnormal
synchronous errors occur. These errors can include situations like
invalid PA, unexpected severity, no memory failure config support,
invalid GUID section, etc. In such a case, the user-space process will
trigger SEA again.  This loop can potentially exceed the platform
firmware threshold or even trigger a kernel hard lockup, leading to a
system reboot.

Fix it by performing a force kill if no memory_failure() work is queued
for synchronous errors.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
