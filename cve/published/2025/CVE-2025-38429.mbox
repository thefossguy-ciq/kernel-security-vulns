Subject: CVE-2025-38429: bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer is written

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: ep: Update read pointer only after buffer is written

Inside mhi_ep_ring_add_element, the read pointer (rd_offset) is updated
before the buffer is written, potentially causing race conditions where
the host sees an updated read pointer before the buffer is actually
written. Updating rd_offset prematurely can lead to the host accessing
an uninitialized or incomplete element, resulting in data corruption.

Invoke the buffer write before updating rd_offset to ensure the element
is fully written before signaling its availability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38429 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
