Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: fix NULL pointer deference when splitting folio

Commit c010d47f107f ("mm: thp: split huge page to any lower order pages")
introduced an early check on the folio's order via mapping->flags before
proceeding with the split work.

This check introduced a bug: for shmem folios in the swap cache and
truncated folios, the mapping pointer can be NULL.  Accessing
mapping->flags in this state leads directly to a NULL pointer dereference.

This commit fixes the issue by moving the check for mapping != NULL before
any attempt to access mapping->flags.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68293 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
