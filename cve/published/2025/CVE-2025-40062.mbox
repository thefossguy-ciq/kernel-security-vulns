Subject: CVE-2025-40062: crypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm->debug.qm_diff_regs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/qm - set NULL to qm->debug.qm_diff_regs

When the initialization of qm->debug.acc_diff_reg fails,
the probe process does not exit. However, after qm->debug.qm_diff_regs is
freed, it is not set to NULL. This can lead to a double free when the
remove process attempts to free it again. Therefore, qm->debug.qm_diff_regs
should be set to NULL after it is freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40062 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
