Subject: CVE-2025-37792: Bluetooth: btrtl: Prevent potential NULL dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btrtl: Prevent potential NULL dereference

The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either
had an error or it loaded a zero length file.  However, if it loaded
a zero length file then the error code is not set correctly.  It
results in an error pointer vs NULL bug, followed by a NULL pointer
dereference.  This was detected by Smatch:

drivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c:592 btrtl_initialize() warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37792 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
