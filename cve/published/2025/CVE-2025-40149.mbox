Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in get_netdev_for_sock().

get_netdev_for_sock() is called during setsockopt(),
so not under RCU.

Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().

Note that the only ->ndo_sk_get_lower_dev() user is
bond_sk_get_lower_dev(), which uses RCU.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40149 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/feb474ddbf26b51f462ae2e60a12013bdcfc5407
