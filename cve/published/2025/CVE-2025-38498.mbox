Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

do_change_type(): refuse to operate on unmounted/not ours mounts

Ensure that propagation settings can only be changed for mounts located
in the caller's mount namespace. This change aligns permission checking
with the rest of mount(2).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38498 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
