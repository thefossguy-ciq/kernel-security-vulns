Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

futex: Use correct exit on failure from futex_hash_allocate_default()

copy_process() uses the wrong error exit path from futex_hash_allocate_default().
After exiting from futex_hash_allocate_default(), neither tasklist_lock
nor siglock has been acquired. The exit label bad_fork_core_free unlocks
both of these locks which is wrong.

The next exit label, bad_fork_cancel_cgroup, is the correct exit.
sched_cgroup_fork() did not allocate any resources that need to freed.

Use bad_fork_cancel_cgroup on error exit from futex_hash_allocate_default().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39976 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1635765cd0fdbf27b04d9a50be91a01b5adda13
