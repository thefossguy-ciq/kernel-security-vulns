Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components

By sharing 'name' directly, tearing down components may lead to
use-after-free errors. Duplicate the name to avoid that.

At the same time, update the order of operations - since commit
cee28113db17 ("ASoC: dmaengine_pcm: Allow passing component name via
config") the framework does not override component->name if set before
invoking the initializer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40338 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.17.8 with commit 128bf29c992988f8b4f3829227339908fde5ec86
	Fixed in 6.18 with commit 4dee5c1cc439b0d5ef87f741518268ad6a95b23d

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-40338
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/soc/intel/avs/pcm.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/128bf29c992988f8b4f3829227339908fde5ec86
