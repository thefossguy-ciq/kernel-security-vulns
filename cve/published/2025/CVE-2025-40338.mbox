Subject: CVE-2025-40338: ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: avs: Do not share the name pointer between components

By sharing 'name' directly, tearing down components may lead to
use-after-free errors. Duplicate the name to avoid that.

At the same time, update the order of operations - since commit
cee28113db17 ("ASoC: dmaengine_pcm: Allow passing component name via
config") the framework does not override component->name if set before
invoking the initializer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40338 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/128bf29c992988f8b4f3829227339908fde5ec86
