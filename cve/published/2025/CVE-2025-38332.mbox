Subject: CVE-2025-38332: scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version

The strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it
thinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target
buffer size is passed in.

Anyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just use
memcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.

BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a
properly terminated string.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38332 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
