Subject: CVE-2025-38238: scsi: fnic: Fix crash in fnic_wq_cmpl_handler when FDMI times out

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: fnic: Fix crash in fnic_wq_cmpl_handler when FDMI times out

When both the RHBA and RPA FDMI requests time out, fnic reuses a frame to
send ABTS for each of them. On send completion, this causes an attempt to
free the same frame twice that leads to a crash.

Fix crash by allocating separate frames for RHBA and RPA, and modify ABTS
logic accordingly.

Tested by checking MDS for FDMI information.

Tested by using instrumented driver to:

 - Drop PLOGI response
 - Drop RHBA response
 - Drop RPA response
 - Drop RHBA and RPA response
 - Drop PLOGI response + ABTS response
 - Drop RHBA response + ABTS response
 - Drop RPA response + ABTS response
 - Drop RHBA and RPA response + ABTS response for both of them

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38238 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
