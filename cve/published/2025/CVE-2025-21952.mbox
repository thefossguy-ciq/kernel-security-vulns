Subject: CVE-2025-21952: HID: corsair-void: Update power supply values with a unified work handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: corsair-void: Update power supply values with a unified work handler

corsair_void_process_receiver can be called from an interrupt context,
locking battery_mutex in it was causing a kernel panic.
Fix it by moving the critical section into its own work, sharing this
work with battery_add_work and battery_remove_work to remove the need
for any locking

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de19c9dfb68f7c5791accc89047f92e952f57996
