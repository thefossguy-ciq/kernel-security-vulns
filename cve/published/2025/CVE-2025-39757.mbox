Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Validate UAC3 cluster segment descriptors

UAC3 class segment descriptors need to be verified whether their sizes
match with the declared lengths and whether they fit with the
allocated buffer sizes, too.  Otherwise malicious firmware may lead to
the unexpected OOB accesses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39757 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
