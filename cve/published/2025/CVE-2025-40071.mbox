Subject: CVE-2025-40071: tty: n_gsm: Don't block input queue by waiting MSC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: n_gsm: Don't block input queue by waiting MSC

Currently gsm_queue() processes incoming frames and when opening
a DLC channel it calls gsm_dlci_open() which calls gsm_modem_update().
If basic mode is used it calls gsm_modem_upd_via_msc() and it
cannot block the input queue by waiting the response to come
into the same input queue.

Instead allow sending Modem Status Command without waiting for remote
end to respond. Define a new function gsm_modem_send_initial_msc()
for this purpose. As MSC is only valid for basic encoding, it does
not do anything for advanced or when convergence layer type 2 is used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
