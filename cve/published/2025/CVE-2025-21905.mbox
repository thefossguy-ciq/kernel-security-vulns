Subject: CVE-2025-21905: wifi: iwlwifi: limit printed string from FW file

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: limit printed string from FW file

There's no guarantee here that the file is always with a
NUL-termination, so reading the string may read beyond the
end of the TLV. If that's the last TLV in the file, it can
perhaps even read beyond the end of the file buffer.

Fix that by limiting the print format to the size of the
buffer we have.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21905 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
