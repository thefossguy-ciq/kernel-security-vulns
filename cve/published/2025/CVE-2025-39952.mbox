Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wilc1000: avoid buffer overflow in WID string configuration

Fix the following copy overflow warning identified by Smatch checker.

 drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/wlan_cfg.c:184 wilc_wlan_parse_response_frame()
        error: '__memcpy()' 'cfg->s[i]->str' copy overflow (512 vs 65537)

This patch introduces size check before accessing the memory buffer.
The checks are base on the WID type of received data from the firmware.
For WID string configuration, the size limit is determined by individual
element size in 'struct wilc_cfg_str_vals' that is maintained in 'len' field
of 'struct wilc_cfg_str'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
