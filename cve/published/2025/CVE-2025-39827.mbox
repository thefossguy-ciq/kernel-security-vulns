Subject: CVE-2025-39827: net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: include node references in rose_neigh refcount

Current implementation maintains two separate reference counting
mechanisms: the 'count' field in struct rose_neigh tracks references from
rose_node structures, while the 'use' field (now refcount_t) tracks
references from rose_sock.

This patch merges these two reference counting systems using 'use' field
for proper reference management. Specifically, this patch adds incrementing
and decrementing of rose_neigh->use when rose_neigh->count is incremented
or decremented.

This patch also modifies rose_rt_free(), rose_rt_device_down() and
rose_clear_route() to properly release references to rose_neigh objects
before freeing a rose_node through rose_remove_node().

These changes ensure rose_neigh structures are properly freed only when
all references, including those from rose_node structures, are released.
As a result, this resolves a slab-use-after-free issue reported by Syzbot.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39827 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
