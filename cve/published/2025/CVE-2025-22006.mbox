Subject: CVE-2025-22006: net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.
This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the
randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
reception of traffic from the wire.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22006 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
