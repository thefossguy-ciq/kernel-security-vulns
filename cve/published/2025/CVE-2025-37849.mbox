Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Tear down vGIC on failed vCPU creation

If kvm_arch_vcpu_create() fails to share the vCPU page with the
hypervisor, we propagate the error back to the ioctl but leave the
vGIC vCPU data initialised. Note only does this leak the corresponding
memory when the vCPU is destroyed but it can also lead to use-after-free
if the redistributor device handling tries to walk into the vCPU.

Add the missing cleanup to kvm_arch_vcpu_create(), ensuring that the
vGIC vCPU structures are destroyed on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
