Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix potential deadlock while nr_requests grown

Allocate and free sched_tags while queue is freezed can deadlock[1],
this is a long term problem, hence allocate memory before freezing
queue and free memory after queue is unfreezed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d26acf8477174d8ef690eb6affe13a630f586ae
