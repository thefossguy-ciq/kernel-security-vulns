Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix incomplete backport in cfids_invalidation_worker()

The previous commit bdb596ceb4b7 ("smb: client: fix potential UAF in
smb2_close_cached_fid()") was an incomplete backport and missed one
kref_put() call in cfids_invalidation_worker() that should have been
converted to close_cached_dir().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
