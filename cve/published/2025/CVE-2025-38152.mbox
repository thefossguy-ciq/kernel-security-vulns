Subject: CVE-2025-38152: remoteproc: core: Clear table_sz when rproc_shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: core: Clear table_sz when rproc_shutdown

There is case as below could trigger kernel dump:
Use U-Boot to start remote processor(rproc) with resource table
published to a fixed address by rproc. After Kernel boots up,
stop the rproc, load a new firmware which doesn't have resource table
,and start rproc.

When starting rproc with a firmware not have resource table,
`memcpy(loaded_table, rproc->cached_table, rproc->table_sz)` will
trigger dump, because rproc->cache_table is set to NULL during the last
stop operation, but rproc->table_sz is still valid.

This issue is found on i.MX8MP and i.MX9.

Dump as below:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
