Subject: CVE-2025-38243: btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

In a few places where we call read_one_inode(), if we get a NULL pointer
we end up jumping into an error path, or fallthrough in case of
__add_inode_ref(), where we then do something like this:

   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);

which results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory
access, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38243 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
