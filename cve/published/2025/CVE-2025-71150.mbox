Subject: CVE-2025-71150: ksmbd: Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup

When a session is found but its state is not SMB2_SESSION_VALID, It
indicates that no valid session was found, but it is missing to decrement
the reference count acquired by the session lookup, which results in
a reference count leak. This patch fixes the issue by explicitly calling
ksmbd_user_session_put to release the reference to the session.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71150 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
