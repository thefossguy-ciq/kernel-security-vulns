Subject: CVE-2025-68724: crypto: asymmetric_keys - prevent overflow in asymmetric_key_generate_id

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: asymmetric_keys - prevent overflow in asymmetric_key_generate_id

Use check_add_overflow() to guard against potential integer overflows
when adding the binary blob lengths and the size of an asymmetric_key_id
structure and return ERR_PTR(-EOVERFLOW) accordingly. This prevents a
possible buffer overflow when copying data from potentially malicious
X.509 certificate fields that can be arbitrarily large, such as ASN.1
INTEGER serial numbers, issuer names, etc.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68724 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
