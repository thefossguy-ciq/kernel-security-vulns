Subject: CVE-2025-71181: rust_binder: remove spin_lock() in rust_shrink_free_page()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rust_binder: remove spin_lock() in rust_shrink_free_page()

When forward-porting Rust Binder to 6.18, I neglected to take commit
fb56fdf8b9a2 ("mm/list_lru: split the lock to per-cgroup scope") into
account, and apparently I did not end up running the shrinker callback
when I sanity tested the driver before submission. This leads to crashes
like the following:

	============================================
	WARNING: possible recursive locking detected
	6.18.0-mainline-maybe-dirty #1 Tainted: G          IO
	--------------------------------------------
	kswapd0/68 is trying to acquire lock:
	ffff956000fa18b0 (&l->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: lock_list_lru_of_memcg+0x128/0x230

	but task is already holding lock:
	ffff956000fa18b0 (&l->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: rust_helper_spin_lock+0xd/0x20

	other info that might help us debug this:
	 Possible unsafe locking scenario:

	       CPU0
	       ----
	  lock(&l->lock);
	  lock(&l->lock);

	 *** DEADLOCK ***

	 May be due to missing lock nesting notation

	3 locks held by kswapd0/68:
	 #0: ffffffff90d2e260 (fs_reclaim){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: kswapd+0x597/0x1160
	 #1: ffff956000fa18b0 (&l->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: rust_helper_spin_lock+0xd/0x20
	 #2: ffffffff90cf3680 (rcu_read_lock){....}-{1:2}, at: lock_list_lru_of_memcg+0x2d/0x230

To fix this, remove the spin_lock() call from rust_shrink_free_page().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71181 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/30a98c97f7874031f2e1de19c777ce011143cba4
