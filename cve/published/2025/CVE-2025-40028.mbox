Subject: CVE-2025-40028: binder: fix double-free in dbitmap

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix double-free in dbitmap

A process might fail to allocate a new bitmap when trying to expand its
proc->dmap. In that case, dbitmap_grow() fails and frees the old bitmap
via dbitmap_free(). However, the driver calls dbitmap_free() again when
the same process terminates, leading to a double-free error:

Fix this issue by marking proc->map NULL in dbitmap_free().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40028 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
