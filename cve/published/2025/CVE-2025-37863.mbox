Subject: CVE-2025-37863: ovl: don't allow datadir only

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ovl: don't allow datadir only

In theory overlayfs could support upper layer directly referring to a data
layer, but there's no current use case for this.

Originally, when data-only layers were introduced, this wasn't allowed,
only introduced by the "datadir+" feature, but without actually handling
this case, resulting in an Oops.

Fix by disallowing datadir without lowerdir.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37863 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
