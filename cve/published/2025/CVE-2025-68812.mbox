Subject: CVE-2025-68812: media: iris: Add sanity check for stop streaming

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: iris: Add sanity check for stop streaming

Add sanity check in iris_vb2_stop_streaming. If inst->state is
already IRIS_INST_ERROR, we should skip the stream_off operation
because it would still send packets to the firmware.

In iris_kill_session, inst->state is set to IRIS_INST_ERROR and
session_close is executed, which will kfree(inst_hfi_gen2->packet).
If stop_streaming is called afterward, it will cause a crash.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
