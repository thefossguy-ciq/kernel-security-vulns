Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: class: Fix NULL pointer access

Concurrent calls to typec_partner_unlink_device can lead to a NULL pointer
dereference. This patch adds a mutex to protect USB device pointers and
prevent this issue. The same mutex protects both the device pointers and
the partner device registration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37809 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de7c24febd21413ea8f49f61b36338b676c02852
