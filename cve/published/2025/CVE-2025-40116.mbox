Subject: CVE-2025-40116: usb: host: max3421-hcd: Fix error pointer dereference in probe cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: host: max3421-hcd: Fix error pointer dereference in probe cleanup

The kthread_run() function returns error pointers so the
max3421_hcd->spi_thread pointer can be either error pointers or NULL.
Check for both before dereferencing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40116 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
