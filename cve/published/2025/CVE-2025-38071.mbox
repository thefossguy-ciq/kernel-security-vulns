Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm: Check return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()

At least with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000, if there is < 4 MiB of
contiguous free memory available at this point, the kernel will crash
and burn because memblock_phys_alloc_range() returns 0 on failure,
which leads memblock_phys_free() to throw the first 4 MiB of physical
memory to the wolves.

At a minimum it should fail gracefully with a meaningful diagnostic,
but in fact everything seems to work fine without the weird reserve
allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
