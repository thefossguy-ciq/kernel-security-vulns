Subject: CVE-2025-40224: hwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()

The driver allocates memory for sensor data using devm_kzalloc(), but
did not check if the allocation succeeded. In case of memory allocation
failure, dereferencing the NULL pointer would lead to a kernel crash.

Add a NULL pointer check and return -ENOMEM to handle allocation failure
properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40224 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/240b82b86a091c1aa49d951d4467425420a081a0
