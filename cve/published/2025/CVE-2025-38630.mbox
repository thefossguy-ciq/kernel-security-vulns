Subject: CVE-2025-38630: fbdev: imxfb: Check fb_add_videomode to prevent null-ptr-deref

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: imxfb: Check fb_add_videomode to prevent null-ptr-deref

fb_add_videomode() can fail with -ENOMEM when its internal kmalloc() cannot
allocate a struct fb_modelist.  If that happens, the modelist stays empty but
the driver continues to register.  Add a check for its return value to prevent
poteintial null-ptr-deref, which is similar to the commit 17186f1f90d3 ("fbdev:
Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38630 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
