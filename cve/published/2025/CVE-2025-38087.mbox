Subject: CVE-2025-38087: net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Since taprio’s taprio_dev_notifier() isn’t protected by an
RCU read-side critical section, a race with advance_sched()
can lead to a use-after-free.

Adding rcu_read_lock() inside taprio_dev_notifier() prevents this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
