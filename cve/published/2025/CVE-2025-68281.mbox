Subject: CVE-2025-68281: ASoC: SDCA: bug fix while parsing mipi-sdca-control-cn-list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SDCA: bug fix while parsing mipi-sdca-control-cn-list

But the memory allocated to it is of char array. This causes
crash for sdca_parse_function API. This patch addresses the
issue by allocating correct data size.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
