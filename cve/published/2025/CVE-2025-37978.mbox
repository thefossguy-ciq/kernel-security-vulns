Subject: CVE-2025-37978: block: integrity: Do not call set_page_dirty_lock()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: integrity: Do not call set_page_dirty_lock()

Placing multiple protection information buffers inside the same page
can lead to oopses because set_page_dirty_lock() can't be called from
interrupt context.

Since a protection information buffer is not backed by a file there is
no point in setting its page dirty, there is nothing to synchronize.
Drop the call to set_page_dirty_lock() and remove the last argument to
bio_integrity_unpin_bvec().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
