Subject: CVE-2025-71094: net: usb: asix: validate PHY address before use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix: validate PHY address before use

The ASIX driver reads the PHY address from the USB device via
asix_read_phy_addr(). A malicious or faulty device can return an
invalid address (>= PHY_MAX_ADDR), which causes a warning in
mdiobus_get_phy():

  addr 207 out of range
  WARNING: drivers/net/phy/mdio_bus.c:76

Validate the PHY address in asix_read_phy_addr() and remove the
now-redundant check in ax88172a.c.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
