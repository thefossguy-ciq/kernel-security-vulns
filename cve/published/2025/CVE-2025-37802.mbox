Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix WARNING "do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING"

wait_event_timeout() will set the state of the current
task to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, before doing the condition check. This
means that ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive() will try to acquire the mutex
while already in a sleeping state. The scheduler warns us by giving
the following warning:

do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=2 set at
 [<0000000061515a6f>] prepare_to_wait_event+0x9f/0x6c0
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 4147 at kernel/sched/core.c:10099 __might_sleep+0x12f/0x160

mutex lock is not needed in ksmbd_durable_scavenger_alive().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37802 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8f805b3746d2f41702c77cba22f94f8415fadd1a
