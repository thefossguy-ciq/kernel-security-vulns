Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()

On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL
pointer dereference occurs.

The following sequence deletes the interface:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_remove_interface()
      brcmf_del_if()

Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to
BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.

After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is
called providing the following sequence:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_proto_detach()
      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()
        brcmf_flowring_detach()
          brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()
            brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()
              brcmf_flowring_delete()
                brcmf_get_ifp()
                brcmf_txfinalize()

Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the
call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside
brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.

This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.

Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to
update the tx statistic, all other uses of the ifp pointer have been
guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21744 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
