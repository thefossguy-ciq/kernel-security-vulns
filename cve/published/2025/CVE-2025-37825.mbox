Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix out-of-bounds access in nvmet_enable_port

When trying to enable a port that has no transport configured yet,
nvmet_enable_port() uses NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX (255) to query the transports
array, causing an out-of-bounds access:

[  106.058694] BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in nvmet_enable_port+0x42/0x1da
[  106.058719] Read of size 8 at addr ffffffff89dafa58 by task ln/632
[...]
[  106.076026] nvmet: transport type 255 not supported

Since commit 200adac75888, NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX is the default state as configured by
nvmet_ports_make().
Avoid this by checking for NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX before proceeding.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37825 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83c00860a37b3fcba8026cb344101f1b8af547cf
