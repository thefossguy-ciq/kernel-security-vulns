Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix panic in failed foilio allocation

commit 7e119cff9d0a ("ocfs2: convert w_pages to w_folios") and commit
9a5e08652dc4b ("ocfs2: use an array of folios instead of an array of
pages") save -ENOMEM in the folio array upon allocation failure and call
the folio array free code.

The folio array free code expects either valid folio pointers or NULL. 
Finding the -ENOMEM will result in a panic.  Fix by NULLing the error
folio entry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/80d18f060d5bdf2c5eb3d1d00dcb744d6a879222
