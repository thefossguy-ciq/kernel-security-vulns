Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: at91: Fix possible out-of-boundary access

at91_gpio_probe() doesn't check that given OF alias is not available or
something went wrong when trying to get it. This might have consequences
when accessing gpio_chips array with that value as an index. Note, that
BUG() can be compiled out and hence won't actually perform the required
checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38286 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
