Subject: CVE-2025-71144: mptcp: ensure context reset on disconnect()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: ensure context reset on disconnect()

After the blamed commit below, if the MPC subflow is already in TCP_CLOSE
status or has fallback to TCP at mptcp_disconnect() time,
mptcp_do_fastclose() skips setting the `send_fastclose flag` and the later
__mptcp_close_ssk() does not reset anymore the related subflow context.

Any later connection will be created with both the `request_mptcp` flag
and the msk-level fallback status off (it is unconditionally cleared at
MPTCP disconnect time), leading to a warning in subflow_data_ready():

Address the issue setting an explicit `fastclosing` flag at fastclose
time, and checking such flag after mptcp_do_fastclose().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71144 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
