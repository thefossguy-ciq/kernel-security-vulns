The sequence is as follows:

	__dev_change_flags()->
	__dev_open()->
	dev_set_rx_mode() - >  # disables BH and grabs "dev->addr_list_lock"
	idpf_set_rx_mode() ->  # proceed only if VIRTCHNL2_CAP_MACFILTER is ON
	__dev_uc_sync() ->
	idpf_add_mac_filter ->
	idpf_add_del_mac_filters ->
	idpf_send_mb_msg() ->
	idpf_mb_clean() ->
	idpf_ctlq_clean_sq()   # mutex_lock(cq_lock)

Fix by converting cq_lock to a spinlock. All operations under the new
lock are safe except freeing the DMA memory, which may use vunmap(). Fix
by requesting a contiguous physical memory for the DMA mapping.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38392 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
