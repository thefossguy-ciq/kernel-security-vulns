Subject: CVE-2025-71200: mmc: sdhci-of-dwcmshc: Prevent illegal clock reduction in HS200/HS400 mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: sdhci-of-dwcmshc: Prevent illegal clock reduction in HS200/HS400 mode

When operating in HS200 or HS400 timing modes, reducing the clock frequency
below 52MHz will lead to link broken as the Rockchip DWC MSHC controller
requires maintaining a minimum clock of 52MHz in these modes.

Add a check to prevent illegal clock reduction through debugfs:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
