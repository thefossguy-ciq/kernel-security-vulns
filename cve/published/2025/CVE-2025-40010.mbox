Subject: CVE-2025-40010: afs: Fix potential null pointer dereference in afs_put_server

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix potential null pointer dereference in afs_put_server

afs_put_server() accessed server->debug_id before the NULL check, which
could lead to a null pointer dereference. Move the debug_id assignment,
ensuring we never dereference a NULL server pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40010 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
