Subject: CVE-2025-37822: riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer

The XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is used to single-step the
replaced instruction(s) for uprobes. The RISC-V port was missing a
proper fence.i (i$ flushing) after constructing the XOL buffer, which
can result in incorrect execution of stale/broken instructions.

This was found running the BPF selftests "test_progs:
uprobe_autoattach, attach_probe" on the Spacemit K1/X60, where the
uprobes tests randomly blew up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
