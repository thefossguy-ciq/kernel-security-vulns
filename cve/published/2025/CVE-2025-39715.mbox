Subject: CVE-2025-39715: parisc: Revise gateway LWS calls to probe user read access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Revise gateway LWS calls to probe user read access

We use load and stbys,e instructions to trigger memory reference
interruptions without writing to memory. Because of the way read
access support is implemented, read access interruptions are only
triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The kernel and gateway
page execute at privilege level 0, so this code never triggers
a read access interruption. Thus, it is currently possible for
user code to execute a LWS compare and swap operation at an
address that is read protected at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER).

Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 and
branching to lws_fault if access isn't allowed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
