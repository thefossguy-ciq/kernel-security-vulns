Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: libwx: fix Tx L4 checksum

The hardware only supports L4 checksum offload for TCP/UDP/SCTP protocol.
There was a bug to set Tx checksum flag for the other protocol that results
in Tx ring hang. Fix to compute software checksum for these packets.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f583e059eced1857f41e221ef5951e029e632bd
