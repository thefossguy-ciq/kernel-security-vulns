Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &ssi->work is bound with
ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function
within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the
work.

If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()
to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence
of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                    CPU1

                        | ssip_xmit_work
ssi_protocol_remove     |
kfree(ssi);             |
                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi->cl;
                        | // use ssi

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding
with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37838 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.15-rc1 with commit e3f88665a78045fe35c7669d2926b8d97b892c11

will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/hsi/clients/ssi_protocol.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
