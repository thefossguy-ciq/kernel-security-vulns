Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Fix unlikely race in gdlm_put_lock

In gdlm_put_lock(), there is a small window of time in which the
DFL_UNMOUNT flag has been set but the lockspace hasn't been released,
yet.  In that window, dlm may still call gdlm_ast() and gdlm_bast().
To prevent it from dereferencing freed glock objects, only free the
glock if the lockspace has actually been released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40242 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
