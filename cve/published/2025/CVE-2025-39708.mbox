Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: iris: Fix NULL pointer dereference

A warning reported by smatch indicated a possible null pointer
dereference where one of the arguments to API
"iris_hfi_gen2_handle_system_error" could sometimes be null.

To fix this, add a check to validate that the argument passed is not
null before accessing its members.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/992ddee3c0da5f113ba86892ace467c1ac645538
