Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/habanalabs: support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory

When IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return
addresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without
VM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the
VM_PFNMAP restriction.

Fix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP
in the VMA before mapping. This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel
crashes. The memory is still driver-allocated and cannot be accessed
directly by userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40311 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
