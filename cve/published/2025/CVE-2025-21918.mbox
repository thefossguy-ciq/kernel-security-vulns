Subject: CVE-2025-21918: usb: typec: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer access

Resources should be released only after all threads that utilize them
have been destroyed.
This commit ensures that resources are not released prematurely by waiting
for the associated workqueue to complete before deallocating them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21918 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
