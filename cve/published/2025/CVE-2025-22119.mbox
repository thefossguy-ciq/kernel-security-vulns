Subject: CVE-2025-22119: wifi: cfg80211: init wiphy_work before allocating rfkill fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: init wiphy_work before allocating rfkill fails

syzbort reported a uninitialize wiphy_work_lock in cfg80211_dev_free. [1]

After rfkill allocation fails, the wiphy release process will be performed,
which will cause cfg80211_dev_free to access the uninitialized wiphy_work
related data.

Move the initialization of wiphy_work to before rfkill initialization to
avoid this issue.

[1]
INFO: trying to register non-static key.
The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe
you didn't initialize this object before use?
turning off the locking correctness validator.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
