Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test

The igb driver currently causes a NULL pointer dereference when executing
the ethtool loopback test. This occurs because there is no associated
q_vector for the test ring when it is set up, as interrupts are typically
not added to the test rings.

Since commit 5ef44b3cb43b removed the napi_id assignment in
__xdp_rxq_info_reg(), there is no longer a need to pass a napi_id to it.
Therefore, simply use 0 as the last parameter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39875 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/473be7d39efd3be383e9c0c8e44b53508b4ffeb5
