Subject: CVE-2025-71117: block: Remove queue freezing from several sysfs store callbacks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Remove queue freezing from several sysfs store callbacks

Freezing the request queue from inside sysfs store callbacks may cause a
deadlock in combination with the dm-multipath driver and the
queue_if_no_path option. Additionally, freezing the request queue slows
down system boot on systems where sysfs attributes are set synchronously.

Fix this by removing the blk_mq_freeze_queue() / blk_mq_unfreeze_queue()
calls from the store callbacks that do not strictly need these callbacks.
Add the __data_racy annotation to request_queue.rq_timeout to suppress
KCSAN data race reports about the rq_timeout reads.

This patch may cause a small delay in applying the new settings.

For all the attributes affected by this patch, I/O will complete
correctly whether the old or the new value of the attribute is used.

This patch affects the following sysfs attributes:
* io_poll_delay
* io_timeout
* nomerges
* read_ahead_kb
* rq_affinity

Here is an example of a deadlock triggered by running test srp/002
if this patch is not applied:

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	block/blk-sysfs.c
	include/linux/blkdev.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3997b3147c7b68b0308378fa95a766015f8ceb1c
