Subject: CVE-2025-40227: mm/damon/sysfs: dealloc commit test ctx always

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs: dealloc commit test ctx always

The damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is
deallocated only when the test fails.  This means memory is leaked for
every successful online DAMON parameters commit.  Fix the leak by always
deallocating it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
