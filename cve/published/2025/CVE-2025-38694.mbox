Subject: CVE-2025-38694: media: dvb-frontends: dib7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-frontends: dib7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()

In dib7090p_rw_on_apb, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and
msg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing
msg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen. We add
check on msg[0].len to prevent crash. Similar issue occurs when access
msg[1].buf[0] and msg[1].buf[1].

Similar commit: commit 0ed554fd769a ("media: dvb-usb: az6027: fix null-ptr-deref in az6027_i2c_xfer()")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
