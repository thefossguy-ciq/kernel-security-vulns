Subject: CVE-2025-37875: igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37875 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
