Subject: CVE-2025-38467: drm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon: add vblank check in IRQ handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/exynos: exynos7_drm_decon: add vblank check in IRQ handling

If there's support for another console device (such as a TTY serial),
the kernel occasionally panics during boot. The panic message and a
relevant snippet of the call stack is as follows:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 000000000000000
  Call trace:
    drm_crtc_handle_vblank+0x10/0x30 (P)
    decon_irq_handler+0x88/0xb4
    [...]

Otherwise, the panics don't happen. This indicates that it's some sort
of race condition.

Add a check to validate if the drm device can handle vblanks before
calling drm_crtc_handle_vblank() to avoid this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38467 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
