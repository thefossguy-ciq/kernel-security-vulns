Subject: CVE-2025-37800: driver core: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dev_uevent()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver core: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dev_uevent()

If userspace reads "uevent" device attribute at the same time as another
threads unbinds the device from its driver, change to dev->driver from a
valid pointer to NULL may result in crash. Fix this by using READ_ONCE()
when fetching the pointer, and take bus' drivers klist lock to make sure
driver instance will not disappear while we access it.

Use WRITE_ONCE() when setting the driver pointer to ensure there is no
tearing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37800 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
