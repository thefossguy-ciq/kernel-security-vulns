Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Don't allow evicting of BOs in same VM in array of VM binds

An array of VM binds can potentially evict other buffer objects (BOs)
within the same VM under certain conditions, which may lead to NULL
pointer dereferences later in the bind pipeline. To prevent this, clear
the allow_res_evict flag in the xe_bo_validate call.

v2:
 - Invert polarity of no_res_evict (Thomas)
 - Add comment in code explaining issue (Thomas)

(cherry picked from commit 8b9ba8d6d95fe75fed6b0480bb03da4b321bea08)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40086 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5aa0ab0ba7d94549cfe17d6ef7a4f33ba1de8384
