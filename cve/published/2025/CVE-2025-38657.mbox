Subject: CVE-2025-38657: wifi: rtw89: mcc: prevent shift wrapping in rtw89_core_mlsr_switch()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: mcc: prevent shift wrapping in rtw89_core_mlsr_switch()

The "link_id" value comes from the user via debugfs.  If it's larger
than BITS_PER_LONG then that would result in shift wrapping and
potentially an out of bounds access later.  In fact, we can limit it
to IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS (15).

Fortunately, only root can write to debugfs files so the security
impact is minimal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
