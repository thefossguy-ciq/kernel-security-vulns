Subject: CVE-2025-40119: ext4: fix potential null deref in ext4_mb_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix potential null deref in ext4_mb_init()

In ext4_mb_init(), ext4_mb_avg_fragment_size_destroy() may be called
when sbi->s_mb_avg_fragment_size remains uninitialized (e.g., if groupinfo
slab cache allocation fails). Since ext4_mb_avg_fragment_size_destroy()
lacks null pointer checking, this leads to a null pointer dereference.

==================================================================
EXT4-fs: no memory for groupinfo slab cache
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

==================================================================

Therefore, add necessary null check to ext4_mb_avg_fragment_size_destroy()
to prevent this issue. The same fix is also applied to
ext4_mb_largest_free_orders_destroy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40119 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00110f3cfc9b34b2dfee2a6c9e55a0ae6df125ae
