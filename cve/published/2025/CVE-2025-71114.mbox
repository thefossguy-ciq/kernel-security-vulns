Subject: CVE-2025-71114: via_wdt: fix critical boot hang due to unnamed resource allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

via_wdt: fix critical boot hang due to unnamed resource allocation

The VIA watchdog driver uses allocate_resource() to reserve a MMIO
region for the watchdog control register. However, the allocated
resource was not given a name, which causes the kernel resource tree
to contain an entry marked as "<BAD>" under /proc/iomem on x86
platforms.

During boot, this unnamed resource can lead to a critical hang because
subsequent resource lookups and conflict checks fail to handle the
invalid entry properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71114 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
