Subject: CVE-2025-39760: usb: core: config: Prevent OOB read in SS endpoint companion parsing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: core: config: Prevent OOB read in SS endpoint companion parsing

usb_parse_ss_endpoint_companion() checks descriptor type before length,
enabling a potentially odd read outside of the buffer size.

Fix this up by checking the size first before looking at any of the
fields in the descriptor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39760 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
