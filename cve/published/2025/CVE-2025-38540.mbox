Subject: CVE-2025-38540: HID: quirks: Add quirk for 2 Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: quirks: Add quirk for 2 Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras

The Chicony Electronics HP 5MP Cameras (USB ID 04F2:B824 & 04F2:B82C)
report a HID sensor interface that is not actually implemented.
Attempting to access this non-functional sensor via iio_info causes
system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up an unresponsive sensor.

Add these 2 devices to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38540 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
