Subject: CVE-2025-40156: PM / devfreq: mtk-cci: Fix potential error pointer dereference in probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM / devfreq: mtk-cci: Fix potential error pointer dereference in probe()

The drv->sram_reg pointer could be set to ERR_PTR(-EPROBE_DEFER) which
would lead to a error pointer dereference.  Use IS_ERR_OR_NULL() to check
that the pointer is valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40156 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
