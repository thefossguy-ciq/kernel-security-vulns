Subject: CVE-2025-38574: pptp: ensure minimal skb length in pptp_xmit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pptp: ensure minimal skb length in pptp_xmit()

Commit aabc6596ffb3 ("net: ppp: Add bound checking for skb data
on ppp_sync_txmung") fixed ppp_sync_txmunge()

We need a similar fix in pptp_xmit(), otherwise we might
read uninit data as reported by syzbot.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
