Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid5: fix possible null-pointer dereferences in raid5_store_group_thread_cnt()

The variable mddev->private is first assigned to conf and then checked:

  conf = mddev->private;
  if (!conf) ...

If conf is NULL, then mddev->private is also NULL. In this case,
null-pointer dereferences can occur when calling raid5_quiesce():

  raid5_quiesce(mddev, true);
  raid5_quiesce(mddev, false);

since mddev->private is assigned to conf again in raid5_quiesce(), and conf
is dereferenced in several places, for example:

  conf->quiesce = 0;
  wake_up(&conf->wait_for_quiescent);

To fix this issue, the function should unlock mddev and return before
invoking raid5_quiesce() when conf is NULL, following the existing pattern
in raid5_change_consistency_policy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71135 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
