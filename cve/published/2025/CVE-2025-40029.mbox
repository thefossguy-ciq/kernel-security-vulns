Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: fsl-mc: Check return value of platform_get_resource()

platform_get_resource() returns NULL in case of failure, so check its
return value and propagate the error in order to prevent NULL pointer
dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40029 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
