Subject: CVE-2025-38607: bpf: handle jset (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: handle jset (if a & b ...) as a jump in CFG computation

BPF_JSET is a conditional jump and currently verifier.c:can_jump()
does not know about that. This can lead to incorrect live registers
and SCC computation.

E.g. in the following example:

   1: r0 = 1;
   2: r2 = 2;
   3: if r1 & 0x7 goto +1;
   4: exit;
   5: r0 = r2;
   6: exit;

W/o this fix insn_successors(3) will return only (4), a jump to (5)
would be missed and r2 won't be marked as alive at (3).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38607 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
