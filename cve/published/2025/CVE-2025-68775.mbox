Subject: CVE-2025-68775: net/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket

When a handshake request is cancelled it is removed from the
handshake_net->hn_requests list, but it is still present in the
handshake_rhashtbl until it is destroyed.

If a second cancellation request arrives for the same handshake request,
then remove_pending() will return false... and assuming
HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED isn't set in req->hr_flags, we'll continue
processing through the out_true label, where we put another reference on
the sock and a refcount underflow occurs.

This can happen for example if a handshake times out - particularly if
the SUNRPC client sends the AUTH_TLS probe to the server but doesn't
follow it up with the ClientHello due to a problem with tlshd.  When the
timeout is hit on the server, the server will send a FIN, which triggers
a cancellation request via xs_reset_transport().  When the timeout is
hit on the client, another cancellation request happens via
xs_tls_handshake_sync().

Add a test_and_set_bit(HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED) in the pending cancel
path so duplicate cancels can be detected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68775 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
