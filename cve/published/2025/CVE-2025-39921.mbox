Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: microchip-core-qspi: stop checking viability of op->max_freq in supports_op callback

In commit 13529647743d9 ("spi: microchip-core-qspi: Support per spi-mem
operation frequency switches") the logic for checking the viability of
op->max_freq in mchp_coreqspi_setup_clock() was copied into
mchp_coreqspi_supports_op(). Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid
when this function is called during probe but is instead zero.
Accordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division
by zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.

Seemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a
modification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq
capability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39921 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac8a13f35d5b8996582b3f97b924838a5c570c18
