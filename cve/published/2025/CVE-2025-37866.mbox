Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxbf-bootctl: use sysfs_emit_at() in secure_boot_fuse_state_show()

A warning is seen when running the latest kernel on a BlueField SOC:
[251.512704] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[251.512711] invalid sysfs_emit: buf:0000000003aa32ae
[251.512720] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 705264 at fs/sysfs/file.c:767 sysfs_emit+0xac/0xc8

The warning is triggered because the mlxbf-bootctl driver invokes
"sysfs_emit()" with a buffer pointer that is not aligned to the
start of the page. The driver should instead use "sysfs_emit_at()"
to support non-zero offsets into the destination buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37866 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5e1dcc5bfd7a2896178c604bc69d6ab9650967da
