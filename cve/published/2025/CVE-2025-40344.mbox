Subject: CVE-2025-40344: ASoC: Intel: avs: Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: avs: Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM

avs_dai_fe_shutdown() handles the shutdown procedure for HOST HDAudio
stream while period-elapsed work services its IRQs. As the former
frees the DAI's private context, these two operations shall be
synchronized to avoid slab-use-after-free or worse errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40344 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
