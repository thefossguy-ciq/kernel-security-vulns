Subject: CVE-2025-68175: media: nxp: imx8-isi: Fix streaming cleanup on release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: nxp: imx8-isi: Fix streaming cleanup on release

The current implementation unconditionally calls
mxc_isi_video_cleanup_streaming() in mxc_isi_video_release(). This can
lead to situations where any release call (like from a simple
"v4l2-ctl -l") may release a currently streaming queue when called on
such a device.

This is reproducible on an i.MX8MP board by streaming from an ISI
capture device using gstreamer:

	gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/videoX ! \
	    video/x-raw,format=GRAY8,width=1280,height=800,framerate=1/120 ! \
	    fakesink

While this stream is running, querying the caps of the same device
provokes the error state:

	v4l2-ctl -l -d /dev/videoX

This results in the following trace:

Address this issue by moving the streaming preparation and cleanup to
the vb2 .prepare_streaming() and .unprepare_streaming() operations. This
also simplifies the driver by allowing direct usage of the
vb2_ioctl_streamon() and vb2_ioctl_streamoff() helpers, and removal of
the manual cleanup from mxc_isi_video_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
