Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc

As described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class
has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming
that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted
the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem
duplicate case).

This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code
won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the
reentrant case.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
