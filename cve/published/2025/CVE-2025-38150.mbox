Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_packet: move notifier's packet_dev_mc out of rcu critical section

Syzkaller reports the following issue:

Calling `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` on an ops-locked device can trigger
the `NETDEV_UNREGISTER` notifier, which may require disabling promiscuous
and/or allmulti mode. Both of these operations require acquiring
the netdev instance lock.

Move the call to `packet_dev_mc` outside of the RCU critical section.
The `mclist` modifications (add, del, flush, unregister) are protected by
the RTNL, not the RCU. The RCU only protects the `sklist` and its
associated `sks`. The delayed operation on the `mclist` entry remains
within the RTNL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38150 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2dd4781c5af99415ebbd2f7cc763feb109863c05
