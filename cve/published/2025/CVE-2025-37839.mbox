Subject: CVE-2025-37839: jbd2: remove wrong sb->s_sequence check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: remove wrong sb->s_sequence check

Journal emptiness is not determined by sb->s_sequence == 0 but rather by
sb->s_start == 0 (which is set a few lines above). Furthermore 0 is a
valid transaction ID so the check can spuriously trigger. Remove the
invalid WARN_ON.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
