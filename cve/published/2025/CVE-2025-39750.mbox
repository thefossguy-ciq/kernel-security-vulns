Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Correct tid cleanup when tid setup fails

Currently, if any error occurs during ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_setup(),
the tid value is already incremented, even though the corresponding
TID is not actually allocated. Proceed to
ath12k_dp_rx_peer_tid_delete() starting from unallocated tid,
which might leads to freeing unallocated TID and cause potential
crash or out-of-bounds access.

Hence, fix by correctly decrementing tid before cleanup to match only
the successfully allocated TIDs.

Also, remove tid-- from failure case of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(),
as decrementing the tid before cleanup in loop will take care of this.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39750 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
