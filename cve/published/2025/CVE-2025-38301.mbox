Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmem: zynqmp_nvmem: unbreak driver after cleanup

Commit 29be47fcd6a0 ("nvmem: zynqmp_nvmem: zynqmp_nvmem_probe cleanup")
changed the driver to expect the device pointer to be passed as the
"context", but in nvmem the context parameter comes from nvmem_config.priv
which is never set - Leading to null pointer exceptions when the device is
accessed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38301 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
