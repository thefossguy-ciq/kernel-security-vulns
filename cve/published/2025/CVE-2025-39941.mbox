Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

zram: fix slot write race condition

Parallel concurrent writes to the same zram index result in leaked
zsmalloc handles.  Schematically we can have something like this:

CPU0                              CPU1
zram_slot_lock()
zs_free(handle)
zram_slot_lock()
				zram_slot_lock()
				zs_free(handle)
				zram_slot_lock()

compress			compress
handle = zs_malloc()		handle = zs_malloc()
zram_slot_lock
zram_set_handle(handle)
zram_slot_lock
				zram_slot_lock
				zram_set_handle(handle)
				zram_slot_lock

Either CPU0 or CPU1 zsmalloc handle will leak because zs_free() is done
too early.  In fact, we need to reset zram entry right before we set its
new handle, all under the same slot lock scope.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff750e9f2c4d63854c33967d1646b5e89a9a19a2
