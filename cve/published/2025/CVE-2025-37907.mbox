Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix locking order in ivpu_job_submit

Fix deadlock in job submission and abort handling.
When a thread aborts currently executing jobs due to a fault,
it first locks the global lock protecting submitted_jobs (#1).

After the last job is destroyed, it proceeds to release the related context
and locks file_priv (#2). Meanwhile, in the job submission thread,
the file_priv lock (#2) is taken first, and then the submitted_jobs
lock (#1) is obtained when a job is added to the submitted jobs list.

       CPU0                            CPU1
       ----                    	       ----
  (for example due to a fault)         (jobs submissions keep coming)

  lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1
  ivpu_jobs_abort_all()
  job_destroy()
                                      lock(&file_priv->lock)           #2
                                      lock(&vdev->submitted_jobs_lock) #1
  file_priv_release()
  lock(&vdev->context_list_lock)
  lock(&file_priv->lock)           #2

This order of locking causes a deadlock. To resolve this issue,
change the order of locking in ivpu_job_submit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37907 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/079d2622f8c9e0c380149645fff21d35c59ce6ff
