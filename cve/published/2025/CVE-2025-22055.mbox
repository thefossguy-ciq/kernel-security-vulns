Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix geneve_opt length integer overflow

struct geneve_opt uses 5 bit length for each single option, which
means every vary size option should be smaller than 128 bytes.

However, all current related Netlink policies cannot promise this
length condition and the attacker can exploit a exact 128-byte size
option to *fake* a zero length option and confuse the parsing logic,
further achieve heap out-of-bounds read.

One example crash log is like below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
