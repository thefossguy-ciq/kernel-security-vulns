Subject: CVE-2025-39679: drm/nouveau/nvif: Fix potential memory leak in nvif_vmm_ctor().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau/nvif: Fix potential memory leak in nvif_vmm_ctor().

When the nvif_vmm_type is invalid, we will return error directly
without freeing the args in nvif_vmm_ctor(), which leading a memory
leak. Fix it by setting the ret -EINVAL and goto done.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39679 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
