Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix string copying in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()

strscpy_pad() can't be used to copy a non-NUL-term string into a NUL-term
string of possibly bigger size.  Commit 0efc5990bca5 ("string.h: Introduce
memtostr() and memtostr_pad()") provides additional information in that
regard.  So if this happens, the following warning is observed:

strnlen: detected buffer overflow: 65 byte read of buffer size 64

Since userspace is expected to provide s_mount_opts field to be at most 63
characters long with the ending byte being NUL-term, use a 64-byte buffer
which matches the size of s_mount_opts, so that strscpy_pad() does its job
properly.  Return with error if the user still managed to provide a
non-NUL-term string here.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
