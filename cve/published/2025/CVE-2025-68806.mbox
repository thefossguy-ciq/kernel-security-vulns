Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix buffer validation by including null terminator size in EA length

The smb2_set_ea function, which handles Extended Attributes (EA),
was performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly omitted the size
of the null terminating character (+1 byte) for EA Name.
This patch fixes the issue by explicitly adding '+ 1' to EaNameLength where
the null terminator is expected to be present in the buffer, ensuring
the validation accurately reflects the total required buffer size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68806 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
