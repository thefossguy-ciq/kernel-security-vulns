Subject: CVE-2025-38505: wifi: mwifiex: discard erroneous disassoc frames on STA interface

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mwifiex: discard erroneous disassoc frames on STA interface

When operating in concurrent STA/AP mode with host MLME enabled,
the firmware incorrectly sends disassociation frames to the STA
interface when clients disconnect from the AP interface.
This causes kernel warnings as the STA interface processes
disconnect events that don't apply to it:

Add validation in the STA receive path to verify that disassoc/deauth
frames originate from the connected AP. Frames that fail this check
are discarded early, preventing them from reaching the MLME layer and
triggering WARN_ON().

This filtering logic is similar with that used in the
ieee80211_rx_mgmt_disassoc() function in mac80211, which drops
disassoc frames that don't match the current BSSID
(!ether_addr_equal(mgmt->bssid, sdata->vif.cfg.ap_addr)), ensuring
only relevant frames are processed.

Tested on:
- 8997 with FW 16.68.1.p197

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38505 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
