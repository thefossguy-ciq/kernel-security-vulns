Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Do not reprogram affinitiy on ASP chip

The ASP chip is a very old variant of the GSP chip and is used e.g. in
HP 730 workstations. When trying to reprogram the affinity it will crash
with a HPMC as the relevant registers don't seem to be at the usual
location.  Let's avoid the crash by checking the sversion. Also note,
that reprogramming isn't necessary either, as the HP730 is a just a
single-CPU machine.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71121 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
