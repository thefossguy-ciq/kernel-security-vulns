Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/zctx: check chained notif contexts

Send zc only links ubuf_info for requests coming from the same context.
There are some ambiguous syz reports, so let's check the assumption on
notification completion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68317 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
