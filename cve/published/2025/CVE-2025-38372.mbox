Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix unsafe xarray access in implicit ODP handling

__xa_store() and __xa_erase() were used without holding the proper lock,
which led to a lockdep warning due to unsafe RCU usage.  This patch
replaces them with xa_store() and xa_erase(), which perform the necessary
locking internally.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
