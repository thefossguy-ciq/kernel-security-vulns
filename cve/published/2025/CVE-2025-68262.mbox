Subject: CVE-2025-68262: crypto: zstd - fix double-free in per-CPU stream cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: zstd - fix double-free in per-CPU stream cleanup

The crypto/zstd module has a double-free bug that occurs when multiple
tfms are allocated and freed.

The issue happens because zstd_streams (per-CPU contexts) are freed in
zstd_exit() during every tfm destruction, rather than being managed at
the module level.  When multiple tfms exist, each tfm exit attempts to
free the same shared per-CPU streams, resulting in a double-free.

This leads to a stack trace similar to:

  BUG: Bad page state in process kworker/u16:1  pfn:106fd93

Change the lifecycle management of zstd_streams to free the streams only
once during module cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68262 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
