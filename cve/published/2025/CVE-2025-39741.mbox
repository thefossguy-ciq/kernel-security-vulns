Subject: CVE-2025-39741: drm/xe/migrate: don't overflow max copy size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/migrate: don't overflow max copy size

With non-page aligned copy, we need to use 4 byte aligned pitch, however
the size itself might still be close to our maximum of ~8M, and so the
dimensions of the copy can easily exceed the S16_MAX limit of the copy
command leading to the following assert:

xe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] Assertion `size / pitch <= ((s16)(((u16)~0U) >> 1))` failed!
platform: BATTLEMAGE subplatform: 1
graphics: Xe2_HPG 20.01 step A0
media: Xe2_HPM 13.01 step A1
tile: 0 VRAM 10.0 GiB
GT: 0 type 1

WARNING: CPU: 23 PID: 10605 at drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_migrate.c:673 emit_copy+0x4b5/0x4e0 [xe]

To fix this account for the pitch when calculating the number of current
bytes to copy.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7257cc6644d540130a46a61531a07a0517cace89
