Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efivarfs: Fix memory leak of efivarfs_fs_info in fs_context error paths

When processing mount options, efivarfs allocates efivarfs_fs_info (sfi)
early in fs_context initialization. However, sfi is associated with the
superblock and typically freed when the superblock is destroyed. If the
fs_context is released (final put) before fill_super is called—such as
on error paths or during reconfiguration—the sfi structure would leak,
as ownership never transfers to the superblock.

Implement the .free callback in efivarfs_context_ops to ensure any
allocated sfi is properly freed if the fs_context is torn down before
fill_super, preventing this memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38549 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/efivarfs/super.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
