Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

software node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()

software_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element, so
the property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes
but that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check, and may cause OOB
for malformed property.

Fix by using as OOB check '((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38342 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
