Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/kbuf: fix signedness in this_len calculation

When importing and using buffers, buf->len is considered unsigned.
However, buf->len is converted to signed int when committing. This can
lead to unexpected behavior if the buffer is large enough to be
interpreted as a negative value. Make min_t calculation unsigned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39822 to this issue.

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	io_uring/kbuf.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4f411c068402c370c4f9a9d4950a97af97bbbb1
