Subject: CVE-2025-40169: bpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject negative offsets for ALU ops

When verifying BPF programs, the check_alu_op() function validates
instructions with ALU operations. The 'offset' field in these
instructions is a signed 16-bit integer.

The existing check 'insn->off > 1' was intended to ensure the offset is
either 0, or 1 for BPF_MOD/BPF_DIV. However, because 'insn->off' is
signed, this check incorrectly accepts all negative values (e.g., -1).

This commit tightens the validation by changing the condition to
'(insn->off != 0 && insn->off != 1)'. This ensures that any value
other than the explicitly permitted 0 and 1 is rejected, hardening the
verifier against malformed BPF programs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40169 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
