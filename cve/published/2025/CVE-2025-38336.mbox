Subject: CVE-2025-38336: ata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330

The controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system when
doing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on the
device attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.

In this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media
with cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an
Optiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,
running at UDMA/33.

The issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin
build of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause
it. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't
appear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known
workaround exists.

HDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38336 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
