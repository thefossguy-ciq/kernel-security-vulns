Subject: CVE-2025-39680: i2c: rtl9300: Fix out-of-bounds bug in rtl9300_i2c_smbus_xfer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: rtl9300: Fix out-of-bounds bug in rtl9300_i2c_smbus_xfer

The data->block[0] variable comes from user. Without proper check,
the variable may be very large to cause an out-of-bounds bug.

Fix this bug by checking the value of data->block[0] first.

1. commit 39244cc75482 ("i2c: ismt: Fix an out-of-bounds bug in
   ismt_access()")
2. commit 92fbb6d1296f ("i2c: xgene-slimpro: Fix out-of-bounds bug in
   xgene_slimpro_i2c_xfer()")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39680 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
