Subject: CVE-2025-71106: fs: PM: Fix reverse check in filesystems_freeze_callback()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: PM: Fix reverse check in filesystems_freeze_callback()

The freeze_all_ptr check in filesystems_freeze_callback() introduced by
commit a3f8f8662771 ("power: always freeze efivarfs") is reverse which
quite confusingly causes all file systems to be frozen when
filesystem_freeze_enabled is false.

On my systems it causes the WARN_ON_ONCE() in __set_task_frozen() to
trigger, most likely due to an attempt to freeze a file system that is
not ready for that.

Add a logical negation to the check in question to reverse it as
appropriate.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
