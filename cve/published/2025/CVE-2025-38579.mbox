Subject: CVE-2025-38579: f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage

KMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`
 and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.

The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three
fields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the
remaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior
when those fields are accessed later, especially during
extent merging.

Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38579 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
