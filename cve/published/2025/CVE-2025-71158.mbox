Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: mpsse: ensure worker is torn down

When an IRQ worker is running, unplugging the device would cause a
crash. The sealevel hardware this driver was written for was not
hotpluggable, so I never realized it.

This change uses a spinlock to protect a list of workers, which
it tears down on disconnect.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71158 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.18.6 with commit 472d900c8bcac301ae0e40fdca7db799bd989ff5
	Fixed in 6.19-rc1 with commit 179ef1127d7a4f09f0e741fa9f30b8a8e7886271

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2025-71158
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpio/gpio-mpsse.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/472d900c8bcac301ae0e40fdca7db799bd989ff5
