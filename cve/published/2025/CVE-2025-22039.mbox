Subject: CVE-2025-22039: ksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check

The dacloffset field was originally typed as int and used in an
unchecked addition, which could overflow and bypass the existing
bounds check in both smb_check_perm_dacl() and smb_inherit_dacl().

This could result in out-of-bounds memory access and a kernel crash
when dereferencing the DACL pointer.

This patch converts dacloffset to unsigned int and uses
check_add_overflow() to validate access to the DACL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
