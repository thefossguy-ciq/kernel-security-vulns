Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rv: Use strings in da monitors tracepoints

Using DA monitors tracepoints with KASAN enabled triggers the following
warning:

 BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0xd6/0x1a0
 Read of size 32 at addr ffffffffaada8980 by task ...
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
 [...]
  do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0xd6/0x1a0
  ? __pfx_do_trace_event_raw_event_event_da_monitor+0x10/0x10
  ? trace_event_sncid+0x83/0x200
  trace_event_sncid+0x163/0x200
 [...]
 The buggy address belongs to the variable:
  automaton_snep+0x4e0/0x5e0

This is caused by the tracepoints reading 32 bytes __array instead of
__string from the automata definition. Such strings are literals and
reading 32 bytes ends up in out of bound memory accesses (e.g. the next
automaton's data in this case).
The error is harmless as, while printing the string, we stop at the null
terminator, but it should still be fixed.

Use the __string facilities while defining the tracepoints to avoid
reading out of bound memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38636 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ebc70d973ce7a81826b5c4f55f743e07f5864d9
