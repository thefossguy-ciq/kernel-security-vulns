=====================================================

The HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():

HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);

Finally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()
doesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains
only zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.
But if the allocated memory contains the "garbage", then
it can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers
the reported issue.

This patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()
with the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.
Because, newly created allocation bitmap should have all
available blocks free. Potentially, initialization bitmap's read
operation could not fill the whole allocated memory and
"garbage" in the not initialized memory will be the reason of
volume coruptions and file system driver bugs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40243 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
