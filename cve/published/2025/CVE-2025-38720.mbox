Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hibmcge: fix rtnl deadlock issue

Currently, the hibmcge netdev acquires the rtnl_lock in
pci_error_handlers.reset_prepare() and releases it in
pci_error_handlers.reset_done().

However, in the PCI framework:
pci_reset_bus - __pci_reset_slot - pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked -
 pci_dev_save_and_disable - err_handler->reset_prepare(dev);

In pci_slot_save_and_disable_locked():
	list_for_each_entry(dev, &slot->bus->devices, bus_list) {
		if (!dev->slot || dev->slot!= slot)
			continue;
		pci_dev_save_and_disable(dev);
		if (dev->subordinate)
			pci_bus_save_and_disable_locked(dev->subordinate);
	}

This will iterate through all devices under the current bus and execute
err_handler->reset_prepare(), causing two devices of the hibmcge driver
to sequentially request the rtnl_lock, leading to a deadlock.

Since the driver now executes netif_device_detach()
before the reset process, it will not concurrently with
other netdev APIs, so there is no need to hold the rtnl_lock now.

Therefore, this patch removes the rtnl_lock during the reset process and
adjusts the position of HBG_NIC_STATE_RESETTING to ensure
that multiple resets are not executed concurrently.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38720 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
