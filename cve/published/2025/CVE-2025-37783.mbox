Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check

The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers
returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This
could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.

This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is
valid before dereferencing them.

Similar to commit da29abe71e16
("drm/amd/display: Fix error pointers in amdgpu_dm_crtc_mem_type_changed").

	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/dpu1/dpu_plane.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9670ed1cce3216778c89936d3ae91cf0d436035
