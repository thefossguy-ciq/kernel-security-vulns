Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: pidff: Fix null pointer dereference in pidff_find_fields

This function triggered a null pointer dereference if used to search for
a report that isn't implemented on the device. This happened both for
optional and required reports alike.

The same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and although
pidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the required
reports is missing, future modifications could change this logic and
resurface this possible null pointer dereference again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37862 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
