Subject: CVE-2025-38544: rxrpc: Fix bug due to prealloc collision

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix bug due to prealloc collision

When userspace is using AF_RXRPC to provide a server, it has to preallocate
incoming calls and assign to them call IDs that will be used to thread
related recvmsg() and sendmsg() together.  The preallocated call IDs will
automatically be attached to calls as they come in until the pool is empty.

To the kernel, the call IDs are just arbitrary numbers, but userspace can
use the call ID to hold a pointer to prepared structs.  In any case, the
user isn't permitted to create two calls with the same call ID (call IDs
become available again when the call ends) and EBADSLT should result from
sendmsg() if an attempt is made to preallocate a call with an in-use call
ID.

However, the cleanup in the error handling will trigger both assertions in
rxrpc_cleanup_call() because the call isn't marked complete and isn't
marked as having been released.

Fix this by setting the call state in rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() and then
marking it as being released before calling the cleanup function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38544 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
