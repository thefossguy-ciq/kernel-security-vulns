Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/vf: Don't try to trigger a full GT reset if VF

VFs don't have access to the GDRST(0x941c) register that driver
uses to reset a GT. Attempt to trigger a reset using debugfs:

 $ cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.1/gt0/force_reset

or due to a hang condition detected by the driver leads to:

 [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] GT0: trying reset from force_reset [xe]
 [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] GT0: reset queued
 [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] GT0: reset started

Fix that by sending H2G VF_RESET(0x5507) action instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23162 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
