Subject: CVE-2025-38119: scsi: core: ufs: Fix a hang in the error handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: ufs: Fix a hang in the error handler

ufshcd_err_handling_prepare() calls ufshcd_rpm_get_sync(). The latter
function can only succeed if UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS is not set because
resuming involves submitting a SCSI command and ufshcd_queuecommand()
returns SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY if UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS is set. Fix this
hang by setting UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS after ufshcd_rpm_get_sync() has
been called instead of before.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
