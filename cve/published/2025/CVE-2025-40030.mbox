Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: check the return value of pinmux_ops::get_function_name()

While the API contract in docs doesn't specify it explicitly, the
generic implementation of the get_function_name() callback from struct
pinmux_ops - pinmux_generic_get_function_name() - can fail and return
NULL. This is already checked in pinmux_check_ops() so add a similar
check in pinmux_func_name_to_selector() instead of passing the returned
pointer right down to strcmp() where the NULL can get dereferenced. This
is normal operation when adding new pinfunctions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
