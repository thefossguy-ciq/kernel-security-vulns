Subject: CVE-2025-71092: RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()

Commit ef56081d1864 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters
update") added three new counters and placed them after
BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.

BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware
statistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.

As a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating
hw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in
bnxt_re_copy_err_stats().

The counters BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and
BNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable to generic hardware, not
only p5/p7 devices.

Fix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR so they
are included in the generic counter set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
