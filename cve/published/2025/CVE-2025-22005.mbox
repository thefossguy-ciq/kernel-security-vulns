Subject: CVE-2025-22005: ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh->nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh->rt6i_pcpu, resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
