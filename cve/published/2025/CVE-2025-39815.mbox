Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RISC-V: KVM: fix stack overrun when loading vlenb

The userspace load can put up to 2048 bits into an xlen bit stack
buffer.  We want only xlen bits, so check the size beforehand.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c76bf8359188a11f8fd790e5bbd6077894a245cc
