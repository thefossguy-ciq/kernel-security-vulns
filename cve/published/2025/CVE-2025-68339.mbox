Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm/fore200e: Fix possible data race in fore200e_open()

Protect access to fore200e->available_cell_rate with rate_mtx lock in the
error handling path of fore200e_open() to prevent a data race.

The field fore200e->available_cell_rate is a shared resource used to track
available bandwidth. It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(),
fore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().

In fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting
vcc->qos.txtp.max_pcr from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth.
However, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin() fails, the
function restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to
available_cell_rate without holding the lock.

This introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is a global
device resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in
fore200e_open() executes concurrently with operations like
fore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs, a
read-modify-write race occurs.

Specifically, the error path reads the rate without the lock. If another
CPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in
fore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error
path will overwrite the concurrent update with a stale value. This results
in incorrect bandwidth accounting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68339 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
