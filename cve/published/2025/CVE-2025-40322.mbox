Subject: CVE-2025-40322: fbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: bitblit: bound-check glyph index in bit_putcs*

bit_putcs_aligned()/unaligned() derived the glyph pointer from the
character value masked by 0xff/0x1ff, which may exceed the actual font's
glyph count and read past the end of the built-in font array.
Clamp the index to the actual glyph count before computing the address.

This fixes a global out-of-bounds read reported by syzbot.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40322 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
