Subject: CVE-2025-68792: tpm2-sessions: Fix out of range indexing in name_size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm2-sessions: Fix out of range indexing in name_size

'name_size' does not have any range checks, and it just directly indexes
with TPM_ALG_ID, which could lead into memory corruption at worst.

Address the issue by only processing known values and returning -EINVAL for
unrecognized values.

Make also 'tpm_buf_append_name' and 'tpm_buf_fill_hmac_session' fallible so
that errors are detected before causing any spurious TPM traffic.

End also the authorization session on failure in both of the functions, as
the session state would be then by definition corrupted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68792 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
