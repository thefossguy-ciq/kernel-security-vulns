Subject: CVE-2025-38494: HID: core: do not bypass hid_hw_raw_request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: core: do not bypass hid_hw_raw_request

hid_hw_raw_request() is actually useful to ensure the provided buffer
and length are valid. Directly calling in the low level transport driver
function bypassed those checks and allowed invalid paramto be used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38494 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
