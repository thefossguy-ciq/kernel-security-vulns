Subject: CVE-2025-68779: net/mlx5e: Avoid unregistering PSP twice

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Avoid unregistering PSP twice

PSP is unregistered twice in:
_mlx5e_remove -> mlx5e_psp_unregister
mlx5e_nic_cleanup -> mlx5e_psp_unregister

This leads to a refcount underflow in some conditions:
------------[ cut here ]------------
refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1694 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xd8/0xe0

Do not directly remove psp from the _mlx5e_remove path, the PSP cleanup
happens as part of profile cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68779 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e12c912f92ccea671b514caf371f28485714bb4b
