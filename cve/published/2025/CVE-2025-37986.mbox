Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: class: Invalidate USB device pointers on partner unregistration

To avoid using invalid USB device pointers after a Type-C partner
disconnects, this patch clears the pointers upon partner unregistration.
This ensures a clean state for future connections.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37986 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
