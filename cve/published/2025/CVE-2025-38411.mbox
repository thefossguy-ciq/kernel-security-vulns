Subject: CVE-2025-38411: netfs: Fix double put of request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix double put of request

If a netfs request finishes during the pause loop, it will have the ref
that belongs to the IN_PROGRESS flag removed at that point - however, if it
then goes to the final wait loop, that will *also* put the ref because it
sees that the IN_PROGRESS flag is clear and incorrectly assumes that this
happened when it called the collector.

In fact, since IN_PROGRESS is clear, we shouldn't call the collector again
since it's done all the cleanup, such as calling ->ki_complete().

Fix this by making netfs_collect_in_app() just return, indicating that
we're done if IN_PROGRESS is removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38411 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/netfs/misc.c
	include/trace/events/netfs.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d18facba5a5795ad44b2a00a052e3db2fa77ab12
