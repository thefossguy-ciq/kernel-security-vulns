Subject: CVE-2025-38609: PM / devfreq: Check governor before using governor->name

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM / devfreq: Check governor before using governor->name

Commit 96ffcdf239de ("PM / devfreq: Remove redundant governor_name from
struct devfreq") removes governor_name and uses governor->name to replace
it. But devfreq->governor may be NULL and directly using
devfreq->governor->name may cause null pointer exception. Move the check of
governor to before using governor->name.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38609 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
