Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix error code in chan_alloc_skb_cb()

The chan_alloc_skb_cb() function is supposed to return error pointers on
error.  Returning NULL will lead to a NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22007 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
