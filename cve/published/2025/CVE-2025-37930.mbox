Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: Fix WARN_ON in nouveau_fence_context_kill()

Nouveau is mostly designed in a way that it's expected that fences only
ever get signaled through nouveau_fence_signal(). However, in at least
one other place, nouveau_fence_done(), can signal fences, too. If that
happens (race) a signaled fence remains in the pending list for a while,
until it gets removed by nouveau_fence_update().

Should nouveau_fence_context_kill() run in the meantime, this would be
a bug because the function would attempt to set an error code on an
already signaled fence.

Have nouveau_fence_context_kill() check for a fence being signaled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
