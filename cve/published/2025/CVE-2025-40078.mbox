Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Explicitly check accesses to bpf_sock_addr

Syzkaller found a kernel warning on the following sock_addr program:

    0: r0 = 0
    1: r2 = *(u32 *)(r1 +60)
    2: exit

which triggers:

    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion (0)

This is happening because offset 60 in bpf_sock_addr corresponds to an
implicit padding of 4 bytes, right after msg_src_ip4. Access to this
padding isn't rejected in sock_addr_is_valid_access and it thus later
fails to convert the access.

This patch fixes it by explicitly checking the various fields of
bpf_sock_addr in sock_addr_is_valid_access.

I checked the other ctx structures and is_valid_access functions and
didn't find any other similar cases. Other cases of (properly handled)
padding are covered in new tests in a subsequent patch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
