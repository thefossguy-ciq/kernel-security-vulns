Subject: CVE-2025-37765: drm/nouveau: prime: fix ttm_bo_delayed_delete oops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: prime: fix ttm_bo_delayed_delete oops

Fix an oops in ttm_bo_delayed_delete which results from dererencing a
dangling pointer:

The cause of this is:

- drm_prime_gem_destroy calls dma_buf_put(dma_buf) which releases the
  reference to the shared dma_buf. The reference count is 0, so the
  dma_buf is destroyed, which in turn decrements the corresponding
  amdgpu_bo reference count to 0, and the amdgpu_bo is destroyed -
  calling drm_gem_object_release then dma_resv_fini (which destroys the
  reservation object), then finally freeing the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_bo obj->bo.base.resv is now a dangling pointer to the memory
  formerly allocated to the amdgpu_bo.

- nouveau_gem_object_del calls ttm_bo_put(&nvbo->bo) which calls
  ttm_bo_release, which schedules ttm_bo_delayed_delete.

- ttm_bo_delayed_delete runs and dereferences the dangling resv pointer,
  resulting in a general protection fault.

Fix this by moving the drm_prime_gem_destroy call from
nouveau_gem_object_del to nouveau_bo_del_ttm. This ensures that it will
be run after ttm_bo_delayed_delete.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37765 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
