Subject: CVE-2025-38374: optee: ffa: fix sleep in atomic context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

optee: ffa: fix sleep in atomic context

The OP-TEE driver registers the function notif_callback() for FF-A
notifications. However, this function is called in an atomic context
leading to errors like this when processing asynchronous notifications:

 | BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:258
 | in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 9, name: kworker/0:0

 | CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 9 Comm: kworker/0:0 Not tainted 6.14.0-00019-g657536ebe0aa #13
 | Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)

Fix this by adding work queue to process the notification in a
non-atomic context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38374 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
