Subject: CVE-2025-37744: wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_pci_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_pci_remove()

Kmemleak reported this error:

  unreferenced object 0xffff1c165cec3060 (size 32):
    comm "insmod", pid 560, jiffies 4296964570 (age 235.596s)
    backtrace:

      [<0000000087184c94>] really_probe+0x150/0x2c0

The firmware memory was allocated in ath12k_pci_probe(), but not
freed in ath12k_pci_remove() in case ATH12K_FLAG_QMI_FAIL bit is
set. So call ath12k_fw_unmap() to free the memory.

Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.2.0-02280-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-1

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
