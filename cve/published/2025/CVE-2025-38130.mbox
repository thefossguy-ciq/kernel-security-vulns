Subject: CVE-2025-38130: drm/connector: only call HDMI audio helper plugged cb if non-null

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/connector: only call HDMI audio helper plugged cb if non-null

On driver remove, sound/soc/codecs/hdmi-codec.c calls the plugged_cb
with NULL as the callback function and codec_dev, as seen in its
hdmi_remove function.

The HDMI audio helper then happily tries calling said null function
pointer, and produces an Oops as a result.

Fix this by only executing the callback if fn is non-null. This means
the .plugged_cb and .plugged_cb_dev members still get appropriately
cleared.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
