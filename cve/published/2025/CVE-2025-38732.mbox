Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_reject: don't leak dst refcount for loopback packets

recent patches to add a WARN() when replacing skb dst entry found an
old bug:

WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 skb_dst_check_unset include/linux/skbuff.h:1164 [inline]
WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 skb_dst_set include/linux/skbuff.h:1210 [inline]
WARNING: include/linux/skbuff.h:1165 nf_reject_fill_skb_dst+0x2a4/0x330 net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv4.c:234
[..]
Call Trace:
 nf_send_unreach+0x17b/0x6e0 net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv4.c:325
 nft_reject_inet_eval+0x4bc/0x690 net/netfilter/nft_reject_inet.c:27
 expr_call_ops_eval net/netfilter/nf_tables_core.c:237 [inline]
 ..

This is because blamed commit forgot about loopback packets.
Such packets already have a dst_entry attached, even at PRE_ROUTING stage.

Instead of checking hook just check if the skb already has a route
attached to it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38732 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
