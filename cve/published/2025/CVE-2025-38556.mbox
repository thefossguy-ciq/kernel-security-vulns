Subject: CVE-2025-38556: HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits

Testing by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a
shift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit
quantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but
there are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size
set to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because
of that.

Instead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable
result instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits
set to 0 -- the same as what snto32() does.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38556 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
