Subject: CVE-2025-21990: drm/amdgpu: NULL-check BO's backing store when determining GFX12 PTE flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: NULL-check BO's backing store when determining GFX12 PTE flags

PRT BOs may not have any backing store, so bo->tbo.resource will be
NULL. Check for that before dereferencing.

(cherry picked from commit 3e3fcd29b505cebed659311337ea03b7698767fc)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21990 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
