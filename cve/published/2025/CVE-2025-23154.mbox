Subject: CVE-2025-23154: io_uring/net: fix io_req_post_cqe abuse by send bundle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/net: fix io_req_post_cqe abuse by send bundle

[  114.987980][ T5313] WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 5313 at io_uring/io_uring.c:872 io_req_post_cqe+0x12e/0x4f0
[  114.991597][ T5313] RIP: 0010:io_req_post_cqe+0x12e/0x4f0

As the comment states, io_req_post_cqe() should only be used by
multishot requests, i.e. REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT, which bundled sends are
not. Add a flag signifying whether a request wants to post multiple
CQEs. Eventually REQ_F_APOLL_MULTISHOT should imply the new flag, but
that's left out for simplicity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23154 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
