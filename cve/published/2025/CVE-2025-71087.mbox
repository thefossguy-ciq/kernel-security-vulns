Subject: CVE-2025-71087: iavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()

There are off-by-one bugs when configuring RSS hash key and lookup
table, causing out-of-bounds reads to memory [1] and out-of-bounds
writes to device registers.

Before commit 43a3d9ba34c9 ("i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS"),
the loop upper bounds were:
    i <= I40E_VFQF_{HKEY,HLUT}_MAX_INDEX
which is safe since the value is the last valid index.

That commit changed the bounds to:
    i <= adapter->rss_{key,lut}_size / 4
where `rss_{key,lut}_size / 4` is the number of dwords, so the last
valid index is `(rss_{key,lut}_size / 4) - 1`. Therefore, using `<=`
accesses one element past the end.

Fix the issues by using `<` instead of `<=`, ensuring we do not exceed
the bounds.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
