Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: KVM: Check validity of "num_cpu" from user space

The maximum supported cpu number is EIOINTC_ROUTE_MAX_VCPUS about
irqchip EIOINTC, here add validation about cpu number to avoid array
pointer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38366 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
