Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netmem: prevent TX of unreadable skbs

Currently on stable trees we have support for netmem/devmem RX but not
TX. It is not safe to forward/redirect an RX unreadable netmem packet
into the device's TX path, as the device may call dma-mapping APIs on
dma addrs that should not be passed to it.

Fix this by preventing the xmit of unreadable skbs.

Tested by configuring tc redirect:

sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 ingress
sudo tc filter add dev eth1 ingress protocol ip prio 1 flower ip_proto \
	tcp src_ip 192.168.1.12 action mirred egress redirect dev eth1

Before, I see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs.

After, I don't see unreadable skbs in the driver's TX path passed to dma
mapping APIs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/454825019d2f0c59e5174ece9e713f45ad80beff
