Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath12k_pci_free_irq() in error path

If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the
IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in
ath12k_pci_msi_alloc(). This does no harm unless one of the functions
requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ.

This may end up with a warning from the IRQ core that is expecting the
affinity hint to be cleared before freeing the IRQ:

kernel/irq/manage.c:

	/* make sure affinity_hint is cleaned up */
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(desc->affinity_hint))
		desc->affinity_hint = NULL;

So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling
ath12k_pci_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once
again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does
no harm.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22128 to this issue.

	drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/pci.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35b33ba76765ce9e72949d957f3cf1feafd2955c
