Subject: CVE-2025-71157: RDMA/core: always drop device refcount in ib_del_sub_device_and_put()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: always drop device refcount in ib_del_sub_device_and_put()

Since nldev_deldev() (introduced by commit 060c642b2ab8 ("RDMA/nldev: Add
support to add/delete a sub IB device through netlink") grabs a reference
using ib_device_get_by_index() before calling ib_del_sub_device_and_put(),
we need to drop that reference before returning -EOPNOTSUPP error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71157 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
