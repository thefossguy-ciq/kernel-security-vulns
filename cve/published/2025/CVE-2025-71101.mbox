Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix out-of-bounds array access in ACPI package parsing

The hp_populate_*_elements_from_package() functions in the hp-bioscfg
driver contain out-of-bounds array access vulnerabilities.

These functions parse ACPI packages into internal data structures using
a for loop with index variable 'elem' that iterates through
enum_obj/integer_obj/order_obj/password_obj/string_obj arrays.

When processing multi-element fields like PREREQUISITES and
ENUM_POSSIBLE_VALUES, these functions read multiple consecutive array
elements using expressions like 'enum_obj[elem + reqs]' and
'enum_obj[elem + pos_values]' within nested loops.

The bug is that the bounds check only validated elem, but did not consider
the additional offset when accessing elem + reqs or elem + pos_values.

The fix changes the bounds check to validate the actual accessed index.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
