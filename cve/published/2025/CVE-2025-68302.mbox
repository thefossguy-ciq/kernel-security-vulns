Subject: CVE-2025-68302: net: sxgbe: fix potential NULL dereference in sxgbe_rx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sxgbe: fix potential NULL dereference in sxgbe_rx()

Currently, when skb is null, the driver prints an error and then
dereferences skb on the next line.

To fix this, let's add a 'break' after the error message to switch
to sxgbe_rx_refill(), which is similar to the approach taken by the
other drivers in this particular case, e.g. calxeda with xgmac_rx().

Found during a code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68302 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
