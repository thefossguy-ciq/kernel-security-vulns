Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget

In the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget
structure (pdev->gadget) was freed before its endpoints.
The endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.
Freeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.
When the endpoints are subsequently freed, this results in a use-after-free.

Fix:
By separating the usb_del_gadget_udc() operation into distinct "del" and
"put" steps, cdnsp_gadget_free_endpoints() can be executed prior to the
final release of the gadget structure with usb_put_gadget().

A patch similar to bb9c74a5bd14("usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure
 only after freeing endpoints").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40314 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
