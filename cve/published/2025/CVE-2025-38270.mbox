Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: drv: netdevsim: don't napi_complete() from netpoll

netdevsim supports netpoll. Make sure we don't call napi_complete()
from it, since it may not be scheduled. Breno reports hitting a
warning in napi_complete_done():

WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 104 at net/core/dev.c:6592 napi_complete_done+0x2cc/0x560
  __napi_poll+0x2d8/0x3a0
  handle_softirqs+0x1fe/0x710

This is presumably after netpoll stole the SCHED bit prematurely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38270 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
