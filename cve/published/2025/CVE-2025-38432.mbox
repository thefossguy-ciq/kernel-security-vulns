Subject: CVE-2025-38432: net: netpoll: Initialize UDP checksum field before checksumming

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netpoll: Initialize UDP checksum field before checksumming

commit f1fce08e63fe ("netpoll: Eliminate redundant assignment") removed
the initialization of the UDP checksum, which was wrong and broke
netpoll IPv6 transmission due to bad checksumming.

udph->check needs to be set before calling csum_ipv6_magic().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38432 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
