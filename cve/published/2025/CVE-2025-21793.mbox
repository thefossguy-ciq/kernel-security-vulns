Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: sn-f-ospi: Fix division by zero

When there is no dummy cycle in the spi-nor commands, both dummy bus cycle
bytes and width are zero. Because of the cpu's warning when divided by
zero, the warning should be avoided. Return just zero to avoid such
calculations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21793 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
