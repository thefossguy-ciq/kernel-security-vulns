Subject: CVE-2025-68731: accel/amdxdna: Fix an integer overflow in aie2_query_ctx_status_array()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/amdxdna: Fix an integer overflow in aie2_query_ctx_status_array()

The unpublished smatch static checker reported a warning.

drivers/accel/amdxdna/aie2_pci.c:904 aie2_query_ctx_status_array()
warn: potential user controlled sizeof overflow
'args->num_element * args->element_size' '1-u32max(user) * 1-u32max(user)'

Even this will not cause a real issue, it is better to put a reasonable
limitation for element_size and num_element. Add condition to make sure
the input element_size <= 4K and num_element <= 1K.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
