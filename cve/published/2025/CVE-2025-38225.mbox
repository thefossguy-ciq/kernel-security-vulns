Subject: CVE-2025-38225: media: imx-jpeg: Cleanup after an allocation error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Cleanup after an allocation error

When allocation failures are not cleaned up by the driver, further
allocation errors will be false-positives, which will cause buffers to
remain uninitialized and cause NULL pointer dereferences.
Ensure proper cleanup of failed allocations to prevent these issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38225 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
