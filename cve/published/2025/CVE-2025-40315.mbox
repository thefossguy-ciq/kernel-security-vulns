Subject: CVE-2025-40315: usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.

A race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently
with ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()
sets ffs->epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs->eps_count to 0, leading
to a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile->ep in
ffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().

The ffs->epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and
ffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the
spinlock ffs->eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function
is also protected by ffs->eps_lock.

Thus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs->epfiles in the
ffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix issues

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40315 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
