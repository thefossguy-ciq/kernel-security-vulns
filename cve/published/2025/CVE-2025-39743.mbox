Subject: CVE-2025-39743: jfs: truncate good inode pages when hard link is 0

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: truncate good inode pages when hard link is 0

The fileset value of the inode copy from the disk by the reproducer is
AGGR_RESERVED_I. When executing evict, its hard link number is 0, so its
inode pages are not truncated. This causes the bugon to be triggered when
executing clear_inode() because nrpages is greater than 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39743 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
