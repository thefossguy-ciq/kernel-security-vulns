Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/amd_nb: Use rdmsr_safe() in amd_get_mmconfig_range()

Xen doesn't offer MSR_FAM10H_MMIO_CONF_BASE to all guests.  This results
in the following warning:

  unchecked MSR access error: RDMSR from 0xc0010058 at rIP: 0xffffffff8101d19f (xen_do_read_msr+0x7f/0xa0)
  Call Trace:

   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50

based on quirks for a "PNP0c01" device.  Treating MMCFG as disabled is the
right course of action, so no change is needed there.

This was most likely exposed by fixing the Xen MSR accessors to not be
silently-safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21913 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
