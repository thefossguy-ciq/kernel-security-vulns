               "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nafs: Fix delayed allocation of a cell's anonymous key\n\nThe allocation of a cell's anonymous key is done in a background thread\nalong with other cell setup such as doing a DNS upcall.  In the reported\nbug, this is triggered by afs_parse_source() parsing the device name given\nto mount() and calling afs_lookup_cell() with the name of the cell.\n\nThe normal key lookup then tries to use the key description on the\nanonymous authentication key as the reference for request_key() - but it\nmay not yet be set and so an oops can happen.\n\nThis has been made more likely to happen by the fix for dynamic lookup\nfailure.\n\nFix this by firstly allocating a reference name and attaching it to the\nafs_cell record when the record is created.  It can share the memory\nallocation with the cell name (unfortunately it can't just overlap the cell\nname by prepending it with \"afs@\" as the cell name already has a '.'\nprepended for other purposes).  This reference name is then passed to\nrequest_key().\n\nSecondly, the anon key is now allocated on demand at the point a key is\nrequested in afs_request_key() if it is not already allocated.  A mutex is\nused to prevent multiple allocation for a cell.\n\nThirdly, make afs_request_key_rcu() return NULL if the anonymous key isn't\nyet allocated (if we need it) and then the caller can return -ECHILD to\ndrop out of RCU-mode and afs_request_key() can be called.\n\nNote that the anonymous key is kind of necessary to make the key lookup\ncache work as that doesn't currently cache a negative lookup, but it's\nprobably worth some investigation to see if NULL can be used instead."
