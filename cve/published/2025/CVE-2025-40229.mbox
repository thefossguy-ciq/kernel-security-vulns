Subject: CVE-2025-40229: mm/damon/core: fix potential memory leak by cleaning ops_filter in damon_destroy_scheme

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/core: fix potential memory leak by cleaning ops_filter in damon_destroy_scheme

Currently, damon_destroy_scheme() only cleans up the filter list but
leaves ops_filter untouched, which could lead to memory leaks when a
scheme is destroyed.

This patch ensures both filter and ops_filter are properly freed in
damon_destroy_scheme(), preventing potential memory leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40229 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
