Subject: CVE-2025-38310: seg6: Fix validation of nexthop addresses

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seg6: Fix validation of nexthop addresses

The kernel currently validates that the length of the provided nexthop
address does not exceed the specified length. This can lead to the
kernel reading uninitialized memory if user space provided a shorter
length than the specified one.

Fix by validating that the provided length exactly matches the specified
one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38310 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
