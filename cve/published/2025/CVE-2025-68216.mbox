Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: BPF: Disable trampoline for kernel module function trace

The current LoongArch BPF trampoline implementation is incompatible
with tracing functions in kernel modules. This causes several severe
and user-visible problems:

* The `bpf_selftests/module_attach` test fails consistently.
* Kernel lockup when a BPF program is attached to a module function [1].
* Critical kernel modules like WireGuard experience traffic disruption
  when their functions are traced with fentry [2].

Given the severity and the potential for other unknown side-effects, it
is safest to disable the feature entirely for now. This patch prevents
the BPF subsystem from allowing trampoline attachments to kernel module
functions on LoongArch.

This is a temporary mitigation until the core issues in the trampoline
code for kernel module handling can be identified and fixed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/44eb3849378be5f72b8be03edbacbdcd6f5eade4
