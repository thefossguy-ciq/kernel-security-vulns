Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: qup: jump out of the loop in case of timeout

Original logic only sets the return value but doesn't jump out of the
loop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. A
malicious or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case and
should be avoided. This is observed during a long time test with a
PCA953x GPIO extender.

Fix it by changing the logic to not only sets the return value, but also
jumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
