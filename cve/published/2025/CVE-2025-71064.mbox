Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources

Currently, hdev->htqp is allocated using hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp
is allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps is set to
min(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller
than hdev->num_tqps, which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain
uninitialized in hclgevf_knic_setup().

Thus, this patch allocates hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp using hdev->num_tqps,
ensuring that the lengths of hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp are consistent
and that all elements are properly initialized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71064 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6cd8a2930df850f4600fe8c57d0662b376520281
