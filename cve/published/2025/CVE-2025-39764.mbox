Subject: CVE-2025-39764: netfilter: ctnetlink: remove refcounting in expectation dumpers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ctnetlink: remove refcounting in expectation dumpers

Same pattern as previous patch: do not keep the expectation object
alive via refcount, only store a cookie value and then use that
as the skip hint for dump resumption.

AFAICS this has the same issue as the one resolved in the conntrack
dumper, when we do
  if (!refcount_inc_not_zero(&exp->use))

to increment the refcount, there is a chance that exp == last, which
causes a double-increment of the refcount and subsequent memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39764 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
