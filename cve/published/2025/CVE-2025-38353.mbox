Subject: CVE-2025-38353: drm/xe: Fix taking invalid lock on wedge

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix taking invalid lock on wedge

If device wedges on e.g. GuC upload, the submission is not yet enabled
and the state is not even initialized. Protect the wedge call so it does
nothing in this case. It fixes the following splat:

	[] xe 0000:bf:00.0: [drm] device wedged, needs recovery
	[] ------------[ cut here ]------------
	[] DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(lock->magic != lock)
	[] WARNING: CPU: 48 PID: 312 at kernel/locking/mutex.c:564 __mutex_lock+0x8a1/0xe60
	...
	[] RIP: 0010:__mutex_lock+0x8a1/0xe60
	[]  mutex_lock_nested+0x1b/0x30
	[]  xe_guc_submit_wedge+0x80/0x2b0 [xe]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38353 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
