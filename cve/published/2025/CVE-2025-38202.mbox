Subject: CVE-2025-38202: bpf: Check rcu_read_lock_trace_held() in bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check rcu_read_lock_trace_held() in bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem()

bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem() helper is also available for sleepable bpf
program. When BPF JIT is disabled or under 32-bit host,
bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem() will not be inlined. Using it in a
sleepable bpf program will trigger the warning in
bpf_map_lookup_percpu_elem(), because the bpf program only holds
rcu_read_lock_trace lock. Therefore, add the missed check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
