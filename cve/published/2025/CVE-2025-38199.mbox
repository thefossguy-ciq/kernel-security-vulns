Subject: CVE-2025-38199: wifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak due to multiple rx_stats allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak due to multiple rx_stats allocation

rx_stats for each arsta is allocated when adding a station.
arsta->rx_stats will be freed when a station is removed.

Redundant allocations are occurring when the same station is added
multiple times. This causes ath12k_mac_station_add() to be called
multiple times, and rx_stats is allocated each time. As a result there
is memory leaks.

Prevent multiple allocations of rx_stats when ath12k_mac_station_add()
is called repeatedly by checking if rx_stats is already allocated
before allocating again. Allocate arsta->rx_stats if arsta->rx_stats
is NULL respectively.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38199 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
