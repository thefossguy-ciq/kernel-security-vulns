Subject: CVE-2025-71228: LoongArch: Set correct protection_map[] for VM_NONE/VM_SHARED

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Set correct protection_map[] for VM_NONE/VM_SHARED

For 32BIT platform _PAGE_PROTNONE is 0, so set a VMA to be VM_NONE or
VM_SHARED will make pages non-present, then cause Oops with kernel page
fault.

Fix it by set correct protection_map[] for VM_NONE/VM_SHARED, replacing
_PAGE_PROTNONE with _PAGE_PRESENT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
