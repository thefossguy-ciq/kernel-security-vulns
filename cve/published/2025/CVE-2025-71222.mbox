Subject: CVE-2025-71222: wifi: wlcore: ensure skb headroom before skb_push

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wlcore: ensure skb headroom before skb_push

This avoids occasional skb_under_panic Oops from wl1271_tx_work. In this case, headroom is
less than needed (typically 110 - 94 = 16 bytes).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
