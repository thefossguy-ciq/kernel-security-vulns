Subject: CVE-2025-38608: bpf, ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data() in ktls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data() in ktls

When sending plaintext data, we initially calculated the corresponding
ciphertext length. However, if we later reduced the plaintext data length
via socket policy, we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.

This results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data during
ciphertext transmission.

This causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete
"Application Data" packet, leading to errors on the receiving end when
parsing TLS record.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38608 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
