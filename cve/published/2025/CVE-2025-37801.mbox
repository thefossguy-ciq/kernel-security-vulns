spi_imx->rx and spi_imx->tx function pointer can be NULL when
spi_imx_setupxfer() return error, and make NULL pointer dereference.

 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
