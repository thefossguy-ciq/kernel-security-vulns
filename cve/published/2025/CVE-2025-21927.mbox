Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-tcp: fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()

nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn't check the validity of the header length.
When header digests are enabled, a target might send a packet with an
invalid header length (e.g. 255), causing nvme_tcp_verify_hdgst()
to access memory outside the allocated area and cause memory corruptions
by overwriting it with the calculated digest.

Fix this by rejecting packets with an unexpected header length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21927 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fbc953d6b38bc824392e01850f0aeee3b348722
