Subject: CVE-2025-71191: dmaengine: at_hdmac: fix device leak on of_dma_xlate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: at_hdmac: fix device leak on of_dma_xlate()

Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking up the DMA platform
device during of_dma_xlate() when releasing channel resources.

Note that commit 3832b78b3ec2 ("dmaengine: at_hdmac: add missing
put_device() call in at_dma_xlate()") fixed the leak in a couple of
error paths but the reference is still leaking on successful allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
