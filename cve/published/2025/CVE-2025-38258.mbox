Subject: CVE-2025-38258: mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write

memcg_path_store() assigns a newly allocated memory buffer to
filter->memcg_path, without deallocating the previously allocated and
assigned memory buffer.  As a result, users can leak kernel memory by
continuously writing a data to memcg_path DAMOS sysfs file.  Fix the leak
by deallocating the previously set memory buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38258 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
