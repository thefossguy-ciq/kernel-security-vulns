Subject: CVE-2025-38550: ipv6: mcast: Delay put pmc->idev in mld_del_delrec()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: Delay put pmc->idev in mld_del_delrec()

pmc->idev is still used in ip6_mc_clear_src(), so as mld_clear_delrec()
does, the reference should be put after ip6_mc_clear_src() return.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38550 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
