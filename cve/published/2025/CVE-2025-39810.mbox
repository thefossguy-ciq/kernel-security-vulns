Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix memory corruption when FW resources change during ifdown

bnxt_set_dflt_rings() assumes that it is always called before any TC has
been created.  So it doesn't take bp->num_tc into account and assumes
that it is always 0 or 1.

In the FW resource or capability change scenario, the FW will return
flags in bnxt_hwrm_if_change() that will cause the driver to
reinitialize and call bnxt_cancel_reservations().  This will lead to
bnxt_init_dflt_ring_mode() calling bnxt_set_dflt_rings() and bp->num_tc
may be greater than 1.  This will cause bp->tx_ring[] to be sized too
small and cause memory corruption in bnxt_alloc_cp_rings().

Fix it by properly scaling the TX rings by bp->num_tc in the code
paths mentioned above.  Add 2 helper functions to determine
bp->tx_nr_rings and bp->tx_nr_rings_per_tc.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39810 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d00e98977ef519280b075d783653e2c492fffbb6
