Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Clear affinity hint before calling ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in error path

If a shared IRQ is used by the driver due to platform limitation, then the
IRQ affinity hint is set right after the allocation of IRQ vectors in
ath11k_pci_alloc_msi(). This does no harm unless one of the functions
requesting the IRQ fails and attempt to free the IRQ. This results in the
below warning:

WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 349 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1929 free_irq+0x278/0x29c
Call trace:
 free_irq+0x278/0x29c
 ath11k_pcic_free_irq+0x70/0x10c [ath11k]
 ath11k_pci_probe+0x800/0x820 [ath11k_pci]
 local_pci_probe+0x40/0xbc

The warning is due to not clearing the affinity hint before freeing the
IRQs.

So to fix this issue, clear the IRQ affinity hint before calling
ath11k_pcic_free_irq() in the error path. The affinity will be cleared once
again further down the error path due to code organization, but that does
no harm.

Tested-on: QCA6390 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HST.1.0.1-05266-QCAHSTSWPLZ_V2_TO_X86-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3fc42cfcc6e336f25dee79b34e57c4a63cd652a5
