Subject: CVE-2025-38196: io_uring/rsrc: validate buffer count with offset for cloning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rsrc: validate buffer count with offset for cloning

syzbot reports that it can trigger a WARN_ON() for kmalloc() attempt
that's too big:

which is due to offset + buffer_count being too large. The registration
code checks only the total count of buffers, but given that the indexing
is an array, it should also check offset + count. That can't exceed
IORING_MAX_REG_BUFFERS either, as there's no way to reach buffers beyond
that limit.

There's no issue with registrering a table this large, outside of the
fact that it's pointless to register buffers that cannot be reached, and
that it can trigger this kmalloc() warning for attempting an allocation
that is too large.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38196 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
