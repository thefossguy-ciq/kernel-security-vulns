Subject: CVE-2025-37823: net_sched: hfsc: Fix a potential UAF in hfsc_dequeue() too

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a potential UAF in hfsc_dequeue() too

Similarly to the previous patch, we need to safe guard hfsc_dequeue()
too. But for this one, we don't have a reliable reproducer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37823 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
