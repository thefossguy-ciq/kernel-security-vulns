Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Fix transport_* TOCTOU

Transport assignment may race with module unload. Protect new_transport
from becoming a stale pointer.

This also takes care of an insecure call in vsock_use_local_transport();
add a lockdep assert.

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: fffffbfff8056000
Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN
RIP: 0010:vsock_assign_transport+0x366/0x600
Call Trace:

 __x64_sys_connect+0x6e/0xc0

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38461 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
