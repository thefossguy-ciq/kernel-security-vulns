Subject: CVE-2025-40336: drm/gpusvm: fix hmm_pfn_to_map_order() usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/gpusvm: fix hmm_pfn_to_map_order() usage

Handle the case where the hmm range partially covers a huge page (like
2M), otherwise we can potentially end up doing something nasty like
mapping memory which is outside the range, and maybe not even mapped by
the mm. Fix is based on the xe userptr code, which in a future patch
will directly use gpusvm, so needs alignment here.

v2:
  - Add kernel-doc (Matt B)
  - s/fls/ilog2/ (Thomas)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40336 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
