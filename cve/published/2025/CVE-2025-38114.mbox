Subject: CVE-2025-38114: e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock

Previously, e1000_down called cancel_work_sync for the e1000 reset task
(via e1000_down_and_stop), which takes RTNL.

As reported by users and syzbot, a deadlock is possible in the following
scenario:

CPU 0:
  - RTNL is held
  - e1000_close
  - e1000_down
  - cancel_work_sync (cancel / wait for e1000_reset_task())

CPU 1:
  - process_one_work
  - e1000_reset_task
  - take RTNL

To remedy this, avoid calling cancel_work_sync from e1000_down
(e1000_reset_task does nothing if the device is down anyway). Instead,
call cancel_work_sync for e1000_reset_task when the device is being
removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38114 to this issue.

	drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
