Subject: CVE-2025-38686: userfaultfd: fix a crash in UFFDIO_MOVE when PMD is a migration entry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userfaultfd: fix a crash in UFFDIO_MOVE when PMD is a migration entry

When UFFDIO_MOVE encounters a migration PMD entry, it proceeds with
obtaining a folio and accessing it even though the entry is swp_entry_t. 
Add the missing check and let split_huge_pmd() handle migration entries. 
While at it also remove unnecessary folio check.

[surenb@google.com: remove extra folio check, per David]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
