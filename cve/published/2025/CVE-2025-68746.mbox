Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling

When the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)
is excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not
running before the transfer timeout is reached.

While handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and
the message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves
the curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.

To avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this
condition when the IRQ thread is finally run.

While at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new
interrupts can be run.

A better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a
hard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ
thread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the
extra check for a valid transfer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68746 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
