Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/md-bitmap: fix wrong bitmap_limit for clustermd when write sb

In clustermd, separate write-intent-bitmaps are used for each cluster
node:

0                    4k                     8k                    12k
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| idle                | md super            | bm super [0] + bits |
| bm bits[0, contd]   | bm super[1] + bits  | bm bits[1, contd]   |
| bm super[2] + bits  | bm bits [2, contd]  | bm super[3] + bits  |
| bm bits [3, contd]  |                     |                     |

So in node 1, pg_index in __write_sb_page() could equal to
bitmap->storage.file_pages. Then bitmap_limit will be calculated to
0. md_super_write() will be called with 0 size.
That means the first 4k sb area of node 1 will never be updated
through filemap_write_page().
This bug causes hang of mdadm/clustermd_tests/01r1_Grow_resize.

Here use (pg_index % bitmap->storage.file_pages) to make calculation
of bitmap_limit correct.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22124 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc3a9788961631359527763d7e1fcf26554c7cb1
