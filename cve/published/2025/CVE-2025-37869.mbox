Subject: CVE-2025-37869: drm/xe: Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Use local fence in error path of xe_migrate_clear

The intent of the error path in xe_migrate_clear is to wait on locally
generated fence and then return. The code is waiting on m->fence which
could be the local fence but this is only stable under the job mutex
leading to a possible UAF. Fix code to wait on local fence.

(cherry picked from commit 762b7e95362170b3e13a8704f38d5e47eca4ba74)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37869 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
