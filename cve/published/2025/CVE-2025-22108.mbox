Subject: CVE-2025-22108: bnxt_en: Mask the bd_cnt field in the TX BD properly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Mask the bd_cnt field in the TX BD properly

The bd_cnt field in the TX BD specifies the total number of BDs for
the TX packet.  The bd_cnt field has 5 bits and the maximum number
supported is 32 with the value 0.

CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS can be modified and the total number of SKB
fragments can approach or exceed the maximum supported by the chip.
Add a macro to properly mask the bd_cnt field so that the value 32
will be properly masked and set to 0 in the bd_cnd field.

Without this patch, the out-of-range bd_cnt value will corrupt the
TX BD and may cause TX timeout.

The next patch will check for values exceeding 32.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
