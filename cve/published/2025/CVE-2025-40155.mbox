Subject: CVE-2025-40155: iommu/vt-d: debugfs: Fix legacy mode page table dump logic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: debugfs: Fix legacy mode page table dump logic

In legacy mode, SSPTPTR is ignored if TT is not 00b or 01b. SSPTPTR
maybe uninitialized or zero in that case and may cause oops like:

 Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
