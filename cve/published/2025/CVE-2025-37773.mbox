Subject: CVE-2025-37773: virtiofs: add filesystem context source name check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtiofs: add filesystem context source name check

In certain scenarios, for example, during fuzz testing, the source
name may be NULL, which could lead to a kernel panic. Therefore, an
extra check for the source name should be added.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
