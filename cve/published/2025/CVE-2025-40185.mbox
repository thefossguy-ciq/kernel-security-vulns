Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: ice_adapter: release xa entry on adapter allocation failure

When ice_adapter_new() fails, the reserved XArray entry created by
xa_insert() is not released. This causes subsequent insertions at
the same index to return -EBUSY, potentially leading to
NULL pointer dereferences.

Reorder the operations as suggested by Przemek Kitszel:
1. Check if adapter already exists (xa_load)
2. Reserve the XArray slot (xa_reserve)
3. Allocate the adapter (ice_adapter_new)
4. Store the adapter (xa_store)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40185 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b9269de9815fc34d93dab90bd5169bacbe78e70
