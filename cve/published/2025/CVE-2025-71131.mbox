Subject: CVE-2025-71131: crypto: seqiv - Do not use req->iv after crypto_aead_encrypt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: seqiv - Do not use req->iv after crypto_aead_encrypt

As soon as crypto_aead_encrypt is called, the underlying request
may be freed by an asynchronous completion.  Thus dereferencing
req->iv after it returns is invalid.

Instead of checking req->iv against info, create a new variable
unaligned_info and use it for that purpose instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
