Subject: CVE-2025-38134: usb: acpi: Prevent null pointer dereference in usb_acpi_add_usb4_devlink()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: acpi: Prevent null pointer dereference in usb_acpi_add_usb4_devlink()

As demonstrated by the fix for update_port_device_state,
commit 12783c0b9e2c ("usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state"),
usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL in certain scenarios,
such as during hub driver unbind or teardown race conditions,
even if the underlying usb_device structure exists.

Plus, all other places that call usb_hub_to_struct_hub() in the same file
do check for NULL return values.

If usb_hub_to_struct_hub() returns NULL, the subsequent access to
hub->ports[udev->portnum - 1] will cause a null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
