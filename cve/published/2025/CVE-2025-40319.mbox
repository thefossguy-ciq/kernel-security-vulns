Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Sync pending IRQ work before freeing ring buffer

Fix a race where irq_work can be queued in bpf_ringbuf_commit()
but the ring buffer is freed before the work executes.
In the syzbot reproducer, a BPF program attached to sched_switch
triggers bpf_ringbuf_commit(), queuing an irq_work. If the ring buffer
is freed before this work executes, the irq_work thread may accesses
freed memory.
Calling `irq_work_sync(&rb->work)` ensures that all pending irq_work
complete before freeing the buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40319 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
