Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix deadlock in ivpu_ms_cleanup()

Fix deadlock in ivpu_ms_cleanup() by preventing runtime resume after
file_priv->ms_lock is acquired.

During a failure in runtime resume, a cold boot is executed, which
calls ivpu_ms_cleanup_all(). This function calls ivpu_ms_cleanup()
that acquires file_priv->ms_lock and causes the deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37847 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
