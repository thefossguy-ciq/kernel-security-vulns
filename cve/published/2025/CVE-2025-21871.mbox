Subject: CVE-2025-21871: tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: optee: Fix supplicant wait loop

OP-TEE supplicant is a user-space daemon and it's possible for it
be hung or crashed or killed in the middle of processing an OP-TEE
RPC call. It becomes more complicated when there is incorrect shutdown
ordering of the supplicant process vs the OP-TEE client application which
can eventually lead to system hang-up waiting for the closure of the
client application.

Allow the client process waiting in kernel for supplicant response to
be killed rather than indefinitely waiting in an unkillable state. Also,
a normal uninterruptible wait should not have resulted in the hung-task
watchdog getting triggered, but the endless loop would.

This fixes issues observed during system reboot/shutdown when supplicant
got hung for some reason or gets crashed/killed which lead to client
getting hung in an unkillable state. It in turn lead to system being in
hung up state requiring hard power off/on to recover.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
