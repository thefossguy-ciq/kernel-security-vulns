Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: bcm2835-camera: Initialise dev in v4l2_dev

Commit 42a2f6664e18 ("staging: vc04_services: Move global g_state to
vchiq_state") changed mmal_init to pass dev->v4l2_dev.dev to
vchiq_mmal_init, however nothing iniitialised dev->v4l2_dev, so we got
a NULL pointer dereference.

Set dev->v4l2_dev.dev during bcm2835_mmal_probe. The device pointer
could be passed into v4l2_device_register to set it, however that also
has other effects that would need additional changes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37971 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
