Subject: CVE-2025-39728: clk: samsung: Fix UBSAN panic in samsung_clk_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: samsung: Fix UBSAN panic in samsung_clk_init()

With UBSAN_ARRAY_BOUNDS=y, I'm hitting the below panic due to
dereferencing `ctx->clk_data.hws` before setting
`ctx->clk_data.num = nr_clks`. Move that up to fix the crash.

  UBSAN: array index out of bounds: 00000000f2005512 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
  <snip>
  Call trace:
   samsung_clk_init+0x110/0x124 (P)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39728 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
