Subject: CVE-2025-68246: ksmbd: close accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: close accepted socket when per-IP limit rejects connection

When the per-IP connection limit is exceeded in ksmbd_kthread_fn(),
the code sets ret = -EAGAIN and continues the accept loop without
closing the just-accepted socket. That leaks one socket per rejected
attempt from a single IP and enables a trivial remote DoS.

Release client_sk before continuing.

This bug was found with ZeroPath.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68246 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
