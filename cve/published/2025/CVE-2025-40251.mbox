Subject: CVE-2025-40251: devlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy

The function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to "Unset parent for
all rate objects". However, it was only calling the driver-specific
`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing
the parent's refcount, without actually setting the
`devlink_rate->parent` pointer to NULL.

This leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause
refcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is
inconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,
where the parent pointer is correctly cleared.

This patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`
to NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's
documented behavior for all rate objects.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
