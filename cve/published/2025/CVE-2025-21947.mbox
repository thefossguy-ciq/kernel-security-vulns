Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix type confusion via race condition when using ipc_msg_send_request

req->handle is allocated using ksmbd_acquire_id(&ipc_ida), based on
ida_alloc. req->handle from ksmbd_ipc_login_request and
FSCTL_PIPE_TRANSCEIVE ioctl can be same and it could lead to type confusion
between messages, resulting in access to unexpected parts of memory after
an incorrect delivery. ksmbd check type of ipc response but missing add
continue to check next ipc reponse.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
