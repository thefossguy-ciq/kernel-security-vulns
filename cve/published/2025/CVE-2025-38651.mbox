Subject: CVE-2025-38651: landlock: Fix warning from KUnit tests

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

landlock: Fix warning from KUnit tests

get_id_range() expects a positive value as first argument but
get_random_u8() can return 0.  Fix this by clamping it.

Validated by running the test in a for loop for 1000 times.

Note that MAX() is wrong as it is only supposed to be used for
constants, but max() is good here.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/127183361b69dbb7ac3246ad4726f93400481249
