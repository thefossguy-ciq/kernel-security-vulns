Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds clause 45 read/write access

When using publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools' to read/write data
from/to network interface and its PHY via C45 (clause 45) mdiobus,
there is no verification of parameters passed to the ioctl and
it accepts any mdio address.
Currently there is support for 32 addresses in kernel via PHY_MAX_ADDR define,
but it is possible to pass higher value than that via ioctl.
While read/write operation should generally fail in this case,
mdiobus provides stats array, where wrong address may allow out-of-bounds
read/write.

Fix that by adding address verification before C45 read/write operation.
While this excludes this access from any statistics, it improves security of
read/write operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
