Subject: CVE-2025-40323: fbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released

Recently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x285/0x2f0
Read of size 4 at addr ff11000001b3c69c by task syz.xxx

Based on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,
only the memory of fb_info->modelist is freed, without setting the
corresponding fb_display[i]->mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads
to UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction
steps:
1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module
   to register a new device /dev/fb1;
2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);
3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);
4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving
   a wild pointer in fb_display[];
5. Trigger the bug via system calls through fb0 attempting to delete a mode
   from fb0.

Add a check in do_unregister_framebuffer(): if the mode to be freed exists
in fb_display[], set the corresponding mode pointer to NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40323 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
