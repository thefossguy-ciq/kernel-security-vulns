Subject: CVE-2025-68217: Input: pegasus-notetaker - fix potential out-of-bounds access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: pegasus-notetaker - fix potential out-of-bounds access

In the pegasus_notetaker driver, the pegasus_probe() function allocates
the URB transfer buffer using the wMaxPacketSize value from
the endpoint descriptor. An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor
to force the allocation of a very small buffer.

Subsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific
pattern (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42),
the pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the packet without checking
the allocated buffer size. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68217 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
