Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Initialize allocated memory before use

KMSAN reports: Multiple uninitialized values detected:

- KMSAN: uninit-value in ntfs_read_hdr (3)
- KMSAN: uninit-value in bcmp (3)

Memory is allocated by __getname(), which is a wrapper for
kmem_cache_alloc(). This memory is used before being properly
cleared. Change kmem_cache_alloc() to kmem_cache_zalloc() to
properly allocate and clear memory before use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68365 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/192e8ce302f14ac66259231dd10cede19858d742
