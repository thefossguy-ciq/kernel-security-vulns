Subject: CVE-2025-21935: rapidio: add check for rio_add_net() in rio_scan_alloc_net()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rapidio: add check for rio_add_net() in rio_scan_alloc_net()

The return value of rio_add_net() should be checked.  If it fails,
put_device() should be called to free the memory and give up the reference
initialized in rio_add_net().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21935 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
