Subject: CVE-2025-71122: iommufd/selftest: Check for overflow in IOMMU_TEST_OP_ADD_RESERVED

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd/selftest: Check for overflow in IOMMU_TEST_OP_ADD_RESERVED

syzkaller found it could overflow math in the test infrastructure and
cause a WARN_ON by corrupting the reserved interval tree. This only
effects test kernels with CONFIG_IOMMUFD_TEST.

Validate the user input length in the test ioctl.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71122 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
