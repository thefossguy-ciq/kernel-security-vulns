Subject: CVE-2025-68251: erofs: avoid infinite loops due to corrupted subpage compact indexes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid infinite loops due to corrupted subpage compact indexes

Robert reported an infinite loop observed by two crafted images.

The root cause is that `clusterofs` can be larger than `lclustersize`
for !NONHEAD `lclusters` in corrupted subpage compact indexes, e.g.:

  blocksize = lclustersize = 512   lcn = 6   clusterofs = 515

Move the corresponding check for full compress indexes to
`z_erofs_load_lcluster_from_disk()` to also cover subpage compact
compress indexes.

It also fixes the position of `m->type >= Z_EROFS_LCLUSTER_TYPE_MAX`
check, since it should be placed right after
`z_erofs_load_{compact,full}_lcluster()`.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68251 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
