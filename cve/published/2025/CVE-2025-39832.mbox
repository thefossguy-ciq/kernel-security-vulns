Subject: CVE-2025-39832: net/mlx5: Fix lockdep assertion on sync reset unload event

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix lockdep assertion on sync reset unload event

Fix lockdep assertion triggered during sync reset unload event. When the
sync reset flow is initiated using the devlink reload fw_activate
option, the PF already holds the devlink lock while handling unload
event. In this case, delegate sync reset unload event handling back to
the devlink callback process to avoid double-locking and resolve the
lockdep warning.

Kernel log:
WARNING: CPU: 9 PID: 1578 at devl_assert_locked+0x31/0x40

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
