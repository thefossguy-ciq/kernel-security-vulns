Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix implicit ODP hang on parent deregistration

Fix the destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr() to prevent hanging during
parent deregistration as of below [1].

Upon entering destroy_unused_implicit_child_mr(), the reference count
for the implicit MR parent is incremented using:
refcount_inc_not_zero().

A corresponding decrement must be performed if
free_implicit_child_mr_work() is not called.

The code has been updated to properly manage the reference count that
was incremented.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cb96ae783e7249e8e5a50c22952c0bb2983133df
