Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/i10nm: Skip DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory controller

When loading the i10nm_edac driver on some Intel Granite Rapids servers,
a call trace may appear as follows:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/edac/skx_common.c:453:16
  shift exponent -66 is negative
  ...
  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x1e3/0x390
  skx_get_dimm_info.cold+0x47/0xd40 [skx_edac_common]
  i10nm_get_dimm_config+0x23e/0x390 [i10nm_edac]
  skx_register_mci+0x159/0x220 [skx_edac_common]
  i10nm_init+0xcb0/0x1ff0 [i10nm_edac]
  ...

This occurs because some BIOS may disable a memory controller if there
aren't any memory DIMMs populated on this memory controller. The DIMMMTR
register of this disabled memory controller contains the invalid value
~0, resulting in the call trace above.

Fix this call trace by skipping DIMM enumeration on a disabled memory
controller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40157 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
