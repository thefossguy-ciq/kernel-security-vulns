Subject: CVE-2025-37755: net: libwx: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: libwx: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

page_pool_dev_alloc_pages could return NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This is similar to commit 001ba0902046
("net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error").

This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
