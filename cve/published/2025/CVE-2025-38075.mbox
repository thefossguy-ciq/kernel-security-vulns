Subject: CVE-2025-38075: scsi: target: iscsi: Fix timeout on deleted connection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix timeout on deleted connection

NOPIN response timer may expire on a deleted connection and crash with
such logs:

Did not receive response to NOPIN on CID: 0, failing connection for I_T Nexus (null),i,0x00023d000125,iqn.2017-01.com.iscsi.target,t,0x3d

BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000000
NIP  strlcpy+0x8/0xb0
LR iscsit_fill_cxn_timeout_err_stats+0x5c/0xc0 [iscsi_target_mod]
Call Trace:
 iscsit_handle_nopin_response_timeout+0xfc/0x120 [iscsi_target_mod]
 call_timer_fn+0x58/0x1f0
 run_timer_softirq+0x740/0x860
 __do_softirq+0x16c/0x420
 irq_exit+0x188/0x1c0
 timer_interrupt+0x184/0x410

That is because nopin response timer may be re-started on nopin timer
expiration.

Stop nopin timer before stopping the nopin response timer to be sure
that no one of them will be re-started.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
