Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: platform: exynos4-is: Add hardware sync wait to fimc_is_hw_change_mode()

In fimc_is_hw_change_mode(), the function changes camera modes without
waiting for hardware completion, risking corrupted data or system hangs
if subsequent operations proceed before the hardware is ready.

Add fimc_is_hw_wait_intmsr0_intmsd0() after mode configuration, ensuring
hardware state synchronization and stable interrupt handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38237 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
