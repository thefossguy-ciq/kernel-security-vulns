Subject: CVE-2025-37815: misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Resolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the
generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the
current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using
generic_handle_irq.

A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was
replaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However, this change also causes
the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the
interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped
IRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
