Subject: CVE-2025-71103: drm/msm: adreno: fix deferencing ifpc_reglist when not declared

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: adreno: fix deferencing ifpc_reglist when not declared

On plaforms with an a7xx GPU not supporting IFPC, the ifpc_reglist
if still deferenced in a7xx_patch_pwrup_reglist() which causes
a kernel crash:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000008
...

Check the validity of ifpc_reglist before deferencing the table
to setup the register values.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
