Subject: CVE-2025-21908: NFS: fix nfs_release_folio() to not deadlock via kcompactd writeback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: fix nfs_release_folio() to not deadlock via kcompactd writeback

Add PF_KCOMPACTD flag and current_is_kcompactd() helper to check for it so
nfs_release_folio() can skip calling nfs_wb_folio() from kcompactd.

Otherwise NFS can deadlock waiting for kcompactd enduced writeback which
recurses back to NFS (which triggers writeback to NFSD via NFS loopback
mount on the same host, NFSD blocks waiting for XFS's call to
__filemap_get_folio):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
