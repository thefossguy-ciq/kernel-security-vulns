Subject: CVE-2025-71120: SUNRPC: svcauth_gss: avoid NULL deref on zero length gss_token in gss_read_proxy_verf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: svcauth_gss: avoid NULL deref on zero length gss_token in gss_read_proxy_verf

A zero length gss_token results in pages == 0 and in_token->pages[0]
is NULL. The code unconditionally evaluates
page_address(in_token->pages[0]) for the initial memcpy, which can
dereference NULL even when the copy length is 0. Guard the first
memcpy so it only runs when length > 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71120 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
