Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: Block access to folio overlimit

syz reported a slab-out-of-bounds Write in fuse_dev_do_write.

When the number of bytes to be retrieved is truncated to the upper limit
by fc->max_pages and there is an offset, the oob is triggered.

Add a loop termination condition to prevent overruns.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39888 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/623719227b114d73a2cee45f1b343ced63ce09ec
