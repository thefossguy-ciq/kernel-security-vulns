Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/net: ensure vectored buffer node import is tied to notification

When support for vectored registered buffers was added, the import
itself is using 'req' rather than the notification io_kiocb, sr->notif.
For non-vectored imports, sr->notif is correctly used. This is important
as the lifetime of the two may be different. Use the correct io_kiocb
for the vectored buffer import.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68294 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14459281e027f23b70885c1cc1032a71c0efd8d7
