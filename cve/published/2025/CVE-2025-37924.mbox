Subject: CVE-2025-37924: ksmbd: fix use-after-free in kerberos authentication

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in kerberos authentication

Setting sess->user = NULL was introduced to fix the dangling pointer
created by ksmbd_free_user. However, it is possible another thread could
be operating on the session and make use of sess->user after it has been
passed to ksmbd_free_user but before sess->user is set to NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
