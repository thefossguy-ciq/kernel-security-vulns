Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: acomp - Fix CFI failure due to type punning

To avoid a crash when control flow integrity is enabled, make the
workspace ("stream") free function use a consistent type, and call it
through a function pointer that has that same type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7ec68c59461ca846aab9b7c2b39f63ac7c8a43cf
