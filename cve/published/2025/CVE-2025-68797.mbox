Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid
RamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function
unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the
end.

If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist
(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this
command is a global information query and does not target a specific
board context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68797 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
