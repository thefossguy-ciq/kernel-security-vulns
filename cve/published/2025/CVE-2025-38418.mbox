Subject: CVE-2025-38418: remoteproc: core: Release rproc->clean_table after rproc_attach() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: core: Release rproc->clean_table after rproc_attach() fails

When rproc->state = RPROC_DETACHED is attached to remote processor
through rproc_attach(), if rproc_handle_resources() returns failure,
then the clean table should be released, otherwise the following
memory leak will occur.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
