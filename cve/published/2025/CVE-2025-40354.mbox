Subject: CVE-2025-40354: drm/amd/display: increase max link count and fix link->enc NULL pointer access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: increase max link count and fix link->enc NULL pointer access

[why]
1.) dc->links[MAX_LINKS] array size smaller than actual requested.
max_connector + max_dpia + 4 virtual = 14.
increase from 12 to 14.

2.) hw_init() access null LINK_ENC for dpia non display_endpoint.

(cherry picked from commit d7f5a61e1b04ed87b008c8d327649d184dc5bb45)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
