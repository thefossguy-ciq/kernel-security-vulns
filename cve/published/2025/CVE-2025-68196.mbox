Subject: CVE-2025-68196: drm/amd/display: Cache streams targeting link when performing LT automation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Cache streams targeting link when performing LT automation

[WHY]
Last LT automation update can cause crash by referencing current_state and
calling into dc_update_planes_and_stream which may clobber current_state.

[HOW]
Cache relevant stream pointers and iterate through them instead of relying
on the current_state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68196 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
