Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: Reset t_task_cdb pointer in error case

If allocation of cmd->t_task_cdb fails, it remains NULL but is later
dereferenced in the 'err' path.

In case of error, reset NULL t_task_cdb value to point at the default
fixed-size buffer.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68782 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
