Subject: CVE-2025-39699: iommu/riscv: prevent NULL deref in iova_to_phys

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/riscv: prevent NULL deref in iova_to_phys

The riscv_iommu_pte_fetch() function returns either NULL for
unmapped/never-mapped iova, or a valid leaf pte pointer that
requires no further validation.

riscv_iommu_iova_to_phys() failed to handle NULL returns.
Prevent null pointer dereference in
riscv_iommu_iova_to_phys(), and remove the pte validation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39699 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
