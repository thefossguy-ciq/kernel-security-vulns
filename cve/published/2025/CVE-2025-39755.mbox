Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: gpib: Fix cb7210 pcmcia Oops

The  pcmcia_driver struct was still only using the old .name
initialization in the drv field. This led to a NULL pointer
deref Oops in strcmp called from pcmcia_register_driver.

Initialize the pcmcia_driver struct name field.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
