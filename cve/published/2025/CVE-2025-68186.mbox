Subject: CVE-2025-68186: ring-buffer: Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ring-buffer: Do not warn in ring_buffer_map_get_reader() when reader catches up

The function ring_buffer_map_get_reader() is a bit more strict than the
other get reader functions, and except for certain situations the
rb_get_reader_page() should not return NULL. If it does, it triggers a
warning.

This warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because
another acceptable situation was happening and it wasn't checked for.

If the reader catches up to the writer and there's still data to be read
on the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as
there's no new page to get.

In this situation, the reader page should not be updated and no warning
should trigger.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68186 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
