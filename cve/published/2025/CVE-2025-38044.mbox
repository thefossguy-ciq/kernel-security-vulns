Subject: CVE-2025-38044: media: cx231xx: set device_caps for 417

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cx231xx: set device_caps for 417

The video_device for the MPEG encoder did not set device_caps.

Add this, otherwise the video device can't be registered (you get a
WARN_ON instead).

Not seen before since currently 417 support is disabled, but I found
this while experimenting with it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
