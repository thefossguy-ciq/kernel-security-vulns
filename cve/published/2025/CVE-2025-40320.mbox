Subject: CVE-2025-40320: smb: client: fix potential cfid UAF in smb2_query_info_compound

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix potential cfid UAF in smb2_query_info_compound

When smb2_query_info_compound() retries, a previously allocated cfid may
have been freed in the first attempt.
Because cfid wasn't reset on replay, later cleanup could act on a stale
pointer, leading to a potential use-after-free.

Reinitialize cfid to NULL under the replay label.

Example trace (trimmed):

refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11224 at ../lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0x110

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
