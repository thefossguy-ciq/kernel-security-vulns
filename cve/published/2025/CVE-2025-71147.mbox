Subject: CVE-2025-71147: KEYS: trusted: Fix a memory leak in tpm2_load_cmd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: Fix a memory leak in tpm2_load_cmd

'tpm2_load_cmd' allocates a tempoary blob indirectly via 'tpm2_key_decode'
but it is not freed in the failure paths. Address this by wrapping the blob
into with a cleanup helper.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
