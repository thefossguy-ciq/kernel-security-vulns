Subject: CVE-2025-39705: drm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix a Null pointer dereference vulnerability

[Why]
A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the AMD display driver's
(DC module) cleanup function dc_destruct().
When display control context (dc->ctx) construction fails
(due to memory allocation failure), this pointer remains NULL.
During subsequent error handling when dc_destruct() is called,
there's no NULL check before dereferencing the perf_trace member
(dc->ctx->perf_trace), causing a kernel null pointer dereference crash.

[How]
Check if dc->ctx is non-NULL before dereferencing.

(Updated commit text and removed unnecessary error message)
(cherry picked from commit 9dd8e2ba268c636c240a918e0a31e6feaee19404)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39705 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
