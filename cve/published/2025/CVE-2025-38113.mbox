Subject: CVE-2025-38113: ACPI: CPPC: Fix NULL pointer dereference when nosmp is used

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: CPPC: Fix NULL pointer dereference when nosmp is used

With nosmp in cmdline, other CPUs are not brought up, leaving
their cpc_desc_ptr NULL. CPU0's iteration via for_each_possible_cpu()
dereferences these NULL pointers, causing panic.

Panic backtrace:

[    0.401123] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000b8
...
[    0.403255] [<ffffffff809a5818>] cppc_allow_fast_switch+0x6a/0xd4
...
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
