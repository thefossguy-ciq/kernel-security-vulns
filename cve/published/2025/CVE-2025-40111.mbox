Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix Use-after-free in validation

Nodes stored in the validation duplicates hashtable come from an arena
allocator that is cleared at the end of vmw_execbuf_process. All nodes
are expected to be cleared in vmw_validation_drop_ht but this node escaped
because its resource was destroyed prematurely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40111 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
