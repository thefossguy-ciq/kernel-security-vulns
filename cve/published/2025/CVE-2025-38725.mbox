Subject: CVE-2025-38725: net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus

Without setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current driver may create
at most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f.
DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy
device will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system
suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will
directly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. Then
NULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or
internal phy is necessary, add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoud
the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38725 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
