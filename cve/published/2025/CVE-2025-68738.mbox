Subject: CVE-2025-68738: wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix null pointer deref in mt7996_conf_tx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix null pointer deref in mt7996_conf_tx()

If a link does not have an assigned channel yet, mt7996_vif_link returns
NULL. We still need to store the updated queue settings in that case, and
apply them later.
Move the location of the queue params to within struct mt7996_vif_link.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68738 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
