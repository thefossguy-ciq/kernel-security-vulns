Subject: CVE-2025-68322: parisc: Avoid crash due to unaligned access in unwinder

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Avoid crash due to unaligned access in unwinder

Guenter Roeck reported this kernel crash on his emulated B160L machine:

  BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, ifconfig/2420
  lock: terminate_lock.2+0x0/0x1c, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: ifconfig/2420, .owner_cpu: 0

While creating the stack trace, the unwinder uses the stack pointer to guess
the previous frame to read the previous stack pointer from memory.  The crash
happens, because the unwinder tries to read from unaligned memory and as such
triggers the unalignment trap handler which then leads to the spinlock
recursion and finally to a deadlock.

Fix it by checking the alignment before accessing the memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68322 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
