Subject: CVE-2025-38341: eth: fbnic: avoid double free when failing to DMA-map FW msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: fbnic: avoid double free when failing to DMA-map FW msg

The semantics are that caller of fbnic_mbx_map_msg() retains
the ownership of the message on error. All existing callers
dutifully free the page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38341 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
