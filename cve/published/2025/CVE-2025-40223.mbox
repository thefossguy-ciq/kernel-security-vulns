Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

most: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect

hdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually
unregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).
If that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()
immediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.

The old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in
hdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.
Depending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or
double-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also
performed puts).

Fix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),
so they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by
dropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are
redundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().

This addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in
hdm_disconnect(). See report and stack traces in the bug link below.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40223 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
