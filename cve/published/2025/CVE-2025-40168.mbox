Subject: CVE-2025-40168: smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in smc_clc_prfx_match().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu() in smc_clc_prfx_match().

smc_clc_prfx_match() is called from smc_listen_work() and
not under RCU nor RTNL.

Using sk_dst_get(sk)->dev could trigger UAF.

Let's use __sk_dst_get() and dst_dev_rcu().

Note that the returned value of smc_clc_prfx_match() is not
used in the caller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40168 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
