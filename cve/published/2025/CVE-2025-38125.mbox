Subject: CVE-2025-38125: net: stmmac: make sure that ptp_rate is not 0 before configuring EST

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: make sure that ptp_rate is not 0 before configuring EST

If the ptp_rate recorded earlier in the driver happens to be 0, this
bogus value will propagate up to EST configuration, where it will
trigger a division by 0.

Prevent this division by 0 by adding the corresponding check and error
code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38125 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
