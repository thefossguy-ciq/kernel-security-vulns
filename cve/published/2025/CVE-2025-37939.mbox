Subject: CVE-2025-37939: libbpf: Fix accessing BTF.ext core_relo header

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libbpf: Fix accessing BTF.ext core_relo header

Update btf_ext_parse_info() to ensure the core_relo header is present
before reading its fields. This avoids a potential buffer read overflow
reported by the OSS Fuzz project.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37939 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
