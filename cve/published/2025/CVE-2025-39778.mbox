Subject: CVE-2025-39778: objtool, nvmet: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in nvmet_ctrl_state_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool, nvmet: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in nvmet_ctrl_state_show()

The csts_state_names[] array only has six sparse entries, but the
iteration code in nvmet_ctrl_state_show() iterates seven, resulting in a
potential out-of-bounds stack read.  Fix that.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: .text.nvmet_ctrl_state_show: unexpected end of section

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39778 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
