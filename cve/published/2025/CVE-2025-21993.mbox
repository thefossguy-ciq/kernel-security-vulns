Subject: CVE-2025-21993: iscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()

When performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the
/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix
length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not
apply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21993 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
