Subject: CVE-2025-39859: ptp: ocp: fix use-after-free bugs causing by ptp_ocp_watchdog

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: ocp: fix use-after-free bugs causing by ptp_ocp_watchdog

The ptp_ocp_detach() only shuts down the watchdog timer if it is
pending. However, if the timer handler is already running, the
timer_delete_sync() is not called. This leads to race conditions
where the devlink that contains the ptp_ocp is deallocated while
the timer handler is still accessing it, resulting in use-after-free
bugs. The following details one of the race scenarios.

(thread 1)                           | (thread 2)
ptp_ocp_remove()                     |
  ptp_ocp_detach()                   | ptp_ocp_watchdog()
    if (timer_pending(&bp->watchdog))|   bp = timer_container_of()
      timer_delete_sync()            |
                                     |
  devlink_free(devlink) //free       |
                                     |   bp-> //use

Resolve this by unconditionally calling timer_delete_sync() to ensure
the timer is reliably deactivated, preventing any access after free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f10d3c7267ac7387a5129d5506c3c5f2460cfd9b
