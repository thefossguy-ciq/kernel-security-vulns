Subject: CVE-2025-21870: ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers

Other, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as
the ALH copier and in that case the copier->data is NULL, no alh_data is
attached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.
We could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()
and avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()
will miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.

The correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the
1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w->private is valid
2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21870 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
