Subject: CVE-2025-38731: drm/xe: Fix vm_bind_ioctl double free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix vm_bind_ioctl double free bug

If the argument check during an array bind fails, the bind_ops are freed
twice as seen below. Fix this by setting bind_ops to NULL after freeing.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77a946bf1af0e8110ef6e243394217a17f9b7e33
