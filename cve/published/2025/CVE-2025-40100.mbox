Subject: CVE-2025-40100: btrfs: do not assert we found block group item when creating free space tree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not assert we found block group item when creating free space tree

Currently, when building a free space tree at populate_free_space_tree(),
if we are not using the block group tree feature, we always expect to find
block group items (either extent items or a block group item with key type
BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY) when we search the extent tree with
btrfs_search_slot_for_read(), so we assert that we found an item. However
this expectation is wrong since we can have a new block group created in
the current transaction which is still empty and for which we still have
not added the block group's item to the extent tree, in which case we do
not have any items in the extent tree associated to the block group.

The insertion of a new block group's block group item in the extent tree
happens at btrfs_create_pending_block_groups() when it calls the helper
insert_block_group_item(). This typically is done when a transaction
handle is released, committed or when running delayed refs (either as
part of a transaction commit or when serving tickets for space reservation
if we are low on free space).

So remove the assertion at populate_free_space_tree() even when the block
group tree feature is not enabled and update the comment to mention this
case.

Syzbot reported this with the following stack trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
