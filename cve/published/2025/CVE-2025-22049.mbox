Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Increase ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN up to 16

ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is 1 by default, but some LoongArch-specific devices
(such as APBDMA) require 16 bytes alignment. When the data buffer length
is too small, the hardware may make an error writing cacheline. Thus, it
is dangerous to allocate a small memory buffer for DMA. It's always safe
to define ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN as L1_CACHE_BYTES but unnecessary (kmalloc()
need small memory objects). Therefore, just increase it to 16.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
