Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()

Syzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between
vsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.

The issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b ("vsock: Fix
transport_* TOCTOU") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in
vsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can
call vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock
held. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and
re-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold
vsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular
dependency is created.

Fix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling
transport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe
because we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the
old transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by
obtaining a module reference first via try_module_get().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40231 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
