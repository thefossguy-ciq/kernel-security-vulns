Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix NULL access in assign channel context handler

Currently, when ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev() fails, the radio handle
(ar) gets accessed from the link VIF handle (arvif) for debug logging, This
is incorrect. In the fail scenario, radio handle is NULL. Fix the NULL
access, avoid radio handle access by moving to the hardware debug logging
helper function (ath12k_hw_warn).

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1
Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38294 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f919f76893069ec3c7475acaeb611eb31fca22d
