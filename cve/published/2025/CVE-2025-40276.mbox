Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Flush shmem writes before mapping buffers CPU-uncached

The shmem layer zeroes out the new pages using cached mappings, and if
we don't CPU-flush we might leave dirty cachelines behind, leading to
potential data leaks and/or asynchronous buffer corruption when dirty
cachelines are evicted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a12f9c96d06b145562f76ffb20369b4692f0911
