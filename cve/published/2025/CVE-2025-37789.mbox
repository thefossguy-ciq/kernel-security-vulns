Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: fix nested key length validation in the set() action

It's not safe to access nla_len(ovs_key) if the data is smaller than
the netlink header.  Check that the attribute is OK first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37789 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
