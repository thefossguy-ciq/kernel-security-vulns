Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: kcm: Fix race condition in kcm_unattach()

syzbot found a race condition when kcm_unattach(psock)
and kcm_release(kcm) are executed at the same time.

kcm_unattach() is missing a check of the flag
kcm->tx_stopped before calling queue_work().

If the kcm has a reserved psock, kcm_unattach() might get executed
between cancel_work_sync() and unreserve_psock() in kcm_release(),
requeuing kcm->tx_work right before kcm gets freed in kcm_done().

Remove kcm->tx_stopped and replace it by the less
error-prone disable_work_sync().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38717 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
