Subject: CVE-2025-38509: wifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: reject VHT opmode for unsupported channel widths

VHT operating mode notifications are not defined for channel widths
below 20 MHz. In particular, 5 MHz and 10 MHz are not valid under the
VHT specification and must be rejected.

Without this check, malformed notifications using these widths may
reach ieee80211_chan_width_to_rx_bw(), leading to a WARN_ON due to
invalid input. This issue was reported by syzbot.

Reject these unsupported widths early in sta_link_apply_parameters()
when opmode_notif is used. The accepted set includes 20, 40, 80, 160,
and 80+80 MHz, which are valid for VHT. While 320 MHz is not defined
for VHT, it is allowed to avoid rejecting HE or EHT clients that may
still send a VHT opmode notification.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38509 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18eca59a04500b68a90e0c5c873f97c9d1ea2bfa
