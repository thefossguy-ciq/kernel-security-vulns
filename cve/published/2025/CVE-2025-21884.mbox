Subject: CVE-2025-21884: net: better track kernel sockets lifetime

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: better track kernel sockets lifetime

While kernel sockets are dismantled during pernet_operations->exit(),
their freeing can be delayed by any tx packets still held in qdisc
or device queues, due to skb_set_owner_w() prior calls.

This then trigger the following warning from ref_tracker_dir_exit() [1]

To fix this, make sure that kernel sockets own a reference on net->passive.

Add sk_net_refcnt_upgrade() helper, used whenever a kernel socket
is converted to a refcounted one.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
