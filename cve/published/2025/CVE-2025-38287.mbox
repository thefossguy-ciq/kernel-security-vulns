Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/cm: Drop lockdep assert and WARN when freeing old msg

The send completion handler can run after cm_id has advanced to another
message.  The cm_id lock is not needed in this case, but a recent change
re-used cm_free_priv_msg(), which asserts that the lock is held and
WARNs if the cm_id's currently outstanding msg is different than the one
being freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38287 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc096a0cd2017cb0aa1e7fb83131410af9283910
