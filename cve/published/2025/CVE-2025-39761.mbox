Subject: CVE-2025-39761: wifi: ath12k: Decrement TID on RX peer frag setup error handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Decrement TID on RX peer frag setup error handling

Currently, TID is not decremented before peer cleanup, during error
handling path of ath12k_dp_rx_peer_frag_setup(). This could lead to
out-of-bounds access in peer->rx_tid[].

Hence, add a decrement operation for TID, before peer cleanup to
ensures proper cleanup and prevents out-of-bounds access issues when
the RX peer frag setup fails.

Found during code review. Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39761 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
