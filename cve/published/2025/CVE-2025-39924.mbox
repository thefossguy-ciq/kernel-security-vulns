Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix invalid algorithm for encoded extents

The current algorithm sanity checks do not properly apply to new
encoded extents.

Unify the algorithm check with Z_EROFS_COMPRESSION(_RUNTIME)_MAX
and ensure consistency with sbi->available_compr_algs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39924 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/erofs/zmap.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db5d7abd379a8dcf030be8f52f99cadf7e397ba8
