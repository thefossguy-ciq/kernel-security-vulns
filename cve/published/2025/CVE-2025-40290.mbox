Subject: CVE-2025-40290: xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: avoid data corruption on cq descriptor number

Since commit 30f241fcf52a ("xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor
production"), the descriptor number is stored in skb control block and
xsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto
pool's completion queue.

skb control block shouldn't be used for this purpose as after transmit
xsk doesn't have control over it and other subsystems could use it. This
leads to the following kernel panic due to a NULL pointer dereference.

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

 Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
 Kernel Offset: 0x1c000000 from 0xffffffff81000000 (relocation range: 0xffffffff80000000-0xffffffffbfffffff)

Instead use the skb destructor_arg pointer along with pointer tagging.
As pointers are always aligned to 8B, use the bottom bit to indicate
whether this a single address or an allocated struct containing several
addresses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40290 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c5ea2e50b5c9aa80c5b53526257540f0c26cd66d
