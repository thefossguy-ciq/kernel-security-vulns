Subject: CVE-2025-37899: ksmbd: fix use-after-free in session logoff

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in session logoff

The sess->user object can currently be in use by another thread, for
example if another connection has sent a session setup request to
bind to the session being free'd. The handler for that connection could
be in the smb2_sess_setup function which makes use of sess->user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37899 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
