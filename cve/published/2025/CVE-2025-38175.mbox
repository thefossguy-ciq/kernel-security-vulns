Subject: CVE-2025-38175: binder: fix yet another UAF in binder_devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix yet another UAF in binder_devices

Commit e77aff5528a18 ("binderfs: fix use-after-free in binder_devices")
addressed a use-after-free where devices could be released without first
being removed from the binder_devices list. However, there is a similar
path in binder_free_proc() that was missed:

  ==================================================================

Call binder_remove_device() within binder_free_proc() to ensure the
device is removed from the binder_devices list before being kfreed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
