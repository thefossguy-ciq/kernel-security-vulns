Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Skip scalar adjustment for BPF_NEG if dst is a pointer

In check_alu_op(), the verifier currently calls check_reg_arg() and
adjust_scalar_min_max_vals() unconditionally for BPF_NEG operations.
However, if the destination register holds a pointer, these scalar
adjustments are unnecessary and potentially incorrect.

This patch adds a check to skip the adjustment logic when the destination
register contains a pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9ef4963227246b9222e1559ddeec8e7af63e6c6
