Subject: CVE-2025-38628: vdpa/mlx5: Fix release of uninitialized resources on error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa/mlx5: Fix release of uninitialized resources on error path

The commit in the fixes tag made sure that mlx5_vdpa_free()
is the single entrypoint for removing the vdpa device resources
added in mlx5_vdpa_dev_add(), even in the cleanup path of
mlx5_vdpa_dev_add().

This means that all functions from mlx5_vdpa_free() should be able to
handle uninitialized resources. This was not the case though:
mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() and mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
were not able to do so. This caused the splat below when adding
a vdpa device without a MAC address.

This patch fixes these remaining issues:

- Makes mlx5_vdpa_destroy_mr_resources() return early if called on
  uninitialized resources.

- Moves mlx5_cmd_init_async_ctx() early on during device addition
  because it can't fail. This means that mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx()
  also can't fail. To mirror this, move the call site of
  mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx() in mlx5_vdpa_free().

An additional comment was added in mlx5_vdpa_free() to document
the expectations of functions called from this context.

Splat:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
