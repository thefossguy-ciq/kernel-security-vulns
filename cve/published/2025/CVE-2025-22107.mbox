Subject: CVE-2025-22107: net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

There are actually 2 problems:
- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
  element is out of bounds.

The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
element is part of an unmapped page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22107 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/59b97641de03c081f26b3a8876628c765b5faa25
