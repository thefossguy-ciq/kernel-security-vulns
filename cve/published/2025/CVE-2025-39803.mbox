Subject: CVE-2025-39803: scsi: ufs: core: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE() call from ufshcd_uic_cmd_compl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE() call from ufshcd_uic_cmd_compl()

The UIC completion interrupt may be disabled while an UIC command is
being processed. When the UIC completion interrupt is reenabled, an UIC
interrupt is triggered and the WARN_ON_ONCE(!cmd) statement is hit.
Hence this patch that removes this kernel warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39803 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
