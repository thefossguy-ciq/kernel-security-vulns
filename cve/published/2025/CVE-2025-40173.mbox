Subject: CVE-2025-40173: net/ip6_tunnel: Prevent perpetual tunnel growth

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/ip6_tunnel: Prevent perpetual tunnel growth

Similarly to ipv4 tunnel, ipv6 version updates dev->needed_headroom, too.
While ipv4 tunnel headroom adjustment growth was limited in
commit 5ae1e9922bbd ("net: ip_tunnel: prevent perpetual headroom growth"),
ipv6 tunnel yet increases the headroom without any ceiling.

Reflect ipv4 tunnel headroom adjustment limit on ipv6 version.

Credits to Francesco Ruggeri, who was originally debugging this issue
and wrote local Arista-specific patch and a reproducer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40173 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
