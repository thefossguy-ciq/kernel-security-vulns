Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gt: Use spin_lock_irqsave() in interruptible context

spin_lock/unlock() functions used in interrupt contexts could
result in a deadlock, as seen in GitLab issue #13399,
which occurs when interrupt comes in while holding a lock.

Try to remedy the problem by saving irq state before spin lock
acquisition.

v2: add irqs' state save/restore calls to all locks/unlocks in
 signal_irq_work() execution (Maciej)

v3: use with spin_lock_irqsave() in guc_lrc_desc_unpin() instead
 of other lock/unlock calls and add Fixes and Cc tags (Tvrtko);
 change title and commit message

(cherry picked from commit c088387ddd6482b40f21ccf23db1125e8fa4af7e)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2bf1f4c129db7a10920655b000f0292f1ee509c2
