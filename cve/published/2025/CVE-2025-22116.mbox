Subject: CVE-2025-22116: idpf: check error for register_netdev() on init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: check error for register_netdev() on init

Current init logic ignores the error code from register_netdev(),
which will cause WARN_ON() on attempt to unregister it, if there was one,
and there is no info for the user that the creation of the netdev failed.

Introduce an error check and log the vport number and error code.
On removal make sure to check VPORT_REG_NETDEV flag prior to calling
unregister and free on the netdev.

Add local variables for idx, vport_config and netdev for readability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22116 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89768e33752211b2240ec4c34138170c95f11f97
