Subject: CVE-2025-38233: powerpc64/ftrace: fix clobbered r15 during livepatching

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc64/ftrace: fix clobbered r15 during livepatching

While r15 is clobbered always with PPC_FTRACE_OUT_OF_LINE, it is
not restored in livepatch sequence leading to not so obvious fails
like below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9212bf5ca640232254b31330e86272fe4073bc9
