Subject: CVE-2025-37879: 9p/net: fix improper handling of bogus negative read/write replies

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p/net: fix improper handling of bogus negative read/write replies

In p9_client_write() and p9_client_read_once(), if the server
incorrectly replies with success but a negative write/read count then we
would consider written (negative) <= rsize (positive) because both
variables were signed.

Make variables unsigned to avoid this problem.

The reproducer linked below now fails with the following error instead
of a null pointer deref:
9pnet: bogus RWRITE count (4294967295 > 3)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
