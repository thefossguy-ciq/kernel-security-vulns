Subject: CVE-2025-38654: pinctrl: canaan: k230: Fix order of DT parse and pinctrl register

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: canaan: k230: Fix order of DT parse and pinctrl register

Move DT parse before pinctrl register. This ensures that device tree
parsing is done before calling devm_pinctrl_register() to prevent using
uninitialized pin resources.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38654 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
