Subject: CVE-2025-38718: sctp: linearize cloned gso packets in sctp_rcv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: linearize cloned gso packets in sctp_rcv

A cloned head skb still shares these frag skbs in fraglist with the
original head skb. It's not safe to access these frag skbs.

syzbot reported two use-of-uninitialized-memory bugs caused by this:

This patch fixes it by linearizing cloned gso packets in sctp_rcv().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38718 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
