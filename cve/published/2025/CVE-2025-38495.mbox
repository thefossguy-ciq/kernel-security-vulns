Subject: CVE-2025-38495: HID: core: ensure the allocated report buffer can contain the reserved report ID

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: core: ensure the allocated report buffer can contain the reserved report ID

When the report ID is not used, the low level transport drivers expect
the first byte to be 0. However, currently the allocated buffer not
account for that extra byte, meaning that instead of having 8 guaranteed
bytes for implement to be working, we only have 7.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38495 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
