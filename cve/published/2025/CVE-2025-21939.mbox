Subject: CVE-2025-21939: drm/xe/hmm: Don't dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/hmm: Don't dereference struct page pointers without notifier lock

The pnfs that we obtain from hmm_range_fault() point to pages that
we don't have a reference on, and the guarantee that they are still
in the cpu page-tables is that the notifier lock must be held and the
notifier seqno is still valid.

So while building the sg table and marking the pages accesses / dirty
we need to hold this lock with a validated seqno.

However, the lock is reclaim tainted which makes
sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() unusable, since it internally
allocates memory.

Instead build the sg-table manually. For the non-iommu case
this might lead to fewer coalesces, but if that's a problem it can
be fixed up later in the resource cursor code. For the iommu case,
the whole sg-table may still be coalesced to a single contigous
device va region.

This avoids marking pages that we don't own dirty and accessed, and
it also avoid dereferencing struct pages that we don't own.

v2:
- Use assert to check whether hmm pfns are valid (Matthew Auld)
- Take into account that large pages may cross range boundaries
  (Matthew Auld)

v3:
- Don't unnecessarily check for a non-freed sg-table. (Matthew Auld)
- Add a missing up_read() in an error path. (Matthew Auld)

(cherry picked from commit ea3e66d280ce2576664a862693d1da8fd324c317)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21939 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a24c98f0e4cc994334598d4f3a851972064809d
