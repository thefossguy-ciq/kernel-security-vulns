Subject: CVE-2025-39877: mm/damon/sysfs: fix use-after-free in state_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs: fix use-after-free in state_show()

state_show() reads kdamond->damon_ctx without holding damon_sysfs_lock. 
This allows a use-after-free race:

CPU 0                         CPU 1
-----                         -----
state_show()                  damon_sysfs_turn_damon_on()
ctx = kdamond->damon_ctx;     mutex_lock(&damon_sysfs_lock);
                              damon_destroy_ctx(kdamond->damon_ctx);
                              kdamond->damon_ctx = NULL;
                              mutex_unlock(&damon_sysfs_lock);
damon_is_running(ctx);        /* ctx is freed */
mutex_lock(&ctx->kdamond_lock); /* UAF */

(The race can also occur with damon_sysfs_kdamonds_rm_dirs() and
damon_sysfs_kdamond_release(), which free or replace the context under
damon_sysfs_lock.)

Fix by taking damon_sysfs_lock before dereferencing the context, mirroring
the locking used in pid_show().

The bug has existed since state_show() first accessed kdamond->damon_ctx.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39877 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
