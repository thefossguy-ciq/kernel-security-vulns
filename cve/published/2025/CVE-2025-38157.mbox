Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled

A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an
ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes
a device-by-zero error in the driver, leading to either a crash or an
out of bounds read.

Prevent this by aborting the handling in ath9k_htc_swba() if beacons are
not enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38157 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
