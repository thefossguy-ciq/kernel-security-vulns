Subject: CVE-2025-40225: drm/panthor: Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region

This commit address a kernel panic issue that can happen if Userspace
tries to partially unmap a GPU virtual region (aka drm_gpuva).
The VM_BIND interface allows partial unmapping of a BO.

Panthor driver pre-allocates memory for the new drm_gpuva structures
that would be needed for the map/unmap operation, done using drm_gpuvm
layer. It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap
but a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it
ended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.

Following dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.
 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000078

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
