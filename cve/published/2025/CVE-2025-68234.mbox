Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/cmd_net: fix wrong argument types for skb_queue_splice()

If timestamp retriving needs to be retried and the local list of
SKB's already has entries, then it's spliced back into the socket
queue. However, the arguments for the splice helper are transposed,
causing exactly the wrong direction of splicing into the on-stack
list. Fix that up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c85d2cfc5e24e6866b56c7253fd4e1c7db35986c
