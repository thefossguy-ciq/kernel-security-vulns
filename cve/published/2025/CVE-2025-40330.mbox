Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Shutdown FW DMA in bnxt_shutdown()

The netif_close() call in bnxt_shutdown() only stops packet DMA.  There
may be FW DMA for trace logging (recently added) that will continue.  If
we kexec to a new kernel, the DMA will corrupt memory in the new kernel.

Add bnxt_hwrm_func_drv_unrgtr() to unregister the driver from the FW.
This will stop the FW DMA.  In case the call fails, call pcie_flr() to
reset the function and stop the DMA.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40330 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a8a15c3f71d1199d510ccba4bc201cbd2204048
