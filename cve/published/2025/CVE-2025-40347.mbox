Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock

After applying the workaround for err050089, the LS1028A platform
experiences RCU stalls on RT kernel. This issue is caused by the
recursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some
of the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to
a deadlock:

enetc_poll
  -> enetc_lock_mdio
  -> enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done
     -> napi_gro_receive
        -> enetc_start_xmit
           -> enetc_lock_mdio
           -> enetc_map_tx_buffs
           -> enetc_unlock_mdio
  -> enetc_unlock_mdio

After enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts
to acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a
read lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under
enetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already
waiting, leading to a thread hang.

Currently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent
recursive lock acquisition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40347 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
