Subject: CVE-2025-68193: drm/xe/guc: Add devm release action to safely tear down CT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc: Add devm release action to safely tear down CT

When a buffer object (BO) is allocated with the XE_BO_FLAG_GGTT_INVALIDATE
flag, the driver initiates TLB invalidation requests via the CTB mechanism
while releasing the BO. However a premature release of the CTB BO can lead
to system crashes, as observed in:

Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI
RIP: 0010:h2g_write+0x2f3/0x7c0 [xe]
Call Trace:
 guc_ct_send_locked+0x8b/0x670 [xe]
 xe_guc_ct_send_locked+0x19/0x60 [xe]
 send_tlb_invalidation+0xb4/0x460 [xe]

 xe_ggtt_node_remove+0x40/0xa0 [xe]
 xe_ggtt_remove_bo+0x87/0x250 [xe]

Introduce a devm-managed release action during xe_guc_ct_init() and
xe_guc_ct_init_post_hwconfig() to ensure proper CTB disablement before
resource deallocation, preventing the use-after-free scenario.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68193 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
