Subject: CVE-2025-37938: tracing: Verify event formats that have "%*p.."

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Verify event formats that have "%*p.."

The trace event verifier checks the formats of trace events to make sure
that they do not point at memory that is not in the trace event itself or
in data that will never be freed. If an event references data that was
allocated when the event triggered and that same data is freed before the
event is read, then the kernel can crash by reading freed memory.

The verifier runs at boot up (or module load) and scans the print formats
of the events and checks their arguments to make sure that dereferenced
pointers are safe. If the format uses "%*p.." the verifier will ignore it,
and that could be dangerous. Cover this case as well.

Also add to the sample code a use case of "%*pbl".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
