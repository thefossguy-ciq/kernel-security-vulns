In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Fix "KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in ib_register_device" problem

This problem is similar to the problem that the
commit 1d6a9e7449e2 ("RDMA/core: Fix use-after-free when rename device name")
fixes.

The root cause is: the function ib_device_rename() renames the name with
lock. But in the function kobject_uevent(), this name is accessed without
lock protection at the same time.

The solution is to add the lock protection when this name is accessed in
the function kobject_uevent().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38022 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
