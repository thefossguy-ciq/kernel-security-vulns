Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: avs: Verify content returned by parse_int_array()

The first element of the returned array stores its length. If it is 0,
any manipulation beyond the element at index 0 ends with null-ptr-deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
