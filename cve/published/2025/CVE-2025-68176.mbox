Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: cadence: Check for the existence of cdns_pcie::ops before using it

cdns_pcie::ops might not be populated by all the Cadence glue drivers. This
is going to be true for the upcoming Sophgo platform which doesn't set the
ops.

Hence, add a check to prevent NULL pointer dereference.

[mani: reworded subject and description]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
