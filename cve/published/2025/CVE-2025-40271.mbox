Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc: fix uaf in proc_readdir_de()

Pde is erased from subdir rbtree through rb_erase(), but not set the node
to EMPTY, which may result in uaf access.  We should use RB_CLEAR_NODE()
set the erased node to EMPTY, then pde_subdir_next() will return NULL to
avoid uaf access.

We found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase
getdent and tun in the same time.  The steps of the issue is as follows:

1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current
   pde is tun3;

2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase
   them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the
   pde(tun2) will be released to slab;

3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return
   pde(tun2) which is released, it will case uaf access.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
