Subject: CVE-2025-40083: net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue

To prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)
when cl->qdisc->ops->peek(cl->qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return
value before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.

To avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:

1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static
inline function.

2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to
include/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.

3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid crashing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
