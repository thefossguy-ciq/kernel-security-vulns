Subject: CVE-2025-38481: comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

The handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to
hold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the
`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.
The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too
large.

Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`
value is unreasonable.

Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set
this to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximum
allowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct
comedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at
least 1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38481 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
