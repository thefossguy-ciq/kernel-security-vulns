Subject: CVE-2025-38137: PCI/pwrctrl: Cancel outstanding rescan work when unregistering

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/pwrctrl: Cancel outstanding rescan work when unregistering

It's possible to trigger use-after-free here by:

  (a) forcing rescan_work_func() to take a long time and
  (b) utilizing a pwrctrl driver that may be unloaded for some reason

Cancel outstanding work to ensure it is finished before we allow our data
structures to be cleaned up.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
