Subject: CVE-2025-71119: powerpc/kexec: Enable SMT before waking offline CPUs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/kexec: Enable SMT before waking offline CPUs

If SMT is disabled or a partial SMT state is enabled, when a new kernel
image is loaded for kexec, on reboot the following warning is observed:

kexec: Waking offline cpu 228.
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9062 at arch/powerpc/kexec/core_64.c:223 kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1b0/0x1bc
[snip]
 NIP kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1b0/0x1bc
 LR  kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1a0/0x1bc
 Call Trace:
  kexec_prepare_cpus+0x1a0/0x1bc (unreliable)
  default_machine_kexec+0x160/0x19c

  __do_sys_reboot+0x210/0x2c4
  system_call_exception+0x124/0x320
  system_call_vectored_common+0x15c/0x2ec

This occurs as add_cpu() fails due to cpu_bootable() returning false for
CPUs that fail the cpu_smt_thread_allowed() check or non primary
threads if SMT is disabled.

Fix the issue by enabling SMT and resetting the number of SMT threads to
the number of threads per core, before attempting to wake up all present
CPUs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71119 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
