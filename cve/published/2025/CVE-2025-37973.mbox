Subject: CVE-2025-37973: wifi: cfg80211: fix out-of-bounds access during multi-link element defragmentation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: fix out-of-bounds access during multi-link element defragmentation

Currently during the multi-link element defragmentation process, the
multi-link element length added to the total IEs length when calculating
the length of remaining IEs after the multi-link element in
cfg80211_defrag_mle(). This could lead to out-of-bounds access if the
multi-link element or its corresponding fragment elements are the last
elements in the IEs buffer.

To address this issue, correctly calculate the remaining IEs length by
deducting the multi-link element end offset from total IEs end offset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
