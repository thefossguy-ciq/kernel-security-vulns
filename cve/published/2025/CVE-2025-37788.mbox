Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path

In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a
memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,
but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow
goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from
(i-1)th iteration are freed.

Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37788 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
