Subject: CVE-2025-22025: nfsd: put dl_stid if fail to queue dl_recall

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: put dl_stid if fail to queue dl_recall

Before calling nfsd4_run_cb to queue dl_recall to the callback_wq, we
increment the reference count of dl_stid.
We expect that after the corresponding work_struct is processed, the
reference count of dl_stid will be decremented through the callback
function nfsd4_cb_recall_release.
However, if the call to nfsd4_run_cb fails, the incremented reference
count of dl_stid will not be decremented correspondingly, leading to the
following nfs4_stid leak:

Fix it by checking the result of nfsd4_run_cb and call nfs4_put_stid if
fail to queue dl_recall.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
