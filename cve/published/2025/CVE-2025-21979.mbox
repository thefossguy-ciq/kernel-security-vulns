Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy

A wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and
initialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the
rdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.

If wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,
the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run
it'll use invalid memory.

Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
