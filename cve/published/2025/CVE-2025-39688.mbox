Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()

The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a
delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the
deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets
bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.

When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with
SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked
with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for
s FREE_STATEID call.

nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status
flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask
never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations
are (almost) never found.

Add SC_STATUS_FREEABLE to the always-allowed status flags, and remove it
from nfsd4_delegreturn() since it's now always implied.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39688 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
