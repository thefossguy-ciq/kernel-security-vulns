Subject: CVE-2025-68315: f2fs: fix to detect potential corrupted nid in free_nid_list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to detect potential corrupted nid in free_nid_list

As reported, on-disk footer.ino and footer.nid is the same and
out-of-range, let's add sanity check on f2fs_alloc_nid() to detect
any potential corruption in free_nid_list.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
