Subject: CVE-2025-39774: iio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Set driver data before enabling runtime PM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: rzg2l_adc: Set driver data before enabling runtime PM

When stress-testing the system by repeatedly unbinding and binding the ADC
device in a loop, and the ADC is a supplier for another device (e.g., a
thermal hardware block that reads temperature through the ADC), it may
happen that the ADC device is runtime-resumed immediately after runtime PM
is enabled, triggered by its consumer. At this point, since drvdata is not
yet set and the driver's runtime PM callbacks rely on it, a crash can
occur. To avoid this, set drvdata just after it was allocated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
