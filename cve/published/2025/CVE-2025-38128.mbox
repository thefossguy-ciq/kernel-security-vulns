Subject: CVE-2025-38128: Bluetooth: MGMT: reject malformed HCI_CMD_SYNC commands

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: MGMT: reject malformed HCI_CMD_SYNC commands

In 'mgmt_hci_cmd_sync()', check whether the size of parameters passed
in 'struct mgmt_cp_hci_cmd_sync' matches the total size of the data
(i.e. 'sizeof(struct mgmt_cp_hci_cmd_sync)' plus trailing bytes).
Otherwise, large invalid 'params_len' will cause 'hci_cmd_sync_alloc()'
to do 'skb_put_data()' from an area beyond the one actually passed to
'mgmt_hci_cmd_sync()'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38128 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
