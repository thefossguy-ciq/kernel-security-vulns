Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: handle errors in mlx5_chains_create_table()

In mlx5_chains_create_table(), the return value ofÂ mlx5_get_fdb_sub_ns()
and mlx5_get_flow_namespace() must be checked to prevent NULL pointer
dereferences. If either function fails, the function should log error
message with mlx5_core_warn() and return error pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21975 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
