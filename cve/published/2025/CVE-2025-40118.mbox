Subject: CVE-2025-40118: scsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm80xx: Fix array-index-out-of-of-bounds on rmmod

Since commit f7b705c238d1 ("scsi: pm80xx: Set phy_attached to zero when
device is gone") UBSAN reports:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/scsi/pm8001/pm8001_sas.c:786:17
  index 28 is out of range for type 'pm8001_phy [16]'

on rmmod when using an expander.

For a direct attached device, attached_phy contains the local phy id.
For a device behind an expander, attached_phy contains the remote phy
id, not the local phy id.

I.e. while pm8001_ha will have pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy local phys, for a
device behind an expander, attached_phy can be much larger than
pm8001_ha->chip->n_phy (depending on the amount of phys of the
expander).

E.g. on my system pm8001_ha has 8 phys with phy ids 0-7.  One of the
ports has an expander connected.  The expander has 31 phys with phy ids
0-30.

The pm8001_ha->phy array only contains the phys of the HBA.  It does not
contain the phys of the expander.  Thus, it is wrong to use attached_phy
to index the pm8001_ha->phy array for a device behind an expander.

Thus, we can only clear phy_attached for devices that are directly
attached.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40118 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
