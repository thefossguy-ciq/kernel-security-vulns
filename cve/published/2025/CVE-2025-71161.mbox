Subject: CVE-2025-71161: dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction

There are two problems with the recursive correction:

1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that
has 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block
recursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that
there may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team
actually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this
image just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.

2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable
"fio->bufs", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if
"verity_hash_for_block" invoked correction recursively, it would
overwrite partially filled fio->bufs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71161 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/md/dm-verity-fec.c
	drivers/md/dm-verity-fec.h

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/232948cf600fba69aff36b25d85ef91a73a35756
