Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()

Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended
inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled
as a delayed work (aes_battery_work).

In wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently, if
the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard
crashes or "Oops: general protection fault..." are experienced when
wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with
built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
was still pending at the time of hibernation.

So, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38253 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
