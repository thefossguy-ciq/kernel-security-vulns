Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is
non-zero before calling it.

2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use
   RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38177 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
