Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: lan78xx: Fix lost EEPROM read timeout error(-ETIMEDOUT) in lan78xx_read_raw_eeprom

Syzbot reported read of uninitialized variable BUG with following call stack.

lan78xx 8-1:1.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): EEPROM read operation timeout
=====================================================
BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in lan78xx_read_eeprom drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c:1095 [inline]

 lan78xx_bind+0x711/0x1690 drivers/net/usb/lan78xx.c:3766

The function lan78xx_read_raw_eeprom failed to properly propagate EEPROM
read timeout errors (-ETIMEDOUT). In the fallthrough path, it first
attempted to restore the pin configuration for LED outputs and then
returned only the status of that restore operation, discarding the
original timeout error.

As a result, callers could mistakenly treat the data buffer as valid
even though the EEPROM read had actually timed out with no data or partial
data.

To fix this, handle errors in restoring the LED pin configuration separately.
If the restore succeeds, return any prior EEPROM timeout error correctly
to the caller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40189 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a72a7c4f675080a324d4c2167bd2314d968279f1
