Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: explicitly disallow disconnect

syzbot discovered that it can disconnect a TLS socket and then
run into all sort of unexpected corner cases. I have a vague
recollection of Eric pointing this out to us a long time ago.
Supporting disconnect is really hard, for one thing if offload
is enabled we'd need to wait for all packets to be _acked_.
Disconnect is not commonly used, disallow it.

The immediate problem syzbot run into is the warning in the strp,
but that's just the easiest bug to trigger:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5834 at net/tls/tls_strp.c:486 tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486
  RIP: 0010:tls_strp_msg_load+0x72e/0xa80 net/tls/tls_strp.c:486

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
