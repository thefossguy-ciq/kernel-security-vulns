Subject: CVE-2025-71188: dmaengine: lpc18xx-dmamux: fix device leak on route allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: lpc18xx-dmamux: fix device leak on route allocation

Make sure to drop the reference taken when looking up the DMA mux
platform device during route allocation.

Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
