Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: fsl-mc: fix double-free on mc_dev

The blamed commit tried to simplify how the deallocations are done but,
in the process, introduced a double-free on the mc_dev variable.

In case the MC device is a DPRC, a new mc_bus is allocated and the
mc_dev variable is just a reference to one of its fields. In this
circumstance, on the error path only the mc_bus should be freed.

This commit introduces back the following checkpatch warning which is a
false-positive.

WARNING: kfree(NULL) is safe and this check is probably not required
+       if (mc_bus)
+               kfree(mc_bus);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38313 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
