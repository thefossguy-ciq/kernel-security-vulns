Subject: CVE-2025-68784: xfs: fix a UAF problem in xattr repair

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: fix a UAF problem in xattr repair

The xchk_setup_xattr_buf function can allocate a new value buffer, which
means that any reference to ab->value before the call could become a
dangling pointer.  Fix this by moving an assignment to after the buffer
setup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68784 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
