Subject: CVE-2025-38272: net: dsa: b53: do not enable EEE on bcm63xx

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: b53: do not enable EEE on bcm63xx

BCM63xx internal switches do not support EEE, but provide multiple RGMII
ports where external PHYs may be connected. If one of these PHYs are EEE
capable, we may try to enable EEE for the MACs, which then hangs the
system on access of the (non-existent) EEE registers.

Fix this by checking if the switch actually supports EEE before
attempting to configure it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38272 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
