Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/cpu/hygon: Add missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in bsp_init helper

Since

  923f3a2b48bd ("x86/resctrl: Query LLC monitoring properties once during boot")

resctrl_cpu_detect() has been moved from common CPU initialization code to
the vendor-specific BSP init helper, while Hygon didn't put that call in their
code.

This triggers a division by zero fault during early booting stage on our
machines with X86_FEATURE_CQM* supported, where get_rdt_mon_resources() tries
to calculate mon_l3_config with uninitialized boot_cpu_data.x86_cache_occ_scale.

Add the missing resctrl_cpu_detect() in the Hygon BSP init helper.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39681 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
