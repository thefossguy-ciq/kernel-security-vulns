Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: transport_ipc: validate payload size before reading handle

handle_response() dereferences the payload as a 4-byte handle without
verifying that the declared payload size is at least 4 bytes. A malformed
or truncated message from ksmbd.mountd can lead to a 4-byte read past the
declared payload size. Validate the size before dereferencing.

This is a minimal fix to guard the initial handle read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
