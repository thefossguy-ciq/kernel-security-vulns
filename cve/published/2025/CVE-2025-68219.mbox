Subject: CVE-2025-68219: cifs: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param error path

Add proper cleanup of ctx->source and fc->source to the
cifs_parse_mount_err error handler. This ensures that memory allocated
for the source strings is correctly freed on all error paths, matching
the cleanup already performed in the success path by
smb3_cleanup_fs_context_contents().
Pointers are also set to NULL after freeing to prevent potential
double-free issues.

This change fixes a memory leak originally detected by syzbot. The
leak occurred when processing Opt_source mount options if an error
happened after ctx->source and fc->source were successfully
allocated but before the function completed.

The specific leak sequence was:
1. ctx->source = smb3_fs_context_fullpath(ctx, '/') allocates memory
2. fc->source = kstrdup(ctx->source, GFP_KERNEL) allocates more memory
3. A subsequent error jumps to cifs_parse_mount_err
4. The old error handler freed passwords but not the source strings,
causing the memory to leak.

This issue was not addressed by commit e8c73eb7db0a ("cifs: client:
fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param"), which only fixed
leaks from repeated fsconfig() calls but not this error path.

Patch updated with minor change suggested by kernel test robot

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68219 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
