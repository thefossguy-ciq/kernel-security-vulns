Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: don't clobber ret in btrfs_validate_super()

Commit 2a9bb78cfd36 ("btrfs: validate system chunk array at
btrfs_validate_super()") introduces a call to validate_sys_chunk_array()
in btrfs_validate_super(), which clobbers the value of ret set earlier.
This has the effect of negating the validity checks done earlier, making
it so btrfs could potentially try to mount invalid filesystems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22114 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef6800a2015e706e9852a5ec15263fec9990d012
