Subject: CVE-2025-68184: drm/mediatek: Disable AFBC support on Mediatek DRM driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Disable AFBC support on Mediatek DRM driver

Commit c410fa9b07c3 ("drm/mediatek: Add AFBC support to Mediatek DRM
driver") added AFBC support to Mediatek DRM and enabled the
32x8/split/sparse modifier.

However, this is currently broken on Mediatek MT8188 (Genio 700 EVK
platform); tested using upstream Kernel and Mesa (v25.2.1), AFBC is used by
default since Mesa v25.0.

Kernel trace reports vblank timeouts constantly, and the render is garbled:

```

Until this gets fixed upstream, disable AFBC support on this platform, as
it's currently broken with upstream Mesa.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
