Subject: CVE-2025-21909: wifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: reject cooked mode if it is set along with other flags

It is possible to set both MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES and MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVE
flags simultaneously on the same monitor interface from the userspace. This
causes a sub-interface to be created with no IEEE80211_SDATA_IN_DRIVER bit
set because the monitor interface is in the cooked state and it takes
precedence over all other states. When the interface is then being deleted
the kernel calls WARN_ONCE() from check_sdata_in_driver() because of missing
that bit.

Fix this by rejecting MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES if it is set along with
other flags.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21909 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
