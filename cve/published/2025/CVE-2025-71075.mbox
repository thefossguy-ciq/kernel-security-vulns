Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: aic94xx: fix use-after-free in device removal path

The asd_pci_remove() function fails to synchronize with pending tasklets
before freeing the asd_ha structure, leading to a potential
use-after-free vulnerability.

When a device removal is triggered (via hot-unplug or module unload),
race condition can occur.

The fix adds tasklet_kill() before freeing the asd_ha structure,
ensuring all scheduled tasklets complete before cleanup proceeds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
