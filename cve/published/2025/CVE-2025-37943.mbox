Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix invalid data access in ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi

In certain cases, hardware might provide packets with a
length greater than the maximum native Wi-Fi header length.
This can lead to accessing and modifying fields in the header
within the ath12k_dp_rx_h_undecap_nwifi function for
DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type and
potentially resulting in invalid data access and memory corruption.

Add a sanity check before processing the SKB to prevent invalid
data access in the undecap native Wi-Fi function for the
DP_RX_DECAP_TYPE_NATIVE_WIFI decap type.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
