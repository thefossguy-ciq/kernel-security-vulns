Subject: CVE-2025-22050: usbnet:fix NPE during rx_complete

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet:fix NPE during rx_complete

Missing usbnet_going_away Check in Critical Path.
The usb_submit_urb function lacks a usbnet_going_away
validation, whereas __usbnet_queue_skb includes this check.

This inconsistency creates a race condition where:
A URB request may succeed, but the corresponding SKB data
fails to be queued.

Subsequent processes:
(e.g., rx_complete → defer_bh → __skb_unlink(skb, list))
attempt to access skb->next, triggering a NULL pointer
dereference (Kernel Panic).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
