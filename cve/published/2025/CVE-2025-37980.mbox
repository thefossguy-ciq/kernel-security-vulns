Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix resource leak in blk_register_queue() error path

When registering a queue fails after blk_mq_sysfs_register() is
successful but the function later encounters an error, we need
to clean up the blk_mq_sysfs resources.

Add the missing blk_mq_sysfs_unregister() call in the error path
to properly clean up these resources and prevent a memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37980 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
