Subject: CVE-2025-68205: ALSA: hda/hdmi: Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda/hdmi: Fix breakage at probing nvhdmi-mcp driver

After restructuring and splitting the HDMI codec driver code, each
HDMI codec driver contains the own build_controls and build_pcms ops.
A copy-n-paste error put the wrong entries for nvhdmi-mcp driver; both
build_controls and build_pcms are swapped.  Unfortunately both
callbacks have the very same form, and the compiler didn't complain
it, either.  This resulted in a NULL dereference because the PCM
instance hasn't been initialized at calling the build_controls
callback.

Fix it by passing the proper entries.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68205 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2aed6fac1148528181affb781aa683d6569042b
