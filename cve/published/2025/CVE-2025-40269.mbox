Subject: CVE-2025-40269: ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer

The PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is transferred over USB URB
packet buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The
packet sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB
descriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes
are determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than
the size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported
by syzbot.

Basically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,
it implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB
descriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at
the parameter setup time before doing any further operations.

This patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when
the packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with
ep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or
greater than ep->packsize[0].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
