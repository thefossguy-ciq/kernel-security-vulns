Subject: CVE-2025-40255: net: core: prevent NULL deref in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: core: prevent NULL deref in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()

The ethtool tsconfig Netlink path can trigger a null pointer
dereference. A call chain such as:

  tsconfig_prepare_data() ->
  dev_get_hwtstamp_phylib() ->
  vlan_hwtstamp_get() ->
  generic_hwtstamp_get_lower() ->
  generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()

results in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower() being called with
kernel_cfg->ifr as NULL.

The generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower() function does not expect
a NULL ifr and dereferences it, leading to a system crash.

Fix this by adding a NULL check for kernel_cfg->ifr in
generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower(). If ifr is NULL, return -EINVAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40255 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8817f816ae41908e9625c0770c4af0dcdcc01238
