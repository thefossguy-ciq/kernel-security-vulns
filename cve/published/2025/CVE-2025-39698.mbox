Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/futex: ensure io_futex_wait() cleans up properly on failure

The io_futex_data is allocated upfront and assigned to the io_kiocb
async_data field, but the request isn't marked with REQ_F_ASYNC_DATA
at that point. Those two should always go together, as the flag tells
io_uring whether the field is valid or not.

Additionally, on failure cleanup, the futex handler frees the data but
does not clear ->async_data. Clear the data and the flag in the error
path as well.

Thanks to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and particularly ReDress for
reporting this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39698 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
