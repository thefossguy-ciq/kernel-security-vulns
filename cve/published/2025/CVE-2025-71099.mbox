Subject: CVE-2025-71099: drm/xe/oa: Fix potential UAF in xe_oa_add_config_ioctl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/oa: Fix potential UAF in xe_oa_add_config_ioctl()

In xe_oa_add_config_ioctl(), we accessed oa_config->id after dropping
metrics_lock. Since this lock protects the lifetime of oa_config, an
attacker could guess the id and call xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl() with
perfect timing, freeing oa_config before we dereference it, leading to
a potential use-after-free.

Fix this by caching the id in a local variable while holding the lock.

v2: (Matt A)
- Dropped mutex_unlock(&oa->metrics_lock) ordering change from
  xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl()

(cherry picked from commit 28aeaed130e8e587fd1b73b6d66ca41ccc5a1a31)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71099 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
