Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix error handling path in bnxt_init_chip()

WARN_ON() is triggered in __flush_work() if bnxt_init_chip() fails
because we call cancel_work_sync() on dim work that has not been
initialized.

WARNING: CPU: 37 PID: 5223 at kernel/workqueue.c:4201 __flush_work.isra.0+0x212/0x230

The driver relies on the BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED bit to check if dim
work has already been cancelled.  But in the bnxt_open() path,
BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED is not set and this causes the error
path to think that it needs to cancel the uninitalized dim work.
Fix it by setting BNXT_STATE_NAPI_DISABLED during initialization.
The bit will be cleared when we enable NAPI and initialize dim work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37895 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
