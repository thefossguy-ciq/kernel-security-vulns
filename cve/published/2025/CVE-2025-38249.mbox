Subject: CVE-2025-38249: ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from
snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38249 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
