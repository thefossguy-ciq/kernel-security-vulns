Subject: CVE-2025-37987: pds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition

The pds_core's adminq is protected by the adminq_lock, which prevents
more than 1 command to be posted onto it at any one time. This makes it
so the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.
However, the completions happen in a different context, which means
multiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting
on completion.

On the FW side, the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries
long and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is
lacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck, so commands are no
longer processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.

As an initial fix, prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so
there's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works
because the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16
pending adminq commands, so it will never overflow. This is done by
reducing the adminq depth to 16.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37987 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
