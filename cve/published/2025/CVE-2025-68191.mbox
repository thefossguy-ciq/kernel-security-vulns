Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udp_tunnel: use netdev_warn() instead of netdev_WARN()

netdev_WARN() uses WARN/WARN_ON to print a backtrace along with
file and line information. In this case, udp_tunnel_nic_register()
returning an error is just a failed operation, not a kernel bug.

udp_tunnel_nic_register() can fail due to a memory allocation
failure (kzalloc() or udp_tunnel_nic_alloc()).
This is a normal runtime error and not a kernel bug.

Replace netdev_WARN() with netdev_warn() accordingly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
