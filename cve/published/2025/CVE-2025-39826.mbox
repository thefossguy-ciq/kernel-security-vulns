Subject: CVE-2025-39826: net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: convert 'use' field to refcount_t

The 'use' field in struct rose_neigh is used as a reference counter but
lacks atomicity. This can lead to race conditions where a rose_neigh
structure is freed while still being referenced by other code paths.

For example, when rose_neigh->use becomes zero during an ioctl operation
via rose_rt_ioctl(), the structure may be removed while its timer is
still active, potentially causing use-after-free issues.

This patch changes the type of 'use' from unsigned short to refcount_t and
updates all code paths to use rose_neigh_hold() and rose_neigh_put() which
operate reference counts atomically.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39826 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
