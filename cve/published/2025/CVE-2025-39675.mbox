Subject: CVE-2025-39675: drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check in mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check in mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session()

The function mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session() calls the function
get_first_active_display(), but does not check its return value.
The return value is a null pointer if the display list is empty.
This will lead to a null pointer dereference.

Add a null pointer check for get_first_active_display() and return
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_DISPLAY_NOT_FOUND if the function return null.

This is similar to the commit c3e9826a2202
("drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check for get_first_active_display()").

(cherry picked from commit 5e43eb3cd731649c4f8b9134f857be62a416c893)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39675 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
