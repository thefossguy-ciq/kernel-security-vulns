Subject: CVE-2025-39694: s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present check

Tracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exits
if the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check is
performed after physical to virtual address translation.

If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address zero, the
resulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won't
work. Subsequently this may result in incorrect accesses to the first
page of the identity mapping.

Fix this by introducing a function that handles the NULL case before
address translation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
