Subject: CVE-2025-40053: net: dlink: handle copy_thresh allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dlink: handle copy_thresh allocation failure

The driver did not handle failure of `netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align()`.
If the allocation failed, dereferencing `skb->protocol` could lead to
a NULL pointer dereference.

This patch tries to allocate `skb`. If the allocation fails, it falls
back to the normal path.

Tested-on: D-Link DGE-550T Rev-A3

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40053 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
