Subject: CVE-2025-38642: wifi: mac80211: fix WARN_ON for monitor mode on some devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix WARN_ON for monitor mode on some devices

On devices without WANT_MONITOR_VIF (and probably without
channel context support) we get a WARN_ON for changing the
per-link setting of a monitor interface.

Since we already skip AP_VLAN interfaces and MONITOR with
WANT_MONITOR_VIF and/or NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR should update
the settings, catch this in the link change code instead
of the warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38642 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
