Subject: CVE-2025-40021: tracing: dynevent: Add a missing lockdown check on dynevent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: dynevent: Add a missing lockdown check on dynevent

Since dynamic_events interface on tracefs is compatible with
kprobe_events and uprobe_events, it should also check the lockdown
status and reject if it is set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
