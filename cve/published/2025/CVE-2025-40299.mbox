Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: Implement gettimex64 with -EOPNOTSUPP

gve implemented a ptp_clock for sole use of do_aux_work at this time.
ptp_clock_gettime() and ptp_sys_offset() assume every ptp_clock has
implemented either gettimex64 or gettime64. Stub gettimex64 and return
-EOPNOTSUPP to prevent NULL dereferencing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40299 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96ec90412ceb58c73fd3714e40ab2cee1eedac3b
