Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix out-of-bounds in parse_sec_desc()

If osidoffset, gsidoffset and dacloffset could be greater than smb_ntsd
struct size. If it is smaller, It could cause slab-out-of-bounds.
And when validating sid, It need to check it included subauth array size.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
