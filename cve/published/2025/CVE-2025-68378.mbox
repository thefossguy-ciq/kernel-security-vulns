Subject: CVE-2025-68378: bpf: Fix stackmap overflow check in __bpf_get_stackid()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix stackmap overflow check in __bpf_get_stackid()

Syzkaller reported a KASAN slab-out-of-bounds write in __bpf_get_stackid()
when copying stack trace data. The issue occurs when the perf trace
 contains more stack entries than the stack map bucket can hold,
 leading to an out-of-bounds write in the bucket's data array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68378 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
