Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Fix NULL dereference in SR-IOV VF creation error path

Clean up when virtfn setup fails to prevent NULL pointer dereference
during device removal. The kernel oops below occurred due to incorrect
error handling flow when pci_setup_device() fails.

Add pci_iov_scan_device(), which handles virtfn allocation and setup and
cleans up if pci_setup_device() fails, so pci_iov_add_virtfn() doesn't need
to call pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device().  This prevents accessing
partially initialized virtfn devices during removal.

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000d0
  RIP: 0010:device_del+0x3d/0x3d0
  Call Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
