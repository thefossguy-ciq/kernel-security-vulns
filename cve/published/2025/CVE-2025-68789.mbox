Subject: CVE-2025-68789: hwmon: (ibmpex) fix use-after-free in high/low store

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ibmpex) fix use-after-free in high/low store

The ibmpex_high_low_store() function retrieves driver data using
dev_get_drvdata() and uses it without validation. This creates a race
condition where the sysfs callback can be invoked after the data
structure is freed, leading to use-after-free.

Fix by adding a NULL check after dev_get_drvdata(), and reordering
operations in the deletion path to prevent TOCTOU.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-68789 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
