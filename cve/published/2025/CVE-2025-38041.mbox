Subject: CVE-2025-38041: clk: sunxi-ng: h616: Reparent GPU clock during frequency changes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: h616: Reparent GPU clock during frequency changes

The H616 manual does not state that the GPU PLL supports
dynamic frequency configuration, so we must take extra care when changing
the frequency. Currently any attempt to do device DVFS on the GPU lead
to panfrost various ooops, and GPU hangs.

The manual describes the algorithm for changing the PLL
frequency, which the CPU PLL notifier code already support, so we reuse
that to reparent the GPU clock to GPU1 clock during frequency
changes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38041 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1439673b78185eaaa5fae444b3a9d58c434ee78e
