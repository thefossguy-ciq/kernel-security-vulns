We can pin a tail page of a folio, but then io_uring will try to unpin
the head page of the folio. While it should be fine in terms of keeping
the page actually alive, mm folks say it's wrong and triggers a debug
warning. Use unpin_user_folio() instead of unpin_user_page*.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
