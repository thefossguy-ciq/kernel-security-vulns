Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: dummy: force synchronous probing

Sometimes I get a NULL pointer dereference at boot time in kobject_get()
with the following call stack:

anatop_regulator_probe()
 devm_regulator_register()
  regulator_register()
   regulator_resolve_supply()
    kobject_get()

By placing some extra BUG_ON() statements I could verify that this is
raised because probing of the 'dummy' regulator driver is not completed
('dummy_regulator_rdev' is still NULL).

In the JTAG debugger I can see that dummy_regulator_probe() and
anatop_regulator_probe() can be run by different kernel threads
(kworker/u4:*).  I haven't further investigated whether this can be
changed or if there are other possibilities to force synchronization
between these two probe routines.  On the other hand I don't expect much
boot time penalty by probing the 'dummy' regulator synchronously.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22009 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
