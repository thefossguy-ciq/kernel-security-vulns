Subject: CVE-2025-38162: netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size, ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2, worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8, worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long), from sizeof(*f->lt), lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then, use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally, add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it, replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency, in pipapo_resize().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38162 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
