Subject: CVE-2025-40213: Bluetooth: MGMT: fix crash in set_mesh_sync and set_mesh_complete

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: MGMT: fix crash in set_mesh_sync and set_mesh_complete

There is a BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in set_mesh_sync due to
memcpy from badly declared on-stack flexible array.

Another crash is in set_mesh_complete() due to double list_del via
mgmt_pending_valid + mgmt_pending_remove.

Use DEFINE_FLEX to declare the flexible array right, and don't memcpy
outside bounds.

As mgmt_pending_valid removes the cmd from list, use mgmt_pending_free,
and also report status on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40213 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
