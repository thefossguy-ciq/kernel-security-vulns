Subject: CVE-2025-38726: net: ftgmac100: fix potential NULL pointer access in ftgmac100_phy_disconnect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ftgmac100: fix potential NULL pointer access in ftgmac100_phy_disconnect

After the call to phy_disconnect() netdev->phydev is reset to NULL.
So fixed_phy_unregister() would be called with a NULL pointer as argument.
Therefore cache the phy_device before this call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38726 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
