Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs3: pretend $Extend records as regular files

Since commit af153bb63a33 ("vfs: catch invalid modes in may_open()")
requires any inode be one of S_IFDIR/S_IFLNK/S_IFREG/S_IFCHR/S_IFBLK/
S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK type, use S_IFREG for $Extend records.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40313 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
