Subject: CVE-2025-37830: cpufreq: scmi: Fix null-ptr-deref in scmi_cpufreq_get_rate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: scmi: Fix null-ptr-deref in scmi_cpufreq_get_rate()

cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() can return NULL when the target CPU is not present
in the policy->cpus mask. scmi_cpufreq_get_rate() does not check for
this case, which results in a NULL pointer dereference.

Add NULL check after cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() to prevent this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37830 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
