Subject: CVE-2025-68261: ext4: add i_data_sem protection in ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add i_data_sem protection in ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock()

Fix a race between inline data destruction and block mapping.

The function ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() changes the inode data
layout by clearing EXT4_INODE_INLINE_DATA and setting EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS.
At the same time, another thread may execute ext4_map_blocks(), which
tests EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS to decide whether to call ext4_ext_map_blocks()
or ext4_ind_map_blocks().

Without i_data_sem protection, ext4_ind_map_blocks() may receive inode
with EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS flag and triggering assert.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
