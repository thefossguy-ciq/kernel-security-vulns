Subject: CVE-2025-38135: serial: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in mlb_usio_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in mlb_usio_probe()

devm_ioremap() can return NULL on error. Currently, mlb_usio_probe()
does not check for this case, which could result in a NULL pointer
dereference.

Add NULL check after devm_ioremap() to prevent this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38135 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
