Subject: CVE-2025-71083: drm/ttm: Avoid NULL pointer deref for evicted BOs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/ttm: Avoid NULL pointer deref for evicted BOs

It is possible for a BO to exist that is not currently associated with a
resource, e.g. because it has been evicted.

When devcoredump tries to read the contents of all BOs for dumping, we need
to expect this as well -- in this case, ENODATA is recorded instead of the
buffer contents.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-71083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
