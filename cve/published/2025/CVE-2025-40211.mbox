Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()

The switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device->brightness
and device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()
during device removal.

If the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()
frees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when
acpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device->brightness or
device->backlight.

Fix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's
switch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()
after removing the notify handler that queues the work. This ensures
the work completes before the memory is freed.

[ rjw: Changelog edit ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40211 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
