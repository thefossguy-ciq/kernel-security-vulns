Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/deadline: Stop dl_server before CPU goes offline

IBM CI tool reported kernel warning[1] when running a CPU removal
operation through drmgr[2]. i.e "drmgr -c cpu -r -q 1"

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/cpudeadline.c:219 cpudl_set+0x58/0x170
NIP [c0000000002b6ed8] cpudl_set+0x58/0x170

Call Trace:

[c00000000002a230] timer_interrupt+0x140/0x320

Git bisects to: commit 4ae8d9aa9f9d ("sched/deadline: Fix dl_server getting stuck")

This happens since:
- dl_server hrtimer gets enqueued close to cpu offline, when
  kthread_park enqueues a fair task.
- CPU goes offline and drmgr removes it from cpu_present_mask.
- hrtimer fires and warning is hit.

Fix it by stopping the dl_server before CPU is marked dead.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/sched/core.c
	kernel/sched/deadline.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab6c0f158508bb16d483add70b73a73f95651c33
