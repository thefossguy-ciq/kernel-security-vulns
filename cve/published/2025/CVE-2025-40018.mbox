Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvs: Defer ip_vs_ftp unregister during netns cleanup

On the netns cleanup path, __ip_vs_ftp_exit() may unregister ip_vs_ftp
before connections with valid cp->app pointers are flushed, leading to a
use-after-free.

Fix this by introducing a global `exiting_module` flag, set to true in
ip_vs_ftp_exit() before unregistering the pernet subsystem. In
__ip_vs_ftp_exit(), skip ip_vs_ftp unregister if called during netns
cleanup (when exiting_module is false) and defer it to
__ip_vs_cleanup_batch(), which unregisters all apps after all connections
are flushed. If called during module exit, unregister ip_vs_ftp
immediately.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40018 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
