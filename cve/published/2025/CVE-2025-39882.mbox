Subject: CVE-2025-39882: drm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: fix potential OF node use-after-free

The for_each_child_of_node() helper drops the reference it takes to each
node as it iterates over children and an explicit of_node_put() is only
needed when exiting the loop early.

Drop the recently introduced bogus additional reference count decrement
at each iteration that could potentially lead to a use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39882 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
