Subject: CVE-2025-38430: nfsd: nfsd4_spo_must_allow() must check this is a v4 compound request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: nfsd4_spo_must_allow() must check this is a v4 compound request

If the request being processed is not a v4 compound request, then
examining the cstate can have undefined results.

This patch adds a check that the rpc procedure being executed
(rq_procinfo) is the NFSPROC4_COMPOUND procedure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38430 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
