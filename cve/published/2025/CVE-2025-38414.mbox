Subject: CVE-2025-38414: wifi: ath12k: fix GCC_GCC_PCIE_HOT_RST definition for WCN7850

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix GCC_GCC_PCIE_HOT_RST definition for WCN7850

GCC_GCC_PCIE_HOT_RST is wrongly defined for WCN7850, causing kernel crash
on some specific platforms.

Since this register is divergent for WCN7850 and QCN9274, move it to
register table to allow different definitions. Then correct the register
address for WCN7850 to fix this issue.

Note IPQ5332 is not affected as it is not PCIe based device.

Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38414 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
