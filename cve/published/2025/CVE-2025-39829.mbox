Subject: CVE-2025-39829: trace/fgraph: Fix the warning caused by missing unregister notifier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

trace/fgraph: Fix the warning caused by missing unregister notifier

This warning was triggered during testing on v6.16:

notifier callback ftrace_suspend_notifier_call already registered
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 86 at kernel/notifier.c:23 notifier_chain_register+0x44/0xb0
...
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 do_syscall_64+0xa4/0x260
 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f

When writing to the function_profile_enabled interface, the notifier was
not unregistered after start_graph_tracing failed, causing a warning the
next time function_profile_enabled was written.

Fixed by adding unregister_pm_notifier in the exception path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39829 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
