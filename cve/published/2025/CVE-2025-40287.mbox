Subject: CVE-2025-40287: exfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size

We found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a
Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is
malformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and
SYS_pwrite64 — can cause the kernel to hang.

Root cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()
does not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,
the system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS
issue.

This patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent
this vulnerability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40287 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
