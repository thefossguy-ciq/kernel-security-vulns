Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix mode1 reset crash issue

If HW scheduler hangs and mode1 reset is used to recover GPU, KFD signal
user space to abort the processes. After process abort exit, user queues
still use the GPU to access system memory before h/w is reset while KFD
cleanup worker free system memory and free VRAM.

There is use-after-free race bug that KFD allocate and reuse the freed
system memory, and user queue write to the same system memory to corrupt
the data structure and cause driver crash.

To fix this race, KFD cleanup worker terminate user queues, then flush
reset_domain wq to wait for any GPU ongoing reset complete, and then
free outstanding BOs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37854 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
