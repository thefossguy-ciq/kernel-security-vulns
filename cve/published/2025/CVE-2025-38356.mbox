Subject: CVE-2025-38356: drm/xe/guc: Explicitly exit CT safe mode on unwind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc: Explicitly exit CT safe mode on unwind

During driver probe we might be briefly using CT safe mode, which
is based on a delayed work, but usually we are able to stop this
once we have IRQ fully operational.  However, if we abort the probe
quite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue
while there is still a pending delayed work that attempts to restart
itself which triggers a WARN.

This was recently observed during unsuccessful VF initialization:

 [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: probe with driver xe failed with error -62
 [ ] ------------[ cut here ]------------
 [ ] workqueue: cannot queue safe_mode_worker_func [xe] on wq xe-g2h-wq
 [ ] WARNING: CPU: 9 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2257 __queue_work+0x287/0x710
 [ ] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x287/0x710
 [ ] Call Trace:
 [ ]  delayed_work_timer_fn+0x19/0x30
 [ ]  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2a0

Exit the CT safe mode on unwind to avoid that warning.

(cherry picked from commit 2ddbb73ec20b98e70a5200cb85deade22ccea2ec)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38356 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
