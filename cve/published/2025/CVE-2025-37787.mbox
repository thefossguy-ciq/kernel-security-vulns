Subject: CVE-2025-37787: net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond && !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.

To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
