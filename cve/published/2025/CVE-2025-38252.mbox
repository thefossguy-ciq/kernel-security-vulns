Subject: CVE-2025-38252: cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile
assumptions that can lead to crashes:

1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3
   device, nothing guarantees that.

2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing
   guarantees that.

3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no
   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.

Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev
before assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where
it is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for
CXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38252 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4bcb8dd36e9e3fad6c22862ac5b6993df838309b
