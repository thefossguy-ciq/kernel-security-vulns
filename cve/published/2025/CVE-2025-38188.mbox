Subject: CVE-2025-38188: drm/msm/a7xx: Call CP_RESET_CONTEXT_STATE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a7xx: Call CP_RESET_CONTEXT_STATE

Calling this packet is necessary when we switch contexts because there
are various pieces of state used by userspace to synchronize between BR
and BV that are persistent across submits and we need to make sure that
they are in a "safe" state when switching contexts. Otherwise a
userspace submission in one context could cause another context to
function incorrectly and hang, effectively a denial of service (although
without leaking data). This was missed during initial a7xx bringup.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
