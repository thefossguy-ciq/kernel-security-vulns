Subject: CVE-2025-39858: eth: mlx4: Fix IS_ERR() vs NULL check bug in mlx4_en_create_rx_ring

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: mlx4: Fix IS_ERR() vs NULL check bug in mlx4_en_create_rx_ring

Replace NULL check with IS_ERR() check after calling page_pool_create()
since this function returns error pointers (ERR_PTR).
Using NULL check could lead to invalid pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39858 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
