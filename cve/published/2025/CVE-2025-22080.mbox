Subject: CVE-2025-22080: fs/ntfs3: Prevent integer overflow in hdr_first_de()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Prevent integer overflow in hdr_first_de()

The "de_off" and "used" variables come from the disk so they both need to
check.  The problem is that on 32bit systems if they're both greater than
UINT_MAX - 16 then the check does work as intended because of an integer
overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-22080 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
