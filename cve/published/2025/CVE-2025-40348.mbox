Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: Avoid race on slab->obj_exts in alloc_slab_obj_exts

If two competing threads enter alloc_slab_obj_exts() and one of them
fails to allocate the object extension vector, it might override the
valid slab->obj_exts allocated by the other thread with
OBJEXTS_ALLOC_FAIL. This will cause the thread that lost this race and
expects a valid pointer to dereference a NULL pointer later on.

Update slab->obj_exts atomically using cmpxchg() to avoid
slab->obj_exts overrides by racing threads.

Thanks for Vlastimil and Suren's help with debugging.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40348 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
