Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: at76c50x: fix use after free access in at76_disconnect

The memory pointed to by priv is freed at the end of at76_delete_device
function (using ieee80211_free_hw). But the code then accesses the udev
field of the freed object to put the USB device. This may also lead to a
memory leak of the usb device. Fix this by using udev from interface.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-37796 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
