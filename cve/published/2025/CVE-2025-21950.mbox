Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: virt: acrn: hsm: Use kzalloc to avoid info leak in pmcmd_ioctl

In the "pmcmd_ioctl" function, three memory objects allocated by
kmalloc are initialized by "hcall_get_cpu_state", which are then
copied to user space. The initializer is indeed implemented in
"acrn_hypercall2" (arch/x86/include/asm/acrn.h). There is a risk of
information leakage due to uninitialized bytes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
