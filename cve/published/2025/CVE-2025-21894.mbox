Subject: CVE-2025-21894: net: enetc: VFs do not support HWTSTAMP_TX_ONESTEP_SYNC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: enetc: VFs do not support HWTSTAMP_TX_ONESTEP_SYNC

Actually ENETC VFs do not support HWTSTAMP_TX_ONESTEP_SYNC because only
ENETC PF can access PMa_SINGLE_STEP registers. And there will be a crash
if VFs are used to test one-step timestamp, the crash log as follows.

[  129.110909] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000000080c0
[  129.287769] Call trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
