Subject: CVE-2025-39997: ALSA: usb-audio: fix race condition to UAF in snd_usbmidi_free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: fix race condition to UAF in snd_usbmidi_free

The previous commit 0718a78f6a9f ("ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at
removal") patched a UAF issue caused by the error timer.

However, because the error timer kill added in this patch occurs after the
endpoint delete, a race condition to UAF still occurs, albeit rarely.

Additionally, since kill-cleanup for urb is also missing, freed memory can
be accessed in interrupt context related to urb, which can cause UAF.

Therefore, to prevent this, error timer and urb must be killed before
freeing the heap memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
