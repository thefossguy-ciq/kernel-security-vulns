Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn->n samples

The `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for
`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for
`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default
handler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler
for `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed
`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`
instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,
indicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently
only handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will
copy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASAN
kernel-infoleak errors when `insn->n` was greater than 1, but that is
being fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)

Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn->n` samples, or return
an error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and
`INSN_WRITE` handlers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
