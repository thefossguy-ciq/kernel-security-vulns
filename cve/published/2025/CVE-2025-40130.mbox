Subject: CVE-2025-40130: scsi: ufs: core: Fix data race in CPU latency PM QoS request handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix data race in CPU latency PM QoS request handling

The cpu_latency_qos_add/remove/update_request interfaces lack internal
synchronization by design, requiring the caller to ensure thread safety.
The current implementation relies on the 'pm_qos_enabled' flag, which is
insufficient to prevent concurrent access and cannot serve as a proper
synchronization mechanism. This has led to data races and list
corruption issues.

A typical race condition call trace is:

[Thread A]
ufshcd_pm_qos_exit()
  --> cpu_latency_qos_remove_request()
    --> cpu_latency_qos_apply();
      --> pm_qos_update_target()
        --> plist_del              <--(1) delete plist node
    --> memset(req, 0, sizeof(*req));
  --> hba->pm_qos_enabled = false;

[Thread B]
ufshcd_devfreq_target
  --> ufshcd_devfreq_scale
    --> ufshcd_scale_clks
      --> ufshcd_pm_qos_update     <--(2) pm_qos_enabled is true
        --> cpu_latency_qos_update_request
          --> pm_qos_update_target
            --> plist_del          <--(3) plist node use-after-free

Introduces a dedicated mutex to serialize PM QoS operations, preventing
data races and ensuring safe access to PM QoS resources, including sysfs
interface reads.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40130 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/ufs/core/ufs-sysfs.c
	drivers/ufs/core/ufshcd.c
	include/ufs/ufshcd.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9df61afb8d23c475f1be3c714da2c34c156ab01
