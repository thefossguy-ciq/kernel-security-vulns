Subject: CVE-2025-21874: dm-integrity: Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-integrity: Avoid divide by zero in table status in Inline mode

In Inline mode, the journal is unused, and journal_sectors is zero.

Calculating the journal watermark requires dividing by journal_sectors,
which should be done only if the journal is configured.

Otherwise, a simple table query (dmsetup table) can cause OOPS.

This bug did not show on some systems, perhaps only due to
compiler optimization.

On my 32-bit testing machine, this reliably crashes with the following:

 : Oops: divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
 : CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 2450 Comm: dmsetup Not tainted 6.14.0-rc2+ #959
 : EIP: dm_integrity_status+0x2f8/0xab0 [dm_integrity]
 ...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21874 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
