Subject: CVE-2023-53811: RDMA/irdma: Cap MSIX used to online CPUs + 1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Cap MSIX used to online CPUs + 1

The irdma driver can use a maximum number of msix vectors equal
to num_online_cpus() + 1 and the kernel warning stack below is shown
if that number is exceeded.

The kernel throws a warning as the driver tries to update the affinity
hint with a CPU mask greater than the max CPU IDs. Fix this by capping
the MSIX vectors to num_online_cpus() + 1.

 WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 23655 at include/linux/cpumask.h:106 irdma_cfg_ceq_vector+0x34c/0x3f0 [irdma]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
