Subject: CVE-2023-53669: tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: fix skb_copy_ubufs() vs BIG TCP

David Ahern reported crashes in skb_copy_ubufs() caused by TCP tx zerocopy
using hugepages, and skb length bigger than ~68 KB.

skb_copy_ubufs() assumed it could copy all payload using up to
MAX_SKB_FRAGS order-0 pages.

This assumption broke when BIG TCP was able to put up to 512 KB per skb.

We did not hit this bug at Google because we use CONFIG_MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45
and limit gso_max_size to 180000.

A solution is to use higher order pages if needed.

v2: add missing __GFP_COMP, or we leak memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53669 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
