Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix memory leak when showing current settings

When retriving a item string with tlmi_setting(), the result has to be
freed using kfree(). In current_value_show() however, malformed
item strings are not freed, causing a memory leak.
Fix this by eliminating the early return responsible for this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53830 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
