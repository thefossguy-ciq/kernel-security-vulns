Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: Do not bother merging very long extents

When merging very long extents we try to push as much length as possible
to the first extent. However this is unnecessarily complicated and not
really worth the trouble. Furthermore there was a bug in the logic
resulting in corrupting extents in the file as syzbot reproducer shows.
So just don't bother with the merging of extents that are too long
together.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53506 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
