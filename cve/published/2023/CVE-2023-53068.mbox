Subject: CVE-2023-53068: net: usb: lan78xx: Limit packet length to skb->len

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: lan78xx: Limit packet length to skb->len

Packet length retrieved from descriptor may be larger than
the actual socket buffer length. In such case the cloned
skb passed up the network stack will leak kernel memory contents.

Additionally prevent integer underflow when size is less than
ETH_FCS_LEN.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
