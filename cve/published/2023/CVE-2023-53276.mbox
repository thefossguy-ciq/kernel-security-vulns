Subject: CVE-2023-53276: ubifs: Free memory for tmpfile name

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Free memory for tmpfile name

When opening a ubifs tmpfile on an encrypted directory, function
fscrypt_setup_filename allocates memory for the name that is to be
stored in the directory entry, but after the name has been copied to the
directory entry inode, the memory is not freed.

When running kmemleak on it we see that it is registered as a leak. The
report below is triggered by a simple program 'tmpfile' just opening a
tmpfile:

  unreferenced object 0xffff88810178f380 (size 32):
    comm "tmpfile", pid 509, jiffies 4294934744 (age 1524.742s)
    backtrace:
      __kmem_cache_alloc_node
      __kmalloc
      fscrypt_setup_filename
      ubifs_tmpfile
      vfs_tmpfile
      path_openat

Free this memory after it has been copied to the inode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
