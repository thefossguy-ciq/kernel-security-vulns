Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hsr: Prevent use after free in prp_create_tagged_frame()

The prp_fill_rct() function can fail.  In that situation, it frees the
skb and returns NULL.  Meanwhile on the success path, it returns the
original skb.  So it's straight forward to fix bug by using the returned
value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52846 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
