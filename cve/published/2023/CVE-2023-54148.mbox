Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Move representor neigh cleanup to profile cleanup_tx

For IP tunnel encapsulation in ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath) mode, as
the flow is duplicated to the peer eswitch, the related neighbour
information on the peer uplink representor is created as well.

In the cited commit, eswitch devcom unpair is moved to uplink unload
API, specifically the profile->cleanup_tx. If there is a encap rule
offloaded in ECMP mode, when one eswitch does unpair (because of
unloading the driver, for instance), and the peer rule from the peer
eswitch is going to be deleted, the use-after-free error is triggered
while accessing neigh info, as it is already cleaned up in uplink's
profile->disable, which is before its profile->cleanup_tx.

To fix this issue, move the neigh cleanup to profile's cleanup_tx
callback, and after mlx5e_cleanup_uplink_rep_tx is called. The neigh
init is moved to init_tx for symmeter.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
