Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix possible UAF in amdgpu_cs_pass1()

Since the gang_size check is outside of chunk parsing
loop, we need to reset i before we free the chunk data.

Suggested by Ye Zhang (@VAR10CK) of Baidu Security.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52921 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.46 with commit 9a2393af1f35
	Fixed in 6.4.11 with commit e08e9dd09809
	Fixed in 6.5 with commit 90e065677e03

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-52921
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
