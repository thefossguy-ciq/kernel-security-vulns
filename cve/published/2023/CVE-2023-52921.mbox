Subject: CVE-2023-52921: drm/amdgpu: fix possible UAF in amdgpu_cs_pass1()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix possible UAF in amdgpu_cs_pass1()

Since the gang_size check is outside of chunk parsing
loop, we need to reset i before we free the chunk data.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
