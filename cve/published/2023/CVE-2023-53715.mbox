Subject: CVE-2023-53715: wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: cfg80211: Pass the PMK in binary instead of hex

Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer
chips/firmware (e.g. BCM4387). It seems there was a simple way of
passing it in binary all along, so use that and avoid the hexification.

OpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should
work on all chips.

Also clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking
uninitialized stack contents to the device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
