Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/sprd: Release dma buffer to avoid memory leak

is used to store address mapping table, and it need to be released
when the IOMMU domain is freed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
