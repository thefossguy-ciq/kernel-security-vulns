Subject: CVE-2023-53275: ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: fix a possible null-pointer dereference due to data race in snd_hdac_regmap_sync()

The variable codec->regmap is often protected by the lock
codec->regmap_lock when is accessed. However, it is accessed without
holding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():

  if (codec->regmap)

In my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is
set to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer
dereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():

  map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c

To fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the
mutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the
function call to regcache_sync().

[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current
  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for
  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.
  But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged
  as is -- tiwai ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53275 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
