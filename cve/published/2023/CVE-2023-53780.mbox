Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix FCLK pstate change underflow

[Why]
Currently we set FCLK p-state change
watermark calculated based on dummy
p-state latency when UCLK p-state is
not supported

[How]
Calculate FCLK p-state change watermark
based on on FCLK pstate change latency
in case UCLK p-state is not supported

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53780 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4bdfa48d74649898468a0bf5c8b8a48dded77b4a
