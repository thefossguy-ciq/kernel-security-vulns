Subject: CVE-2023-53493: accel/qaic: tighten bounds checking in decode_message()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: tighten bounds checking in decode_message()

Copy the bounds checking from encode_message() to decode_message().

This patch addresses the following concerns.  Ensure that there is
enough space for at least one header so that we don't have a negative
size later.

	if (msg_hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))

Ensure that we have enough space to read the next header from the
msg->data.

	if (msg_len > msg_hdr_len - sizeof(*trans_hdr))
		return -EINVAL;

Check that the trans_hdr->len is not below the minimum size:

	if (hdr_len < sizeof(*trans_hdr))

This minimum check ensures that we don't corrupt memory in
decode_passthrough() when we do.

	memcpy(out_trans->data, in_trans->data, len - sizeof(in_trans->hdr));

And finally, use size_add() to prevent an integer overflow:

	if (size_add(msg_len, hdr_len) > msg_hdr_len)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53493 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57d14cb3bae4619ce2fb5235cb318c3d5d8f53fd
