Subject: CVE-2023-53769: virt/coco/sev-guest: Double-buffer messages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virt/coco/sev-guest: Double-buffer messages

The encryption algorithms read and write directly to shared unencrypted
memory, which may leak information as well as permit the host to tamper
with the message integrity. Instead, copy whole messages in or out as
needed before doing any computation on them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53769 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
