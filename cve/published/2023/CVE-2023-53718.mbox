Subject: CVE-2023-53718: ring-buffer: Do not swap cpu_buffer during resize process

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ring-buffer: Do not swap cpu_buffer during resize process

When ring_buffer_swap_cpu was called during resize process,
the cpu buffer was swapped in the middle, resulting in incorrect state.
Continuing to run in the wrong state will result in oops.

This issue can be easily reproduced using the following two scripts:
/tmp # cat test1.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
         echo 2000 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
         sleep 0.5
         echo 5000 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/buffer_size_kb
         sleep 0.5
done
/tmp # cat test2.sh
//#! /bin/sh
for i in `seq 0 100000`
do
        echo irqsoff > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
        sleep 1
        echo nop > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current_tracer
        sleep 1
done
/tmp # ./test1.sh &
/tmp # ./test2.sh &

A typical oops log is as follows, sometimes with other different oops logs.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
