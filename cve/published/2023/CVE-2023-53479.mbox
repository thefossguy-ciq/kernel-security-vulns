Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/acpi: Fix a use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws()

KASAN and KFENCE detected an user-after-free in the CXL driver. This
happens in the cxl_decoder_add() fail path. KASAN prints the following
error:

   BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in cxl_parse_cfmws (drivers/cxl/acpi.c:299)

This happens in cxl_parse_cfmws(), where put_device() is called,
releasing cxld, which is accessed later.

Use the local variables in the dev_err() instead of pointing to the
released memory. Since the dev_err() is printing a resource, change the open
coded print format to use the %pr format specifier.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53479 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
