Subject: CVE-2023-54153: ext4: turn quotas off if mount failed after enabling quotas

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: turn quotas off if mount failed after enabling quotas

Yi found during a review of the patch "ext4: don't BUG on inconsistent
journal feature" that when ext4_mark_recovery_complete() returns an error
value, the error handling path does not turn off the enabled quotas,
which triggers the following kmemleak:

================================================================

To solve this problem, we add a "failed_mount10" tag, and call
ext4_quota_off_umount() in this tag to release the enabled qoutas.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
