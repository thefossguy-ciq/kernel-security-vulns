Subject: CVE-2023-53570: wifi: nl80211: fix integer overflow in nl80211_parse_mbssid_elems()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: fix integer overflow in nl80211_parse_mbssid_elems()

nl80211_parse_mbssid_elems() uses a u8 variable num_elems to count the
number of MBSSID elements in the nested netlink attribute attrs, which can
lead to an integer overflow if a user of the nl80211 interface specifies
256 or more elements in the corresponding attribute in userspace. The
integer overflow can lead to a heap buffer overflow as num_elems determines
the size of the trailing array in elems, and this array is thereafter
written to for each element in attrs.

Note that this vulnerability only affects devices with the
wiphy->mbssid_max_interfaces member set for the wireless physical device
struct in the device driver, and can only be triggered by a process with
CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.

Fix this by checking for a maximum of 255 elements in attrs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53570 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
