Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: fix NULL-deref on snapshot tear down

In case of early initialisation errors and on platforms that do not use
the DPU controller, the deinitilisation code can be called with the kms
pointer set to NULL.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
