Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: ucsi_acpi: Increase the command completion timeout

Commit 130a96d698d7 ("usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Increase command
completion timeout value") increased the timeout from 5 seconds
to 60 seconds due to issues related to alternate mode discovery.

After the alternate mode discovery switch to polled mode
the timeout was reduced, but instead of being set back to
5 seconds it was reduced to 1 second.

This is causing problems when using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 yoga gen7
connected over Type-C to a LG 27UL850-W (charging DP over Type-C).

When the monitor is already connected at boot the following error
is logged: "PPM init failed (-110)", /sys/class/typec is empty and
on unplugging the NULL pointer deref fixed earlier in this series
happens.

When the monitor is connected after boot the following error
is logged instead: "GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS failed (-110)".

Setting the timeout back to 5 seconds fixes both cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53168 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
