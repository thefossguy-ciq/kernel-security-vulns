Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlx5: fix possible ptp queue fifo use-after-free

Fifo indexes are not checked during pop operations and it leads to
potential use-after-free when poping from empty queue. Such case was
possible during re-sync action. WARN_ON_ONCE covers future cases.

There were out-of-order cqe spotted which lead to drain of the queue and
use-after-free because of lack of fifo pointers check. Special check and
counter are added to avoid resync operation if SKB could not exist in the
fifo because of OOO cqe (skb_id must be between consumer and producer
index).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53398 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
