Subject: CVE-2023-53722: md: raid1: fix potential OOB in raid1_remove_disk()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: raid1: fix potential OOB in raid1_remove_disk()

If rddev->raid_disk is greater than mddev->raid_disks, there will be
an out-of-bounds in raid1_remove_disk(). We have already found
similar reports as follows:

1) commit d17f744e883b ("md-raid10: fix KASAN warning")
2) commit 1ebc2cec0b7d ("dm raid: fix KASAN warning in raid5_remove_disk")

Fix this bug by checking whether the "number" variable is
valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
