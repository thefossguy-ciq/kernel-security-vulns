Subject: CVE-2023-54096: soundwire: fix enumeration completion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: fix enumeration completion

The soundwire subsystem uses two completion structures that allow
drivers to wait for soundwire device to become enumerated on the bus and
initialised by their drivers, respectively.

The code implementing the signalling is currently broken as it does not
signal all current and future waiters and also uses the wrong
reinitialisation function, which can potentially lead to memory
corruption if there are still waiters on the queue.

Not signalling future waiters specifically breaks sound card probe
deferrals as codec drivers can not tell that the soundwire device is
already attached when being reprobed. Some codec runtime PM
implementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration
during resume can also timeout despite the device already having been
enumerated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54096 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
