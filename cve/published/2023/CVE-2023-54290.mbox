Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/drivers/mediatek: Use devm_of_iomap to avoid resource leak in mtk_thermal_probe

Smatch reports:
1. mtk_thermal_probe() warn: 'apmixed_base' from of_iomap() not released.
2. mtk_thermal_probe() warn: 'auxadc_base' from of_iomap() not released.

The original code forgets to release iomap resource when handling errors,
fix it by switch to devm_of_iomap.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54290 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
