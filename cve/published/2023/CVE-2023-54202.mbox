Subject: CVE-2023-54202: drm/i915: fix race condition UAF in i915_perf_add_config_ioctl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: fix race condition UAF in i915_perf_add_config_ioctl

Userspace can guess the id value and try to race oa_config object creation
with config remove, resulting in a use-after-free if we dereference the
object after unlocking the metrics_lock.  For that reason, unlocking the
metrics_lock must be done after we are done dereferencing the object.

[tursulin: Manually added stable tag.]
(cherry picked from commit 49f6f6483b652108bcb73accd0204a464b922395)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
