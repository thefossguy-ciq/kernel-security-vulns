Subject: CVE-2023-53833: drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
confirmed to help.

(cherry picked from commit 1d5b09f8daf859247a1ea65b0d732a24d88980d8)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53833 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
