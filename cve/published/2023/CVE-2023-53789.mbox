Subject: CVE-2023-53789: iommu/amd: Improve page fault error reporting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Improve page fault error reporting

If IOMMU domain for device group is not setup properly then we may hit
IOMMU page fault. Current page fault handler assumes that domain is
always setup and it will hit NULL pointer derefence (see below sample log).

Lets check whether domain is setup or not and log appropriate message.

Sample log:
----------
 amdgpu 0000:00:01.0: amdgpu: SE 1, SH per SE 1, CU per SH 8, active_cu_number 6
 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
