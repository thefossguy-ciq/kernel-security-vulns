Subject: CVE-2023-53019: net: mdio: validate parameter addr in mdiobus_get_phy()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mdio: validate parameter addr in mdiobus_get_phy()

The caller may pass any value as addr, what may result in an out-of-bounds
access to array mdio_map. One existing case is stmmac_init_phy() that
may pass -1 as addr. Therefore validate addr before using it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53019 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
