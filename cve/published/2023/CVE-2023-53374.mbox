Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_conn: fail SCO/ISO via hci_conn_failed if ACL gone early

Not calling hci_(dis)connect_cfm before deleting conn referred to by a
socket generally results to use-after-free.

When cleaning up SCO connections when the parent ACL is deleted too
early, use hci_conn_failed to do the connection cleanup properly.

We also need to clean up ISO connections in a similar situation when
connecting has started but LE Create CIS is not yet sent, so do it too
here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53374 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
