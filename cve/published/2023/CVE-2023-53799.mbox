Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: api - Use work queue in crypto_destroy_instance

The function crypto_drop_spawn expects to be called in process
context.  However, when an instance is unregistered while it still
has active users, the last user may cause the instance to be freed
in atomic context.

Fix this by delaying the freeing to a work queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53799 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
