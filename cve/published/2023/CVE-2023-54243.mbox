Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ebtables: fix table blob use-after-free

We are not allowed to return an error at this point.
Looking at the code it looks like ret is always 0 at this
point, but its not.

t = find_table_lock(net, repl->name, &ret, &ebt_mutex);

... this can return a valid table, with ret != 0.

This bug causes update of table->private with the new
blob, but then frees the blob right away in the caller.

Syzbot report:

BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in __ebt_unregister_table+0xc00/0xcd0 net/bridge/netfilter/ebtables.c:1168
Read of size 4 at addr ffffc90005425000 by task kworker/u4:4/74
Workqueue: netns cleanup_net
Call Trace:

ip(6)tables appears to be ok (ret should be 0 at this point) but make
this more obvious.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54243 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
