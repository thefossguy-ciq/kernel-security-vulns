Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: host: Range check CHDBOFF and ERDBOFF

If the value read from the CHDBOFF and ERDBOFF registers is outside the
range of the MHI register space then an invalid address might be computed
which later causes a kernel panic.  Range check the read value to prevent
a crash due to bad data from the device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53598 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
