Subject: CVE-2023-53444: drm/ttm: fix bulk_move corruption when adding a entry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/ttm: fix bulk_move corruption when adding a entry

When the resource is the first in the bulk_move range, adding it again
(thus moving it to the tail) will corrupt the list since the first
pointer is not moved. This eventually lead to null pointer deref in
ttm_lru_bulk_move_del()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53444 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
