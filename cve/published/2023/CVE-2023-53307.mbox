Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rbd: avoid use-after-free in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails

If getting an ID or setting up a work queue in rbd_dev_create() fails,
use-after-free on rbd_dev->rbd_client, rbd_dev->spec and rbd_dev->opts
is triggered in do_rbd_add().  The root cause is that the ownership of
these structures is transfered to rbd_dev prematurely and they all end
up getting freed when rbd_dev_create() calls rbd_dev_free() prior to
returning to do_rbd_add().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE, an
incomplete patch submitted by Natalia Petrova <n.petrova@fintech.ru>.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
