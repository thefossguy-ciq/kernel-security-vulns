Subject: CVE-2023-53336: media: ipu-bridge: Fix null pointer deref on SSDB/PLD parsing warnings

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ipu-bridge: Fix null pointer deref on SSDB/PLD parsing warnings

When ipu_bridge_parse_rotation() and ipu_bridge_parse_orientation() run
sensor->adev is not set yet.

So if either of the dev_warn() calls about unknown values are hit this
will lead to a NULL pointer deref.

Set sensor->adev earlier, with a borrowed ref to avoid making unrolling
on errors harder, to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53336 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
