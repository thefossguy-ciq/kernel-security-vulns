Subject: CVE-2023-54280: cifs: fix potential race when tree connecting ipc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix potential race when tree connecting ipc

Protect access of TCP_Server_Info::hostname when building the ipc tree
name as it might get freed in cifsd thread and thus causing an
use-after-free bug in __tree_connect_dfs_target().  Also, while at it,
update status of IPC tcon on success and then avoid any extra tree
connects.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54280 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
