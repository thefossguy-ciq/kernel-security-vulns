Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix potential use-after-free bugs in TCP_Server_Info::hostname

TCP_Server_Info::hostname may be updated once or many times during
reconnect, so protect its access outside reconnect path as well and
then prevent any potential use-after-free bugs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53751 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
