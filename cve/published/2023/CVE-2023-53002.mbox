Subject: CVE-2023-53002: drm/i915: Fix a memory leak with reused mmap_offset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix a memory leak with reused mmap_offset

drm_vma_node_allow() and drm_vma_node_revoke() should be called in
balanced pairs. We call drm_vma_node_allow() once per-file everytime a
user calls mmap_offset, but only call drm_vma_node_revoke once per-file
on each mmap_offset. As the mmap_offset is reused by the client, the
per-file vm_count may remain non-zero and the rbtree leaked.

Call drm_vma_node_allow_once() instead to prevent that memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0bdc4b4ba7206c452ee81c82fa66e39d0e1780fb
