Subject: CVE-2023-53382: net/smc: Reset connection when trying to use SMCRv2 fails.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Reset connection when trying to use SMCRv2 fails.

We found a crash when using SMCRv2 with 2 Mellanox ConnectX-4. It
can be reproduced by:

- smc_run nginx
- smc_run wrk -t 32 -c 500 -d 30 http://<ip>:<port>

During the CLC handshake, server sequentially tries available SMCRv2
and SMCRv1 devices in smc_listen_work().

If an SMCRv2 device is found. SMCv2 based link group and link will be
assigned to the connection. Then assumed that some buffer assignment
errors happen later in the CLC handshake, such as RMB registration
failure, server will give up SMCRv2 and try SMCRv1 device instead. But
the resources assigned to the connection won't be reset.

When server tries SMCRv1 device, the connection creation process will
be executed again. Since conn->lnk has been assigned when trying SMCRv2,
it will not be set to the correct SMCRv1 link in
smcr_lgr_conn_assign_link(). So in such situation, conn->lgr points to
correct SMCRv1 link group but conn->lnk points to the SMCRv2 link
mistakenly.

Then in smc_clc_send_confirm_accept(), conn->rmb_desc->mr[link->link_idx]
will be accessed. Since the link->link_idx is not correct, the related
MR may not have been initialized, so crash happens.

 | Try SMCRv2 device first
 |     |-> conn->lgr:	assign existed SMCRv2 link group;
 |     |-> conn->link:	assign existed SMCRv2 link (link_idx may be 1 in SMC_LGR_SYMMETRIC);
 |     |-> sndbuf & RMB creation fails, quit;
 |
 | Try SMCRv1 device then
 |     |-> conn->lgr:	create SMCRv1 link group and assign;
 |     |-> conn->link:	keep SMCRv2 link mistakenly;
 |     |-> sndbuf & RMB creation succeed, only RMB->mr[link_idx = 0]
 |         initialized.
 |
 | Then smc_clc_send_confirm_accept() accesses
 | conn->rmb_desc->mr[conn->link->link_idx, which is 1], then crash.
 v

This patch tries to fix this by cleaning conn->lnk before assigning
link. In addition, it is better to reset the connection and clean the
resources assigned if trying SMCRv2 failed in buffer creation or
registration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53382 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
