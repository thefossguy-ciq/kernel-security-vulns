Subject: CVE-2023-53513: nbd: fix incomplete validation of ioctl arg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: fix incomplete validation of ioctl arg

We tested and found an alarm caused by nbd_ioctl arg without verification.
The UBSAN warning calltrace like below:

UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in fs/buffer.c:1709:35
signed integer overflow:
-9223372036854775808 - 1 cannot be represented in type 'long long int'
CPU: 3 PID: 2523 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 4.19.90 #1
Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)

The reason for triggering this warning is __block_write_full_page()
-> i_size_read(inode) - 1 overflow.
inode->i_size is assigned in __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_set_size() -> bytesize.
We think it is necessary to limit the size of arg to prevent errors.

Moreover, __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_add_socket(), arg will be cast to int.
Assuming the value of arg is 0x80000000000000001) (on a 64-bit machine),
it will become 1 after the coercion, which will return unexpected results.

Fix it by adding checks to prevent passing in too large numbers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53513 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
