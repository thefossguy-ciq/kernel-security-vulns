Subject: CVE-2023-54285: iomap: Fix possible overflow condition in iomap_write_delalloc_scan

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iomap: Fix possible overflow condition in iomap_write_delalloc_scan

folio_next_index() returns an unsigned long value which left shifted
by PAGE_SHIFT could possibly cause an overflow on 32-bit system. Instead
use folio_pos(folio) + folio_size(folio), which does this correctly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
