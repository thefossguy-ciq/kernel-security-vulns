Subject: CVE-2023-52985: arm64: dts: imx8mm-verdin: Do not power down eth-phy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: imx8mm-verdin: Do not power down eth-phy

Currently if suspending using either freeze or memory state, the fec
driver tries to power down the phy which leads to crash of the kernel
and non-responsible kernel with the following call trace:

[   24.839889 ] Call trace:
[   24.839892 ]  phy_error+0x18/0x60
[   24.839898 ]  kszphy_handle_interrupt+0x6c/0x80
[   24.839903 ]  phy_interrupt+0x20/0x2c
[   24.839909 ]  irq_thread_fn+0x30/0xa0
[   24.839919 ]  irq_thread+0x178/0x2c0
[   24.839925 ]  kthread+0x154/0x160
[   24.839932 ]  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

Since there is currently no functionality in the phy subsystem to power
down phys let's just disable the feature of powering-down the ethernet
phy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52985 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0bdd5a7b517f16fdffc444be6516c45788548d08
