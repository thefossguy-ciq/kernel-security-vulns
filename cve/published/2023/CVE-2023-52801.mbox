Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Fix missing update of domains_itree after splitting iopt_area

In iopt_area_split(), if the original iopt_area has filled a domain and is
linked to domains_itree, pages_nodes have to be properly
reinserted. Otherwise the domains_itree becomes corrupted and we will UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52801 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
