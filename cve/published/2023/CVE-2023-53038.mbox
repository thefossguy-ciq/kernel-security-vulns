Subject: CVE-2023-53038: scsi: lpfc: Check kzalloc() in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Check kzalloc() in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read()

If kzalloc() fails in lpfc_sli4_cgn_params_read(), then we rely on
lpfc_read_object()'s routine to NULL check pdata.

Currently, an early return error is thrown from lpfc_read_object() to
protect us from NULL ptr dereference, but the errno code is -ENODEV.

Change the errno code to a more appropriate -ENOMEM.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53038 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
