Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: pcie: fix NULL pointer dereference in iwl_pcie_irq_rx_msix_handler()

rxq can be NULL only when trans_pcie->rxq is NULL and entry->entry
is zero. For the case when entry->entry is not equal to 0, rxq
won't be NULL even if trans_pcie->rxq is NULL. Modify checker to
check for trans_pcie->rxq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53251 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
