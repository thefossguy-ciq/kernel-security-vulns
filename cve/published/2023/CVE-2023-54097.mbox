Subject: CVE-2023-54097: regulator: stm32-pwr: fix of_iomap leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: stm32-pwr: fix of_iomap leak

Smatch reports:
drivers/regulator/stm32-pwr.c:166 stm32_pwr_regulator_probe() warn:
'base' from of_iomap() not released on lines: 151,166.

In stm32_pwr_regulator_probe(), base is not released
when devm_kzalloc() fails to allocate memory or
devm_regulator_register() fails to register a new regulator device,
which may cause a leak.

To fix this issue, replace of_iomap() with
devm_platform_ioremap_resource(). devm_platform_ioremap_resource()
is a specialized function for platform devices.
It allows 'base' to be automatically released whether the probe
function succeeds or fails.

Besides, use IS_ERR(base) instead of !base
as the return value of devm_platform_ioremap_resource()
can either be a pointer to the remapped memory or
an ERR_PTR() encoded error code if the operation fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54097 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
