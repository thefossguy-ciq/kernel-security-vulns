Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: minimal: fix potential memory leak in mlxsw_m_linecards_init

The line cards array is not freed in the error path of
mlxsw_m_linecards_init(), which can lead to a memory leak. Fix by
freeing the array in the error path, thereby making the error path
identical to mlxsw_m_linecards_fini().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53195 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
