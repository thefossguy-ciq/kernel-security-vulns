Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genirq/ipi: Fix NULL pointer deref in irq_data_get_affinity_mask()

If ipi_send_{mask|single}() is called with an invalid interrupt number, all
the local variables there will be NULL. ipi_send_verify() which is invoked
from these functions does verify its 'data' parameter, resulting in a
kernel oops in irq_data_get_affinity_mask() as the passed NULL pointer gets
dereferenced.

Add a missing NULL pointer check in ipi_send_verify()...

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static
analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53332 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
