Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kcm: Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()

syzbot reported a memory leak like below:

BUG: memory leak
unreferenced object 0xffff88810b088c00 (size 240):

In kcm_sendmsg(), kcm_tx_msg(head)->last_skb is used as a cursor to append
newly allocated skbs to 'head'. If some bytes are copied, an error occurred,
and jumped to out_error label, 'last_skb' is left unmodified. A later
kcm_sendmsg() will use an obsoleted 'last_skb' reference, corrupting the
'head' frag_list and causing the leak.

This patch fixes this issue by properly updating the last allocated skb in
'last_skb'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54112 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
