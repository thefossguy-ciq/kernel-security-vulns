Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubi: Fix UAF wear-leveling entry in eraseblk_count_seq_show()

Wear-leveling entry could be freed in error path, which may be accessed
again in eraseblk_count_seq_show(), for example:

__erase_worker                eraseblk_count_seq_show
                                wl = ubi->lookuptbl[*block_number]
				if (wl)
  wl_entry_destroy
    ubi->lookuptbl[e->pnum] = NULL
    kmem_cache_free(ubi_wl_entry_slab, e)
		                   erase_count = wl->ec  // UAF!

Wear-leveling entry updating/accessing in ubi->lookuptbl should be
protected by ubi->wl_lock, fix it by adding ubi->wl_lock to serialize
wl entry accessing between wl_entry_destroy() and
eraseblk_count_seq_show().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53826 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
