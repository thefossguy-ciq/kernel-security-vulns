Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pmic_glink_altmode: fix port sanity check

The PMIC GLINK altmode driver currently supports at most two ports.

Fix the incomplete port sanity check on notifications to avoid
accessing and corrupting memory beyond the port array if we ever get a
notification for an unsupported port.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52495 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/532a5557da6892a6b2d5793052e1bce1f4c9e177
