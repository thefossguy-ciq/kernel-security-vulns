Subject: CVE-2023-54035: netfilter: nf_tables: fix underflow in chain reference counter

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix underflow in chain reference counter

Set element addition error path decrements reference counter on chains
twice: once on element release and again via nft_data_release().

Then, d6b478666ffa ("netfilter: nf_tables: fix underflow in object
reference counter") incorrectly fixed this by removing the stateful
object reference count decrement.

Restore the stateful object decrement as in b91d90368837 ("netfilter:
nf_tables: fix leaking object reference count") and let
nft_data_release() decrement the chain reference counter, so this is
done only once.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54035 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
