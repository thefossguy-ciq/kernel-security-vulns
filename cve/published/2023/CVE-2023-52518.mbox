Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_codec: Fix leaking content of local_codecs

The following memory leak can be observed when the controller supports
codecs which are stored in local_codecs list but the elements are never
freed:

unreferenced object 0xffff88800221d840 (size 32):
  comm "kworker/u3:0", pid 36, jiffies 4294898739 (age 127.060s)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/626535077ba9dc110787540d1fe24881094c15a1
