Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mxsfb: Disable overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_disable()

When disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_update(),
overlay plane's framebuffer pointer is NULL.  So, dereferencing it would
cause a kernel Oops(NULL pointer dereferencing).  Fix the issue by
disabling overlay plane in mxsfb_plane_overlay_atomic_disable() instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8bf2d4ca521d3acb57fc1607386e749b3cc92aaf
