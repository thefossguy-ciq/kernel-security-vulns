Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix slab-out-of-bounds read in hdr_delete_de()

Here is a BUG report from syzbot:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in hdr_delete_de+0xe0/0x150 fs/ntfs3/index.c:806
Read of size 16842960 at addr ffff888079cc0600 by task syz-executor934/3631

Call Trace:
 memmove+0x25/0x60 mm/kasan/shadow.c:54
 hdr_delete_de+0xe0/0x150 fs/ntfs3/index.c:806
 indx_delete_entry+0x74f/0x3670 fs/ntfs3/index.c:2193
 ni_remove_name+0x27a/0x980 fs/ntfs3/frecord.c:2910
 ntfs_unlink_inode+0x3d4/0x720 fs/ntfs3/inode.c:1712
 ntfs_rename+0x41a/0xcb0 fs/ntfs3/namei.c:276

Before using the meta-data in struct INDEX_HDR, we need to
check index header valid or not. Otherwise, the corruptedi
(or malicious) fs image can cause out-of-bounds access which
could make kernel panic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
