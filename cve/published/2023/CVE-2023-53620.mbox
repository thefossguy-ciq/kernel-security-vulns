Subject: CVE-2023-53620: md: fix soft lockup in status_resync

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: fix soft lockup in status_resync

status_resync() will calculate 'curr_resync - recovery_active' to show
user a progress bar like following:

[============>........]  resync = 61.4%

'curr_resync' and 'recovery_active' is updated in md_do_sync(), and
status_resync() can read them concurrently, hence it's possible that
'curr_resync - recovery_active' can overflow to a huge number. In this
case status_resync() will be stuck in the loop to print a large amount
of '=', which will end up soft lockup.

Fix the problem by setting 'resync' to MD_RESYNC_ACTIVE in this case,
this way resync in progress will be reported to user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53620 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
