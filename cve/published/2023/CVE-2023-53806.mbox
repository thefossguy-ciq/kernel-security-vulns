Subject: CVE-2023-53806: drm/amd/display: populate subvp cmd info only for the top pipe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: populate subvp cmd info only for the top pipe

[Why]
System restart observed while changing the display resolution
to 8k with extended mode. Sytem restart was caused by a page fault.

[How]
When the driver populates subvp info it did it for both the pipes using
vblank which caused an outof bounds array access causing the page fault.
added checks to allow the top pipe only to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53806 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
