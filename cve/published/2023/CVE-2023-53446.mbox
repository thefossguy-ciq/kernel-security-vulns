Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM on MFD function removal to avoid use-after-free

Struct pcie_link_state->downstream is a pointer to the pci_dev of function
0.  Previously we retained that pointer when removing function 0, and
subsequent ASPM policy changes dereferenced it, resulting in a
use-after-free warning from KASAN, e.g.:

  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:03:00.0/remove
  # echo powersave > /sys/module/pcie_aspm/parameters/policy

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pcie_config_aspm_link+0x42d/0x500
  Call Trace:
   kasan_report+0xae/0xe0
   pcie_config_aspm_link+0x42d/0x500
   pcie_aspm_set_policy+0x8e/0x1a0
   param_attr_store+0x162/0x2c0
   module_attr_store+0x3e/0x80

PCIe spec r6.0, sec 7.5.3.7, recommends that software program the same ASPM
Control value in all functions of multi-function devices.

Disable ASPM and free the pcie_link_state when any child function is
removed so we can discard the dangling pcie_link_state->downstream pointer
and maintain the same ASPM Control configuration for all functions.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
