Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: improve error handling from ext4_dirhash()

The ext4_dirhash() will *almost* never fail, especially when the hash
tree feature was first introduced.  However, with the addition of
support of encrypted, casefolded file names, that function can most
certainly fail today.

So make sure the callers of ext4_dirhash() properly check for
failures, and reflect the errors back up to their callers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53473 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/ext4/hash.c
	fs/ext4/namei.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
