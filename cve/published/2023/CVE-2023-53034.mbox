Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in switchtec_ntb_mw_set_trans

There is a kernel API ntb_mw_clear_trans() would pass 0 to both addr and
size. This would make xlate_pos negative.

[   23.734156] switchtec switchtec0: MW 0: part 0 addr 0x0000000000000000 size 0x0000000000000000
[   23.734158] ================================================================================
[   23.734172] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/ntb/hw/mscc/ntb_hw_switchtec.c:293:7
[   23.734418] shift exponent -1 is negative

Ensuring xlate_pos is a positive or zero before BIT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53034 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
