Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix warning in trace_buffered_event_disable()

Warning happened in trace_buffered_event_disable() at
  WARN_ON_ONCE(!trace_buffered_event_ref)

  Call Trace:
   ? __warn+0xa5/0x1b0
   ? trace_buffered_event_disable+0x189/0x1b0
   __ftrace_event_enable_disable+0x19e/0x3e0
   free_probe_data+0x3b/0xa0
   unregister_ftrace_function_probe_func+0x6b8/0x800
   event_enable_func+0x2f0/0x3d0
   ftrace_process_regex.isra.0+0x12d/0x1b0
   ftrace_filter_write+0xe6/0x140
   vfs_write+0x1c9/0x6f0
   [...]

The cause of the warning is in __ftrace_event_enable_disable(),
trace_buffered_event_enable() was called once while
trace_buffered_event_disable() was called twice.
Reproduction script show as below, for analysis, see the comments:
 ```
 #!/bin/bash

 cd /sys/kernel/tracing/

 # 1. Register a 'disable_event' command, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was set;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_enable() was called first time;
 echo 'cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' > \
     set_ftrace_filter

 # 2. Enable the event registered, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called first time;
 echo 1 > events/initcall/initcall_finish/enable

 # 3. Try to call into cmdline_proc_show(), then SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was
 #    set again!!!
 cat /proc/cmdline

 # 4. Unregister the 'disable_event' command, then:
 #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared again;
 #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called second time!!!
 echo '!cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' > \
     set_ftrace_filter
 ```

To fix it, IIUC, we can change to call trace_buffered_event_enable() at
fist time soft-mode enabled, and call trace_buffered_event_disable() at
last time soft-mode disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54211 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
