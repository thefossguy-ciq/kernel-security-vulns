Subject: CVE-2023-53427: cifs: Fix warning and UAF when destroy the MR list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix warning and UAF when destroy the MR list

If the MR allocate failed, the MR recovery work not initialized
and list not cleared. Then will be warning and UAF when release
the MR:

Let's initialize the MR recovery work before MR allocate to prevent
the warning, remove the MRs from the list to prevent the UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53427 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
