Subject: CVE-2023-53561: net: wwan: iosm: fix NULL pointer dereference when removing device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: iosm: fix NULL pointer dereference when removing device

In suspend and resume cycle, the removal and rescan of device ends
up in NULL pointer dereference.

During driver initialization, if the ipc_imem_wwan_channel_init()
fails to get the valid device capabilities it returns an error and
further no resource (wwan struct) will be allocated. Now in this
situation if driver removal procedure is initiated it would result
in NULL pointer exception since unallocated wwan struct is dereferenced
inside ipc_wwan_deinit().

ipc_imem_run_state_worker() to handle the called functions return value
and to release the resource in failure case. It also reports the link
down event in failure cases. The user space application can handle this
event to do a device reset for restoring the device communication.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53561 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
