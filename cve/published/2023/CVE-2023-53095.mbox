Subject: CVE-2023-53095: drm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/ttm: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

The LRU mechanism may look up a resource in the process of being removed
from an object. The locking rules here are a bit unclear but it looks
currently like res->bo assignment is protected by the LRU lock, whereas
bo->resource is protected by the object lock, while *clearing* of
bo->resource is also protected by the LRU lock. This means that if
we check that bo->resource points to the LRU resource under the LRU
lock we should be safe.
So perform that check before deciding to swap out a bo. That avoids
dereferencing a NULL bo->resource in ttm_bo_swapout().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53095 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
