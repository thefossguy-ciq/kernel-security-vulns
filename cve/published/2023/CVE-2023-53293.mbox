Subject: CVE-2023-53293: Bluetooth: btrtl: check for NULL in btrtl_set_quirks()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btrtl: check for NULL in btrtl_set_quirks()

The btrtl_set_quirks() has accessed btrtl_dev->ic_info->lmp_subver since
b8e482d02513. However, if installing a Realtek Bluetooth controller
without the driver supported, it will hit the NULL point accessed.

Add a check for NULL to avoid the Kernel Oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53293 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
