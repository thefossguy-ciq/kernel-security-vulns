Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: raa215300: Fix resource leak in case of error

The clk_register_clkdev() allocates memory by calling vclkdev_alloc() and
this memory is not freed in the error path. Similarly, resources allocated
by clk_register_fixed_rate() are not freed in the error path.

Fix these issues by using devm_clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() and
devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev().

After this, the static variable clk is not needed. Replace it with 
local variable hw in probe() and drop calling clk_unregister_fixed_rate()
from raa215300_rtc_unregister_device().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54228 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/regulator/raa215300.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2bf2d2ac9e67184dc99275875a6452ca6e3027ff
