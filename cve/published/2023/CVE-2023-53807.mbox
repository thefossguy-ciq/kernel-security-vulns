Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: clocking-wizard: Fix Oops in clk_wzrd_register_divider()

Smatch detected this potential error pointer dereference
clk_wzrd_register_divider().  If devm_clk_hw_register() fails then
it sets "hw" to an error pointer and then dereferences it on the
next line.  Return the error directly instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53807 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
