Subject: CVE-2023-53175: PCI: hv: Fix a crash in hv_pci_restore_msi_msg() during hibernation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: hv: Fix a crash in hv_pci_restore_msi_msg() during hibernation

When a Linux VM with an assigned PCI device runs on Hyper-V, if the PCI
device driver is not loaded yet (i.e. MSI-X/MSI is not enabled on the
device yet), doing a VM hibernation triggers a panic in
hv_pci_restore_msi_msg() -> msi_lock_descs(&pdev->dev), because
pdev->dev.msi.data is still NULL.

Avoid the panic by checking if MSI-X/MSI is enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53175 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
