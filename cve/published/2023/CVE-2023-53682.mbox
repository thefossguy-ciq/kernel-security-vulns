Subject: CVE-2023-53682: hwmon: (xgene) Fix ioremap and memremap leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (xgene) Fix ioremap and memremap leak

Smatch reports:

drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c:757 xgene_hwmon_probe() warn:
'ctx->pcc_comm_addr' from ioremap() not released on line: 757.

This is because in drivers/hwmon/xgene-hwmon.c:701 xgene_hwmon_probe(),
ioremap and memremap is not released, which may cause a leak.

To fix this, ioremap and memremap is modified to devm_ioremap and
devm_memremap.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
