Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: of: fix double-free on unregistration

Since commit 3d439b1a2ad3 ("thermal/core: Alloc-copy-free the thermal
zone parameters structure"), thermal_zone_device_register() allocates
a copy of the tzp argument and frees it when unregistering, so
thermal_of_zone_register() now ends up leaking its original tzp and
double-freeing the tzp copy. Fix this by locating tzp on stack instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/adce49089412a9ae28f5c666e0bb12fbcd86b3f7
