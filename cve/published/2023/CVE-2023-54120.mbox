Subject: CVE-2023-54120: Bluetooth: Fix race condition in hidp_session_thread

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix race condition in hidp_session_thread

There is a potential race condition in hidp_session_thread that may
lead to use-after-free. For instance, the timer is active while
hidp_del_timer is called in hidp_session_thread(). After hidp_session_put,
then 'session' will be freed, causing kernel panic when hidp_idle_timeout
is running.

The solution is to use del_timer_sync instead of del_timer.

Here is the call trace:

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54120 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
