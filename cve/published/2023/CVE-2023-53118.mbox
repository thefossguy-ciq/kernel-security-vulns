Subject: CVE-2023-53118: scsi: core: Fix a procfs host directory removal regression

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix a procfs host directory removal regression

scsi_proc_hostdir_rm() decreases a reference counter and hence must only be
called once per host that is removed. This change does not require a
scsi_add_host_with_dma() change since scsi_add_host_with_dma() will return
0 (success) if scsi_proc_host_add() is called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53118 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
