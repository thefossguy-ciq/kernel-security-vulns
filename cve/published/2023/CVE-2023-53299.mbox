Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: fix leak of 'r10bio->remaining' for recovery

raid10_sync_request() will add 'r10bio->remaining' for both rdev and
replacement rdev. However, if the read io fails, recovery_request_write()
returns without issuing the write io, in this case, end_sync_request()
is only called once and 'remaining' is leaked, cause an io hang.

Fix the problem by decreasing 'remaining' according to if 'bio' and
'repl_bio' is valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53299 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
