Subject: CVE-2023-54034: iommufd: Make sure to zero vfio_iommu_type1_info before copying to user

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Make sure to zero vfio_iommu_type1_info before copying to user

Missed a zero initialization here. Most of the struct is filled with
a copy_from_user(), however minsz for that copy is smaller than the
actual struct by 8 bytes, thus we don't fill the padding.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54034 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7adcec686e4d699c169d34c722132b2bce5232cb
