Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_ffa: Check if ffa_driver remove is present before executing

Currently ffa_drv->remove() is called unconditionally from
ffa_device_remove(). Since the driver registration doesn't check for it
and allows it to be registered without .remove callback, we need to check
for the presence of it before executing it from ffa_device_remove() to
above a NULL pointer dereference like the one below:

  | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
