Subject: CVE-2023-54118: serial: sc16is7xx: setup GPIO controller later in probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: sc16is7xx: setup GPIO controller later in probe

The GPIO controller component of the sc16is7xx driver is setup too
early, which can result in a race condition where another device tries
to utilise the GPIO lines before the sc16is7xx device has finished
initialising.

This issue manifests itself as an Oops when the GPIO lines are configured:

    Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address
    ...
    pc : sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x68/0x108 [sc16is7xx]
    lr : sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x4c/0x108 [sc16is7xx]
    ...

This patch moves the setup of the GPIO controller functions to later in the
probe function, ensuring the sc16is7xx device has already finished
initialising by the time other devices try to make use of the GPIO lines.
The error handling has also been reordered to reflect the new
initialisation order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54118 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
