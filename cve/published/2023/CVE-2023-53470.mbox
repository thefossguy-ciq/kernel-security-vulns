Subject: CVE-2023-53470: ionic: catch failure from devlink_alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ionic: catch failure from devlink_alloc

Add a check for NULL on the alloc return.  If devlink_alloc() fails and
we try to use devlink_priv() on the NULL return, the kernel gets very
unhappy and panics. With this fix, the driver load will still fail,
but at least it won't panic the kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53470 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
