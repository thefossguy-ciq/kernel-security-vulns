Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: cancel queued works in probe error path

If it fails to get the devices's MAC address, octep_probe exits while
leaving the delayed work intr_poll_task queued. When the work later
runs, it's a use after free.

Move the cancelation of intr_poll_task from octep_remove into
octep_device_cleanup. This does not change anything in the octep_remove
flow, but octep_device_cleanup is called also in the octep_probe error
path, where the cancelation is needed.

Note that the cancelation of ctrl_mbox_task has to follow
intr_poll_task's, because the ctrl_mbox_task may be queued by
intr_poll_task.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53638 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/62312e2f6466b5f0a120542a38b410d88a34ed00
