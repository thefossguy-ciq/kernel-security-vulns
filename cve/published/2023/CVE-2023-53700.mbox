Subject: CVE-2023-53700: media: max9286: Fix memleak in max9286_v4l2_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: max9286: Fix memleak in max9286_v4l2_register()

There is a kmemleak when testing the media/i2c/max9286.c with bpf mock
device:

kmemleak: 5 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)

unreferenced object 0xffff88810defc400 (size 256):

max9286_v4l2_register() calls v4l2_ctrl_new_std(), but won't free the
created v412_ctrl when fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() failed, which
causes the memleak. Call v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() to free the v412_ctrl.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53700 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
