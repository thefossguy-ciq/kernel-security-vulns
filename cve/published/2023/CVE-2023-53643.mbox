Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-tcp: don't access released socket during error recovery

While the error recovery work is temporarily failing reconnect attempts,
running the 'nvme list' command causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference
by calling getsockname() with a released socket.

During error recovery work, the nvme tcp socket is released and a new one
created, so it is not safe to access the socket without proper check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53643 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
