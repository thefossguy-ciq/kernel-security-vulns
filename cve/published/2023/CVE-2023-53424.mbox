Subject: CVE-2023-53424: clk: mediatek: fix of_iomap memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: mediatek: fix of_iomap memory leak

Smatch reports:
drivers/clk/mediatek/clk-mtk.c:583 mtk_clk_simple_probe() warn:
    'base' from of_iomap() not released on lines: 496.

This problem was also found in linux-next. In mtk_clk_simple_probe(),
base is not released when handling errors
if clk_data is not existed, which may cause a leak.
So free_base should be added here to release base.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53424 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
