JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap is not setting to NULL after free in diUnmount.
If jfs_remount() free JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap but then failed at diMount().
JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap will be freed once again.
Fix this problem by setting JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap to NULL after free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53616 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
