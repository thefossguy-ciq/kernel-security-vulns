Subject: CVE-2023-53298: nfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fix memory leak of se_io context in nfc_genl_se_io

The callback context for sending/receiving APDUs to/from the selected
secure element is allocated inside nfc_genl_se_io and supposed to be
eventually freed in se_io_cb callback function. However, there are several
error paths where the bwi_timer is not charged to call se_io_cb later, and
the cb_context is leaked.

The patch proposes to free the cb_context explicitly on those error paths.

At the moment we can't simply check 'dev->ops->se_io()' return value as it
may be negative in both cases: when the timer was charged and was not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53298 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
