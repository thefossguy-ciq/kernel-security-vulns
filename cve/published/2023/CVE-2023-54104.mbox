Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: rawnand: fsl_upm: Fix an off-by one test in fun_exec_op()

'op-cs' is copied in 'fun->mchip_number' which is used to access the
'mchip_offsets' and the 'rnb_gpio' arrays.
These arrays have NAND_MAX_CHIPS elements, so the index must be below this
limit.

Fix the sanity check in order to avoid the NAND_MAX_CHIPS value. This
would lead to out-of-bound accesses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54104 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
