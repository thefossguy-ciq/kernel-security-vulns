Subject: CVE-2023-53867: ceph: fix potential use-after-free bug when trimming caps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix potential use-after-free bug when trimming caps

When trimming the caps and just after the 'session->s_cap_lock' is
released in ceph_iterate_session_caps() the cap maybe removed by
another thread, and when using the stale cap memory in the callbacks
it will trigger use-after-free crash.

We need to check the existence of the cap just after the 'ci->i_ceph_lock'
being acquired. And do nothing if it's already removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53867 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
