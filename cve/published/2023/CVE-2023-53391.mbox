Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

shmem: use ramfs_kill_sb() for kill_sb method of ramfs-based tmpfs

As the ramfs-based tmpfs uses ramfs_init_fs_context() for the
init_fs_context method, which allocates fc->s_fs_info, use ramfs_kill_sb()
to free it and avoid a memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53391 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
