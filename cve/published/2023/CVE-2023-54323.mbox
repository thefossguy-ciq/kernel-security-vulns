Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/pmem: Fix nvdimm registration races

A loop of the form:

    while true; do modprobe cxl_pci; modprobe -r cxl_pci; done

...fails with the following crash signature:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000040
    [..]
    RIP: 0010:cxl_internal_send_cmd+0x5/0xb0 [cxl_core]
    [..]
    Call Trace:
     <TASK>

     async_run_entry_fn+0x30/0x130

...namely that the bottom half of async nvdimm device registration runs
after the CXL has already torn down the context that cxl_pmem_ctl()
needs. Unlike the ACPI NFIT case that benefits from launching multiple
nvdimm device registrations in parallel from those listed in the table,
CXL is already marked PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS. So provide for a
synchronous registration path to preclude this scenario.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54323 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
