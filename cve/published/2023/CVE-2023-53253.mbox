Subject: CVE-2023-53253: HID: nvidia-shield: Reference hid_device devm allocation of input_dev name

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: nvidia-shield: Reference hid_device devm allocation of input_dev name

Use hid_device for devm allocation of the input_dev name to avoid a
use-after-free. input_unregister_device would trigger devres cleanup of all
resources associated with the input_dev, free-ing the name. The name would
subsequently be used in a uevent fired at the end of unregistering the
input_dev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53253 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b85d3807e5ec368bfd5b20245347d7c1434aff76
