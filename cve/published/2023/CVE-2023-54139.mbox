Subject: CVE-2023-54139: tracing/user_events: Ensure write index cannot be negative

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/user_events: Ensure write index cannot be negative

The write index indicates which event the data is for and accesses a
per-file array. The index is passed by user processes during write()
calls as the first 4 bytes. Ensure that it cannot be negative by
returning -EINVAL to prevent out of bounds accesses.

Update ftrace self-test to ensure this occurs properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54139 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
