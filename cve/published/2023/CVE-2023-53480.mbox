Subject: CVE-2023-53480: kobject: Add sanity check for kset->kobj.ktype in kset_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kobject: Add sanity check for kset->kobj.ktype in kset_register()

When I register a kset in the following way:
	static struct kset my_kset;
	kobject_set_name(&my_kset.kobj, "my_kset");
        ret = kset_register(&my_kset);

A null pointer dereference exception is occurred:
[ 4453.568337] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at \
virtual address 0000000000000028
... ...
[ 4453.810361] Call trace:
[ 4453.813062]  kobject_get_ownership+0xc/0x34
[ 4453.817493]  kobject_add_internal+0x98/0x274
[ 4453.822005]  kset_register+0x5c/0xb4
[ 4453.825820]  my_kobj_init+0x44/0x1000 [my_kset]
... ...

Because I didn't initialize my_kset.kobj.ktype.

According to the description in Documentation/core-api/kobject.rst:
 - A ktype is the type of object that embeds a kobject.  Every structure
   that embeds a kobject needs a corresponding ktype.

So add sanity check to make sure kset->kobj.ktype is not NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53480 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
