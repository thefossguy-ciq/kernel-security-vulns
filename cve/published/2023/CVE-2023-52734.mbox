Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: sch: Bounds check priority

Nothing was explicitly bounds checking the priority index used to access
clpriop[]. WARN and bail out early if it's pathological. Seen with GCC 13:

../net/sched/sch_htb.c: In function 'htb_activate_prios':
../net/sched/sch_htb.c:437:44: warning: array subscript [0, 31] is outside array bounds of 'struct htb_prio[8]' [-Warray-bounds=]
  437 |                         if (p->inner.clprio[prio].feed.rb_node)
      |                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~
../net/sched/sch_htb.c:131:41: note: while referencing 'clprio'
  131 |                         struct htb_prio clprio[TC_HTB_NUMPRIO];
      |                                         ^~~~~~

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52734 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
