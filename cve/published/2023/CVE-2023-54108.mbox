Subject: CVE-2023-54108: scsi: qla2xxx: Fix DMA-API call trace on NVMe LS requests

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix DMA-API call trace on NVMe LS requests

The following message and call trace was seen with debug kernels:

DMA-API: qla2xxx 0000:41:00.0: device driver failed to check map
error [device address=0x00000002a3ff38d8] [size=1024 bytes] [mapped as
single]
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2930 at kernel/dma/debug.c:1017
	 check_unmap+0xf42/0x1990

Call Trace:
	debug_dma_unmap_page+0xc9/0x100
	qla_nvme_ls_unmap+0x141/0x210 [qla2xxx]

Remove DMA mapping from the driver altogether, as it is already done by FC
layer. This prevents the warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
