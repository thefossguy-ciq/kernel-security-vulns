Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: multi-gen LRU: fix crash during cgroup migration

lru_gen_migrate_mm() assumes lru_gen_add_mm() runs prior to itself.  This
isn't true for the following scenario:

    CPU 1                         CPU 2

  clone()
    cgroup_can_fork()
                                cgroup_procs_write()
    cgroup_post_fork()
                                  task_lock()
                                  lru_gen_migrate_mm()
                                  task_unlock()
    task_lock()
    lru_gen_add_mm()
    task_unlock()

And when the above happens, kernel crashes because of linked list
corruption (mm_struct->lru_gen.list).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52940 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04448022311cebd30969d3aebdde765f1258b360
