Subject: CVE-2023-53077: drm/amd/display: fix shift-out-of-bounds in CalculateVMAndRowBytes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix shift-out-of-bounds in CalculateVMAndRowBytes

[WHY]
When PTEBufferSizeInRequests is zero, UBSAN reports the following
warning because dml_log2 returns an unexpected negative value:

  shift exponent 4294966273 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

[HOW]

In the case PTEBufferSizeInRequests is zero, skip the dml_log2() and
assign the result directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53077 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
