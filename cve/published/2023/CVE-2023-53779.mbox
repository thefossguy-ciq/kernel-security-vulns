Subject: CVE-2023-53779: mfd: dln2: Fix memory leak in dln2_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: dln2: Fix memory leak in dln2_probe()

When dln2_setup_rx_urbs() in dln2_probe() fails, error out_free forgets
to call usb_put_dev() to decrease the refcount of dln2->usb_dev.

Fix this by adding usb_put_dev() in the error handling code of
dln2_probe().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53779 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
