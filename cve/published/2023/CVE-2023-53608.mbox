Subject: CVE-2023-53608: nilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix potential UAF of struct nilfs_sc_info in nilfs_segctor_thread()

The finalization of nilfs_segctor_thread() can race with
nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() which terminates that thread, potentially
causing a use-after-free BUG as KASAN detected.

At the end of nilfs_segctor_thread(), it assigns NULL to "sc_task" member
of "struct nilfs_sc_info" to indicate the thread has finished, and then
notifies nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() of this using waitqueue
"sc_wait_task" on the struct nilfs_sc_info.

However, here, immediately after the NULL assignment to "sc_task", it is
possible that nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() will detect it and return to
continue the deallocation, freeing the nilfs_sc_info structure before the
thread does the notification.

This fixes the issue by protecting the NULL assignment to "sc_task" and
its notification, with spinlock "sc_state_lock" of the struct
nilfs_sc_info.  Since nilfs_segctor_kill_thread() does a final check to
see if "sc_task" is NULL with "sc_state_lock" locked, this can eliminate
the race.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53608 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
