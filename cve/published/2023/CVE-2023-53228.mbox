Subject: CVE-2023-53228: drm/amdgpu: drop redundant sched job cleanup when cs is aborted

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: drop redundant sched job cleanup when cs is aborted

Once command submission failed due to userptr invalidation in
amdgpu_cs_submit, legacy code will perform cleanup of scheduler
job. However, it's not needed at all, as former commit has integrated
job cleanup stuff into amdgpu_job_free. Otherwise, because of double
free, a NULL pointer dereference will occur in such scenario.

Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2457

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
