The IOCB counts are out of order and that would block any commands from
going out and subsequently hang the system. Synchronize the IOCB count to
be in correct order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
