Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amba: bus: fix refcount leak

commit 5de1540b7bc4 ("drivers/amba: create devices from device tree")
increases the refcount of of_node, but not releases it in
amba_device_release, so there is refcount leak. By using of_node_put
to avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54230 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
