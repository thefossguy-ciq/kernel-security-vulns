Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: fix memory leak in hci_update_adv_data()

When hci_cmd_sync_queue() failed in hci_update_adv_data(), inst_ptr is
not freed, which will cause memory leak, convert to use ERR_PTR/PTR_ERR
to pass the instance to callback so no memory needs to be allocated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ac6043bd3e5b58d30f50737aedc2e58e8087ad5
