Subject: CVE-2023-54057: iommu/amd: Add a length limitation for the ivrs_acpihid command-line parameter

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Add a length limitation for the ivrs_acpihid command-line parameter

The 'acpiid' buffer in the parse_ivrs_acpihid function may overflow,
because the string specifier in the format string sscanf()
has no width limitation.

Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center
(linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54057 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
