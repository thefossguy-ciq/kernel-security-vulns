Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

l2tp: close all race conditions in l2tp_tunnel_register()

The code in l2tp_tunnel_register() is racy in several ways:

1. It modifies the tunnel socket _after_ publishing it.

2. It calls setup_udp_tunnel_sock() on an existing socket without
   locking.

3. It changes sock lock class on fly, which triggers many syzbot
   reports.

This patch amends all of them by moving socket initialization code
before publishing and under sock lock. As suggested by Jakub, the
l2tp lockdep class is not necessary as we can just switch to
bh_lock_sock_nested().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
