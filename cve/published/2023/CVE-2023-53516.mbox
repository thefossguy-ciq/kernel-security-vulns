Subject: CVE-2023-53516: macvlan: add forgotten nla_policy for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

macvlan: add forgotten nla_policy for IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF

The previous commit 954d1fa1ac93 ("macvlan: Add netlink attribute for
broadcast cutoff") added one additional attribute named
IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF to allow broadcast cutfoff.

However, it forgot to describe the nla_policy at macvlan_policy
(drivers/net/macvlan.c). Hence, this suppose NLA_S32 (4 bytes) integer
can be faked as empty (0 bytes) by a malicious user, which could leads
to OOB in heap just like CVE-2023-3773.

To fix it, this commit just completes the nla_policy description for
IFLA_MACVLAN_BC_CUTOFF. This enforces the length check and avoids the
potential OOB read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53516 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/79f44709aa7a744fbfbadd4aef678443290c6991
