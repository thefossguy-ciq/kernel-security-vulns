Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qedf: Fix NULL dereference in error handling

Smatch reported:

drivers/scsi/qedf/qedf_main.c:3056 qedf_alloc_global_queues()
warn: missing unwind goto?

At this point in the function, nothing has been allocated so we can return
directly. In particular the "qedf->global_queues" have not been allocated
so calling qedf_free_global_queues() will lead to a NULL dereference when
we check if (!gl[i]) and "gl" is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54289 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
