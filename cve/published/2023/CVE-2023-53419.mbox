Subject: CVE-2023-53419: rcu: Protect rcu_print_task_exp_stall() ->exp_tasks access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Protect rcu_print_task_exp_stall() ->exp_tasks access

For kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y, the following scenario can
result in a NULL-pointer dereference:

           CPU1                                           CPU2
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_irqrestore                rcu_print_task_exp_stall
  if (special.b.blocked)                            READ_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks) != NULL
    raw_spin_lock_rcu_node
    np = rcu_next_node_entry(t, rnp)
    if (&t->rcu_node_entry == rnp->exp_tasks)
      WRITE_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks, np)
      ....
      raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore_rcu_node
                                                    raw_spin_lock_irqsave_rcu_node
                                                    t = list_entry(rnp->exp_tasks->prev,
                                                        struct task_struct, rcu_node_entry)
                                                    (if rnp->exp_tasks is NULL, this
                                                       will dereference a NULL pointer)

The problem is that CPU2 accesses the rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks
field without holding the rcu_node structure's ->lock and CPU2 did
not observe CPU1's change to rcu_node structure's ->exp_tasks in time.
Therefore, if CPU1 sets rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks pointer to NULL,
then CPU2 might dereference that NULL pointer.

This commit therefore holds the rcu_node structure's ->lock while
accessing that structure's->exp_tasks field.

[ paulmck: Apply Frederic Weisbecker feedback. ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53419 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
