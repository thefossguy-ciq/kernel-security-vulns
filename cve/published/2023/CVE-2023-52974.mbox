Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix UAF during login when accessing the shost ipaddress

If during iscsi_sw_tcp_session_create() iscsi_tcp_r2tpool_alloc() fails,
userspace could be accessing the host's ipaddress attr. If we then free the
session via iscsi_session_teardown() while userspace is still accessing the
session we will hit a use after free bug.

Set the tcp_sw_host->session after we have completed session creation and
can no longer fail.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52974 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
