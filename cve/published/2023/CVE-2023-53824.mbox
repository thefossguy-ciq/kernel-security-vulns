Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: annotate lockless accesses to nlk->max_recvmsg_len

syzbot reported a data-race in data-race in netlink_recvmsg() [1]

Indeed, netlink_recvmsg() can be run concurrently,
and netlink_dump() also needs protection.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
