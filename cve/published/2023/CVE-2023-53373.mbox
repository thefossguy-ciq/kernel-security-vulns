Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: seqiv - Handle EBUSY correctly

As it is seqiv only handles the special return value of EINPROGERSS,
which means that in all other cases it will free data related to the
request.

However, as the caller of seqiv may specify MAY_BACKLOG, we also need
to expect EBUSY and treat it in the same way.  Otherwise backlogged
requests will trigger a use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53373 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
