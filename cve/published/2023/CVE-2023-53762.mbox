Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF in hci_disconnect_all_sync

Use-after-free can occur in hci_disconnect_all_sync if a connection is
deleted by concurrent processing of a controller event.

To prevent this the code now tries to iterate over the list backwards
to ensure the links are cleanup before its parents, also it no longer
relies on a cursor, instead it always uses the last element since
hci_abort_conn_sync is guaranteed to call hci_conn_del.

UAF crash log:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a30c074f0b5b7f909a15c978fbc96a29e2f94e42
