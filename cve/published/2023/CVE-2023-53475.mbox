Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: tegra: fix sleep in atomic call

When we set the dual-role port to Host mode, we observed the following
splat:
[  167.057718] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at

The function tegra_xusb_padctl_get_usb3_companion eventually calls
tegra_xusb_find_port and this in turn calls kasprintf which might sleep
and so cannot be called from an atomic context.

Fix this by moving the call to tegra_xusb_padctl_get_usb3_companion to
the tegra_xhci_id_work function where it is really needed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53475 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
