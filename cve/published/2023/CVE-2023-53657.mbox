Subject: CVE-2023-53657: ice: Don't tx before switchdev is fully configured

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Don't tx before switchdev is fully configured

There is possibility that ice_eswitch_port_start_xmit might be
called while some resources are still not allocated which might
cause NULL pointer dereference. Fix this by checking if switchdev
configuration was finished.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
