Subject: CVE-2023-54203: ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in init_smb2_rsp_hdr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in init_smb2_rsp_hdr

When smb1 mount fails, KASAN detect slab-out-of-bounds in
init_smb2_rsp_hdr like the following one.
For smb1 negotiate(56bytes) , init_smb2_rsp_hdr() for smb2 is called.
The issue occurs while handling smb1 negotiate as smb2 server operations.
Add smb server operations for smb1 (get_cmd_val, init_rsp_hdr,
allocate_rsp_buf, check_user_session) to handle smb1 negotiate so that
smb2 server operation does not handle it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
