Subject: CVE-2023-53458: media: cx23885: Fix a null-ptr-deref bug in buffer_prepare() and buffer_finish()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cx23885: Fix a null-ptr-deref bug in buffer_prepare() and buffer_finish()

When the driver calls cx23885_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
function call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer
risc->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
deref is triggered.

This bug is similar to the following one:
https://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.

We believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.
Similarly, we fix this by checking the return value of cx23885_risc_buffer()
and the value of risc->cpu before buffer free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53458 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
