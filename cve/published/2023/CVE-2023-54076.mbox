Subject: CVE-2023-54076: smb: client: fix missed ses refcounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix missed ses refcounting

Use new cifs_smb_ses_inc_refcount() helper to get an active reference
of @ses and @ses->dfs_root_ses (if set).  This will prevent
@ses->dfs_root_ses of being put in the next call to cifs_put_smb_ses()
and thus potentially causing an use-after-free bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54076 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb382196e6f6e05cfafdab797840e5a96c6e7bf0
