Subject: CVE-2023-53149: ext4: avoid deadlock in fs reclaim with page writeback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: avoid deadlock in fs reclaim with page writeback

Ext4 has a filesystem wide lock protecting ext4_writepages() calls to
avoid races with switching of journalled data flag or inode format. This
lock can however cause a deadlock like:

CPU0                            CPU1

ext4_writepages()
  percpu_down_read(sbi->s_writepages_rwsem);
                                ext4_change_inode_journal_flag()
                                  percpu_down_write(sbi->s_writepages_rwsem);
                                    - blocks, all readers block from now on
  ext4_do_writepages()
    ext4_init_io_end()
      kmem_cache_zalloc(io_end_cachep, GFP_KERNEL)
        fs_reclaim frees dentry...
          dentry_unlink_inode()
            iput() - last ref =>
              iput_final() - inode dirty =>
                write_inode_now()...
                  ext4_writepages() tries to acquire sbi->s_writepages_rwsem
                    and blocks forever

Make sure we cannot recurse into filesystem reclaim from writeback code
to avoid the deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53149 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/ext4/ext4.h
	fs/ext4/inode.c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2ec97dc90df40c50e509809dc9a198638a7e18b6
