Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm crypt: add cond_resched() to dmcrypt_write()

The loop in dmcrypt_write may be running for unbounded amount of time,
thus we need cond_resched() in it.

This commit fixes the following warning:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
