Subject: CVE-2023-53443: mfd: arizona: Use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to prevent refcnt leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: arizona: Use pm_runtime_resume_and_get() to prevent refcnt leak

In arizona_clk32k_enable(), we should use pm_runtime_resume_and_get()
as pm_runtime_get_sync() will increase the refcnt even when it
returns an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53443 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
