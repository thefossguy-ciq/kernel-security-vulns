Subject: CVE-2023-53308: net: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()

In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as
pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an
error early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the
error value and continues removing the device. This results in a
resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a
callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already
gone which probably results in a crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53308 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
