Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()

Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.

  Task A            | Task B
  ------------------+------------------
  mmget_not_zero()  |
                    |  do_exit()
                    |    exit_mm()
                    |      mmput()
  mmput()           |
    exit_mmap()     |
      remove_vma()  |
        fput()      |

In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
from Task B that never comes (it's dead).

This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
death notifications will also be delayed until then.

In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52609 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
