Subject: CVE-2023-52976: efi: fix potential NULL deref in efi_mem_reserve_persistent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: fix potential NULL deref in efi_mem_reserve_persistent

When iterating on a linked list, a result of memremap is dereferenced
without checking it for NULL.

This patch adds a check that falls back on allocating a new page in
case memremap doesn't succeed.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

[ardb: return -ENOMEM instead of breaking out of the loop]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52976 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
