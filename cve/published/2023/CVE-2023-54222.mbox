Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hte: tegra-194: Fix off by one in tegra_hte_map_to_line_id()

The "map_sz" is the number of elements in the "m" array so the >
comparison needs to be changed to >= to prevent an out of bounds
read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
