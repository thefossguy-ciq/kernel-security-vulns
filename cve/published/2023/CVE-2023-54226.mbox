Subject: CVE-2023-54226: af_unix: Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Fix data races around sk->sk_shutdown.

KCSAN found a data race around sk->sk_shutdown where unix_release_sock()
and unix_shutdown() update it under unix_state_lock(), OTOH unix_poll()
and unix_dgram_poll() read it locklessly.

We need to annotate the writes and reads with WRITE_ONCE() and READ_ONCE().

BUG: KCSAN: data-race in unix_poll / unix_release_sock

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
