Subject: CVE-2023-53361: LoongArch: mm: Add p?d_leaf() definitions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: mm: Add p?d_leaf() definitions

When I do LTP test, LTP test case ksm06 caused panic at
	break_ksm_pmd_entry
	  -> pmd_leaf (Huge page table but False)
	  -> pte_present (panic)

The reason is pmd_leaf() is not defined, So like commit 501b81046701
("mips: mm: add p?d_leaf() definitions") add p?d_leaf() definition for
LoongArch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53361 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
