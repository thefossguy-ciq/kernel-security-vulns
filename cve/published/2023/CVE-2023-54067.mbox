Subject: CVE-2023-54067: btrfs: fix race when deleting free space root from the dirty cow roots list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix race when deleting free space root from the dirty cow roots list

When deleting the free space tree we are deleting the free space root
from the list fs_info->dirty_cowonly_roots without taking the lock that
protects it, which is struct btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock.
This unsynchronized list manipulation may cause chaos if there's another
concurrent manipulation of this list, such as when adding a root to it
with ctree.c:add_root_to_dirty_list().

This can result in all sorts of weird failures caused by a race, such as
the following crash:

So fix this by locking struct btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock before deleting
the free space root from that list.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
