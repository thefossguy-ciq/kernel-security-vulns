In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Fix memory leak in ubifs_sysfs_init()

When insmod ubifs.ko, a kmemleak reported as below:

 unreferenced object 0xffff88817fb1a780 (size 8):
   comm "insmod", pid 25265, jiffies 4295239702 (age 100.130s)

When kset_register() failed, we should call kset_put to cleanup it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53278 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
