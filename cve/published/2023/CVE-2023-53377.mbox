Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: prevent use-after-free by freeing the cfile later

In smb2_compound_op we have a possible use-after-free
which can cause hard to debug problems later on.

This was revealed during stress testing with KASAN enabled
kernel. Fixing it by moving the cfile free call to
a few lines below, after the usage.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53377 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
