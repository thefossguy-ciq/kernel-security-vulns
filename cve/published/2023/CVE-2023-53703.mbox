Subject: CVE-2023-53703: HID: amd_sfh: Fix for shift-out-of-bounds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: amd_sfh: Fix for shift-out-of-bounds

Shift operation of 'exp' and 'shift' variables exceeds the maximum number
of shift values in the u32 range leading to UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
