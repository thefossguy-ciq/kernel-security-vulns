Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: clean up in all error paths when enabling SR-IOV

After commit 50f303496d92 ("igb: Enable SR-IOV after reinit"), removing
the igb module could hang or crash (depending on the machine) when the
module has been loaded with the max_vfs parameter set to some value != 0.

In case of one test machine with a dual port 82580, this hang occurred:

The reproducer was a simple script:

  #!/bin/sh
  for i in `seq 1 5`; do
    modprobe -rv igb
    modprobe -v igb max_vfs=1
    sleep 1
    modprobe -rv igb
  done

It turned out that this could only be reproduce on 82580 (quad and
dual-port), but not on 82576, i350 and i210.  Further debugging showed
that igb_enable_sriov()'s call to pci_enable_sriov() is failing, because
dev->is_physfn is 0 on 82580.

Prior to commit 50f303496d92 ("igb: Enable SR-IOV after reinit"),
igb_enable_sriov() jumped into the "err_out" cleanup branch.  After this
commit it only returned the error code.

So the cleanup didn't take place, and the incorrect VF setup in the
igb_adapter structure fooled the igb driver into assuming that VFs have
been set up where no VF actually existed.

Fix this problem by cleaning up again if pci_enable_sriov() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54070 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e3ea7e82a06014b9baf1b84ba579c38cbff3558
