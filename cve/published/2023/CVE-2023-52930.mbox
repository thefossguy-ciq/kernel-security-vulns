Subject: CVE-2023-52930: drm/i915: Fix potential bit_17 double-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix potential bit_17 double-free

A userspace with multiple threads racing I915_GEM_SET_TILING to set the
tiling to I915_TILING_NONE could trigger a double free of the bit_17
bitmask.  (Or conversely leak memory on the transition to tiled.)  Move
allocation/free'ing of the bitmask within the section protected by the
obj lock.

[tursulin: Correct fixes tag and added cc stable.]
(cherry picked from commit 10e0cbaaf1104f449d695c80bcacf930dcd3c42e)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
