Subject: CVE-2023-53728: posix-timers: Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-timers: Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid

posix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix timer ID by starting from the
cached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.

This is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by
one. The loop has to terminate when the search wrapped around to the
starting point.

But that's racy vs. establishing the starting point. That is read out
lockless, which leads to the following problem:

CPU0	  	      	     	   CPU1
posix_timer_add()
  start = sig->posix_timer_id;
  lock(hash_lock);
  ...				   posix_timer_add()
  if (++sig->posix_timer_id < 0)
      			             start = sig->posix_timer_id;
     sig->posix_timer_id = 0;

So CPU1 can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break
never happens because the condition can never be true:

  if (sig->posix_timer_id == start)
     break;

While this is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is
huge (INT_MAX), the racy read of the start value caught the attention of
KCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that incorrectness.

Rewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53728 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
