Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete

Once all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed, filesystems can call
blk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn't call
blk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens
after upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has
completed.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()
can see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.

This makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the
'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&slot->slot_refs) != 0)' and return without
doing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in
blk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This is a very rare bug and has only
been seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)

There are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before
bio_endio() is called on the request's last bio, or make
__blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let's go with the first
solution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via
WARN_ON_ONCE) where a key is evicted while still in-use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53810 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
