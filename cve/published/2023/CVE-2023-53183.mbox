Subject: CVE-2023-53183: btrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: exit gracefully if reloc roots don't match

[BUG]
Syzbot reported a crash that an ASSERT() got triggered inside
prepare_to_merge().

[CAUSE]
The root cause of the triggered ASSERT() is we can have a race between
quota tree creation and relocation.

This leads us to create a duplicated quota tree in the
btrfs_read_fs_root() path, and since it's treated as fs tree, it would
have ROOT_SHAREABLE flag, causing us to create a reloc tree for it.

The bug itself is fixed by a dedicated patch for it, but this already
taught us the ASSERT() is not something straightforward for
developers.

[ENHANCEMENT]
Instead of using an ASSERT(), let's handle it gracefully and output
extra info about the mismatch reloc roots to help debug.

Also with the above ASSERT() removed, we can trigger ASSERT(0)s inside
merge_reloc_roots() later.
Also replace those ASSERT(0)s with WARN_ON()s.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53183 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
