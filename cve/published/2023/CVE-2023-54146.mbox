Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/kexec: Fix double-free of elf header buffer

After

  b3e34a47f989 ("x86/kexec: fix memory leak of elf header buffer"),

freeing image->elf_headers in the error path of crash_load_segments()
is not needed because kimage_file_post_load_cleanup() will take
care of that later. And not clearing it could result in a double-free.

Drop the superfluous vfree() call at the error path of
crash_load_segments().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54146 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
