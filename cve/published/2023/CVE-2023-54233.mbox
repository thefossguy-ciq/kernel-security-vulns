Subject: CVE-2023-54233: ASoC: SOF: avoid a NULL dereference with unsupported widgets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: avoid a NULL dereference with unsupported widgets

If an IPC4 topology contains an unsupported widget, its .module_info
field won't be set, then sof_ipc4_route_setup() will cause a kernel
Oops trying to dereference it. Add a check for such cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54233 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/170818974e9732506195c6302743856cc8bdfd6f
