Subject: CVE-2023-54150: drm/amd: Fix an out of bounds error in BIOS parser

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd: Fix an out of bounds error in BIOS parser

The array is hardcoded to 8 in atomfirmware.h, but firmware provides
a bigger one sometimes. Deferencing the larger array causes an out
of bounds error.

commit 4fc1ba4aa589 ("drm/amd/display: fix array index out of bound error
in bios parser") fixed some of this, but there are two other cases
not covered by it.  Fix those as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54150 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
