Subject: CVE-2023-53193: drm/amdgpu: fix amdgpu_irq_put call trace in gmc_v10_0_hw_fini

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix amdgpu_irq_put call trace in gmc_v10_0_hw_fini

The gmc.ecc_irq is enabled by firmware per IFWI setting,
and the host driver is not privileged to enable/disable
the interrupt. So, it is meaningless to use the amdgpu_irq_put
function in gmc_v10_0_hw_fini, which also leads to the call
trace.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
