Subject: CVE-2023-54072: ALSA: pcm: Fix potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Fix potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers

The PCM memory allocation helpers have a sanity check against too many
buffer allocations.  However, the check is performed without a proper
lock and the allocation isn't serialized; this allows user to allocate
more memories than predefined max size.

Practically seen, this isn't really a big problem, as it's more or
less some "soft limit" as a sanity check, and it's not possible to
allocate unlimitedly.  But it's still better to address this for more
consistent behavior.

The patch covers the size check in do_alloc_pages() with the
card->memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there for
preventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails,
the size is decreased accordingly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54072 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
