Subject: CVE-2023-53124: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()

Port is allocated by sas_port_alloc_num() and rphy is allocated by either
sas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc(), all of which may return
NULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.

If sas_rphy_add() returned with failure, rphy is set to NULL. We would
access the rphy in the following lines which would also result NULL pointer
access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53124 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
