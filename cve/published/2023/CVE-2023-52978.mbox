Subject: CVE-2023-52978: riscv: kprobe: Fixup kernel panic when probing an illegal position

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: kprobe: Fixup kernel panic when probing an illegal position

The kernel would panic when probed for an illegal position. eg:

(CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_C=n)

echo 'p:hello kernel_clone+0x16 a0=%a0' >> kprobe_events
echo 1 > events/kprobes/hello/enable
cat trace

Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack
is corrupted in: __do_sys_newfstatat+0xb8/0xb8
CPU: 0 PID: 111 Comm: sh Not tainted

---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector:

That is because the kprobe's ebreak instruction broke the kernel's
original code. The user should guarantee the correction of the probe
position, but it couldn't make the kernel panic.

This patch adds arch_check_kprobe in arch_prepare_kprobe to prevent an
illegal position (Such as the middle of an instruction).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04a73558209554da17f46490ec4faaaf1b2bab68
