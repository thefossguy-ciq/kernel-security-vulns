Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: fix potential memory leak in mlx5e_init_rep_rx

The memory pointed to by the priv->rx_res pointer is not freed in the error
path of mlx5e_init_rep_rx, which can lead to a memory leak. Fix by freeing
the memory in the error path, thereby making the error path identical to
mlx5e_cleanup_rep_rx().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
