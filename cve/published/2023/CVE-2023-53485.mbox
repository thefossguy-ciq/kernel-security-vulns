The bug occurs when the dbAllocDmapLev()function attempts to access
dp->tree.stree[leafidx + LEAFIND] while the leafidx value is negative.

To rectify this, the patch introduces a safeguard within the
dbAllocDmapLev() function. A check has been added to verify if leafidx is
negative. If it is, the function immediately returns an I/O error, preventing
any further execution that could potentially cause harm.

Tested via syzbot.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53485 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
