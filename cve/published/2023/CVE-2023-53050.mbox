Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Fix memory leak in margining

Memory for the usb4->margining needs to be relased for the upstream port
of the router as well, even though the debugfs directory gets released
with the router device removal. Fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f390095bbd131ec2dfb29792d9f6fd0f0656bfc0
