Subject: CVE-2023-53434: remoteproc: imx_dsp_rproc: Add custom memory copy implementation for i.MX DSP Cores

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: imx_dsp_rproc: Add custom memory copy implementation for i.MX DSP Cores

The IRAM is part of the HiFi DSP.
According to hardware specification only 32-bits write are allowed
otherwise we get a Kernel panic.

Therefore add a custom memory copy and memset functions to deal with
the above restriction.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53434 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.30 with commit 44361033a8806aabd0f49b24e5a2fc07232cc5ff

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
