Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: imx_dsp_rproc: Add custom memory copy implementation for i.MX DSP Cores

The IRAM is part of the HiFi DSP.
According to hardware specification only 32-bits write are allowed
otherwise we get a Kernel panic.

Therefore add a custom memory copy and memset functions to deal with
the above restriction.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53434 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.30 with commit 44361033a8806aabd0f49b24e5a2fc07232cc5ff
	Fixed in 6.3.4 with commit 331cd77f3d02c35f98b48d1aa934c54c4e7102c8
	Fixed in 6.4 with commit 408ec1ff0caa340c57eecf4cbd14ef0132036a50

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53434
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/remoteproc/imx_dsp_rproc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/44361033a8806aabd0f49b24e5a2fc07232cc5ff
