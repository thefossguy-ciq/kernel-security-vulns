Subject: CVE-2023-53238: phy: hisilicon: Fix an out of bounds check in hisi_inno_phy_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: hisilicon: Fix an out of bounds check in hisi_inno_phy_probe()

The size of array 'priv->ports[]' is INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM.

In the for loop, 'i' is used as the index for array 'priv->ports[]'
with a check (i > INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM) which indicates that
INNO_PHY_PORT_NUM is allowed value for 'i' in the same loop.

This > comparison needs to be changed to >=, otherwise it potentially leads
to an out of bounds write on the next iteration through the loop

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53238 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
