Subject: CVE-2023-53273: Drivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: vmbus: Check for channel allocation before looking up relids

relid2channel() assumes vmbus channel array to be allocated when called.
However, in cases such as kdump/kexec, not all relids will be reset by the host.
When the second kernel boots and if the guest receives a vmbus interrupt during
vmbus driver initialization before vmbus_connect() is called, before it finishes,
or if it fails, the vmbus interrupt service routine is called which in turn calls
relid2channel() and can cause a null pointer dereference.

Print a warning and error out in relid2channel() for a channel id that's invalid
in the second kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53273 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
