Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btsdio: fix use after free bug in btsdio_remove due to unfinished work

In btsdio_probe, &data->work was bound with btsdio_work.In
btsdio_send_frame, it was started by schedule_work.

If we call btsdio_remove with an unfinished job, there may
be a race condition and cause UAF bug on hdev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
