Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: hi846: fix usage of pm_runtime_get_if_in_use()

pm_runtime_get_if_in_use() does not only return nonzero values when
the device is in use, it can return a negative errno too.

And especially during resuming from system suspend, when runtime pm
is not yet up again, -EAGAIN is being returned, so the subsequent
pm_runtime_put() call results in a refcount underflow.

Fix system-resume by handling -EAGAIN of pm_runtime_get_if_in_use().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53177 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
