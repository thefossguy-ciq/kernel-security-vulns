Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: raspberrypi-ts - fix refcount leak in rpi_ts_probe

rpi_firmware_get() take reference, we need to release it in error paths
as well. Use devm_rpi_firmware_get() helper to handling the resources.
Also remove the existing rpi_firmware_put().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53533 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
