Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix wrong fallback logic for FDIR

When adding a FDIR filter, if ice_vc_fdir_set_irq_ctx returns failure,
the inserted fdir entry will not be removed and if ice_vc_fdir_write_fltr
returns failure, the fdir context info for irq handler will not be cleared
which may lead to inconsistent or memory leak issue. This patch refines
failure cases to resolve this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54040 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
