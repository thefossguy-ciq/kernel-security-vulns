Subject: CVE-2023-53364: regulator: da9063: better fix null deref with partial DT

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: da9063: better fix null deref with partial DT

Two versions of the original patch were sent but V1 was merged instead
of V2 due to a mistake.

So update to V2.

The advantage of V2 is that it completely avoids dereferencing the pointer,
even just to take the address, which may fix problems with some compilers.
Both versions work on my gcc 9.4 but use the safer one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53364 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
