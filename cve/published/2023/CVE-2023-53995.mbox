Subject: CVE-2023-53995: net: ipv4: fix one memleak in __inet_del_ifa()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ipv4: fix one memleak in __inet_del_ifa()

I got the below warning when do fuzzing test:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for bond0 to become free. Usage count = 2

It can be repoduced via:

ip link add bond0 type bond
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.bond0.promote_secondaries=1
ip addr add 4.117.174.103/0 scope 0x40 dev bond0
ip addr add 192.168.100.111/255.255.255.254 scope 0 dev bond0
ip addr add 0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40 secondary dev bond0
ip addr del 4.117.174.103/0 scope 0x40 dev bond0
ip link delete bond0 type bond

In this reproduction test case, an incorrect 'last_prim' is found in
__inet_del_ifa(), as a result, the secondary address(0.0.0.4/0 scope 0x40)
is lost. The memory of the secondary address is leaked and the reference of
in_device and net_device is leaked.

Fix this problem:
Look for 'last_prim' starting at location of the deleted IP and inserting
the promoted IP into the location of 'last_prim'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
