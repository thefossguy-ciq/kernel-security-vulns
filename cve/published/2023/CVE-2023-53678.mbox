Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix system suspend without fbdev being initialized

If fbdev is not initialized for some reason - in practice on platforms
without display - suspending fbdev should be skipped during system
suspend, fix this up. While at it add an assert that suspending fbdev
only happens with the display present.

This fixes the following:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
