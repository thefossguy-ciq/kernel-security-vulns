Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix ioremap issues in lpfc_sli4_pci_mem_setup()

When if_type equals zero and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)
returns false, drbl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This passes a NULL
pointer to iounmap(), which can trigger a WARN() on certain arches.

When if_type equals six and pci_resource_start(pdev, PCI_64BIT_BAR4)
returns true, drbl_regs_memmap_p may has been remapped and
ctrl_regs_memmap_p is not remapped. This is a resource leak and passes a
NULL pointer to iounmap().

To fix these issues, we need to add null checks before iounmap(), and
change some goto labels.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53754 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
