Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to uncanceled work

In mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with
mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work. Then mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run
and mtk_jpeg_enc_device_run may be called to start the
work.
If we remove the module which will call mtk_jpeg_remove
to make cleanup, there may be a unfinished work. The
possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a
typical UAF bug.

Fix it by canceling the work before cleanup in the mtk_jpeg_remove

CPU0                  CPU1

                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work
mtk_jpeg_remove     |
  v4l2_m2m_release  |
    kfree(m2m_dev); |
                    |
                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv
                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54103 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
