Subject: CVE-2023-53180: wifi: ath12k: Avoid NULL pointer access during management transmit cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Avoid NULL pointer access during management transmit cleanup

Currently 'ar' reference is not added in skb_cb.
Though this is generally not used during transmit completion
callbacks, on interface removal the remaining idr cleanup callback
uses the ar pointer from skb_cb from management txmgmt_idr. Hence fill them
during transmit call for proper usage to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53180 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
