Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dp: Free resources after unregistering them

The DP component's unbind operation walks through the submodules to
unregister and clean things up. But if the unbind happens because the DP
controller itself is being removed, all the memory for those submodules
has just been freed.

Change the order of these operations to avoid the many use-after-free
that otherwise happens in this code path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53316 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
