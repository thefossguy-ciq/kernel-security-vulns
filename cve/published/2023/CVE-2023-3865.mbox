Subject: CVE-2023-3865: ksmbd: fix out-of-bound read in smb2_write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix out-of-bound read in smb2_write

ksmbd_smb2_check_message doesn't validate hdr->NextCommand. If
->NextCommand is bigger than Offset + Length of smb2 write, It will
allow oversized smb2 write length. It will cause OOB read in smb2_write.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-3865 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
