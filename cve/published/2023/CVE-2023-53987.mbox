Subject: CVE-2023-53987: ping: Fix potentail NULL deref for /proc/net/icmp.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ping: Fix potentail NULL deref for /proc/net/icmp.

After commit dbca1596bbb0 ("ping: convert to RCU lookups, get rid
of rwlock"), we use RCU for ping sockets, but we should use spinlock
for /proc/net/icmp to avoid a potential NULL deref mentioned in
the previous patch.

Let's go back to using spinlock there.

Note we can convert ping sockets to use hlist instead of hlist_nulls
because we do not use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU for ping sockets.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53987 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
