Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup/cpuset: Fix wrong check in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()

It was found that the check to see if a partition could use up all
the cpus from the parent cpuset in update_parent_subparts_cpumask()
was incorrect. As a result, it is possible to leave parent with no
effective cpu left even if there are tasks in the parent cpuset. This
can lead to system panic as reported in [1].

Fix this probem by updating the check to fail the enabling the partition
if parent's effective_cpus is a subset of the child's cpus_allowed.

Also record the error code when an error happens in update_prstate()
and add a test case where parent partition and child have the same cpu
list and parent has task. Enabling partition in the child will fail in
this case.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/cgroup/cpuset.c
	tools/testing/selftests/cgroup/test_cpuset_prs.sh


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2ab7f2cf5ef8f0c6212a246e681d1fe358cec1f
