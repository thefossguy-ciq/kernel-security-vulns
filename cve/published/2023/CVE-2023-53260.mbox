Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ovl: fix null pointer dereference in ovl_permission()

Following process:
          P1                     P2
 path_lookupat
  link_path_walk
   inode_permission
    ovl_permission
      ovl_i_path_real(inode, &realpath)
        path->dentry = ovl_i_dentry_upper(inode)
                          drop_cache
			   __dentry_kill(ovl_dentry)
		            iput(ovl_inode)
		             ovl_destroy_inode(ovl_inode)
		              dput(oi->__upperdentry)
		               dentry_kill(upperdentry)
		                dentry_unlink_inode
				 upperdentry->d_inode = NULL
      realinode = d_inode(realpath.dentry) // return NULL
      inode_permission(realinode)
       inode->i_sb  // NULL pointer dereference
, will trigger an null pointer dereference at realinode:

Use the helper ovl_i_path_realinode() to get realinode and then do
non-nullptr checking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53260 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
