Subject: CVE-2023-53748: media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup

variable *nplanes is provided by user via system call argument. The
possible value of q_data->fmt->num_planes is 1-3, while the value
of *nplanes can be 1-8. The array access by index i can cause array
out-of-bounds.

Fix this bug by checking *nplanes against the array size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
