Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Prevent handling any completions after qp destroy

HW may generate completions that indicates QP is destroyed.
Driver should not be scheduling any more completion handlers
for this QP, after the QP is destroyed. Since CQs are active
during the QP destroy, driver may still schedule completion
handlers. This can cause a race where the destroy_cq and poll_cq
running simultaneously.

Snippet of kernel panic while doing bnxt_re driver load unload in loop.
This indicates a poll after the CQ is freed. 

[77786.481636] Call Trace:

To avoid this, complete all completion handlers before returning the
destroy QP. If free_cq is called soon after destroy_qp,  IB stack
will cancel the CQ work before invoking the destroy_cq verb and
this will prevent any race mentioned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
