Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: fix memory leak in mlx5e_ptp_open

When kvzalloc_node or kvzalloc failed in mlx5e_ptp_open, the memory
pointed by "c" or "cparams" is not freed, which can lead to a memory
leak. Fix by freeing the array in the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54169 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
