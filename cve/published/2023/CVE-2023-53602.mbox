Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix memory leak in WMI firmware stats

Memory allocated for firmware pdev, vdev and beacon statistics
are not released during rmmod.

Fix it by calling ath11k_fw_stats_free() function before hardware
unregister.

While at it, avoid calling ath11k_fw_stats_free() while processing
the firmware stats received in the WMI event because the local list
is getting spliced and reinitialised and hence there are no elements
in the list after splicing.

Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01744-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53602 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86f9330a49d1464849482298dd34d361859183eb
