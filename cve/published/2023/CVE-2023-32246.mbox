Subject: CVE-2023-32246: ksmbd: call rcu_barrier() in ksmbd_server_exit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: call rcu_barrier() in ksmbd_server_exit()

racy issue is triggered the bug by racing between closing a connection
and rmmod. In ksmbd, rcu_barrier() is not called at module unload time,
so nothing prevents ksmbd from getting unloaded while it still has RCU
callbacks pending. It leads to trigger unintended execution of kernel
code locally and use to defeat protections such as Kernel Lockdown

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-32246 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
