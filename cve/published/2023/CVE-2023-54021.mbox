Subject: CVE-2023-54021: ext4: set goal start correctly in ext4_mb_normalize_request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: set goal start correctly in ext4_mb_normalize_request

We need to set ac_g_ex to notify the goal start used in
ext4_mb_find_by_goal. Set ac_g_ex instead of ac_f_ex in
ext4_mb_normalize_request.
Besides we should assure goal start is in range [first_data_block,
blocks_count) as ext4_mb_initialize_context does.

[ Added a check to make sure size is less than ar->pright; otherwise
  we could end up passing an underflowed value of ar->pright - size to
  ext4_get_group_no_and_offset(), which will trigger a BUG_ON later on.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
