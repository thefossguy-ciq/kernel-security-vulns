Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: da9063: fix null pointer deref with partial DT config

When some of the da9063 regulators do not have corresponding DT nodes
a null pointer dereference occurs on boot because such regulators have
no init_data causing the pointers calculated in
da9063_check_xvp_constraints() to be invalid.

Do not dereference them in this case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04a025b17d83d07924e5e32508c72536ab8f42d9
