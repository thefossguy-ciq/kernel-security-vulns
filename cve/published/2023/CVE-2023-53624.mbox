Subject: CVE-2023-53624: net/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of "credit"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_fq: fix integer overflow of "credit"

if sch_fq is configured with "initial quantum" having values greater than
INT_MAX, the first assignment of "credit" does signed integer overflow to
a very negative value.
In this situation, the syzkaller script provided by Cristoph triggers the
CPU soft-lockup warning even with few sockets. It's not an infinite loop,
but "credit" wasn't probably meant to be minus 2Gb for each new flow.
Capping "initial quantum" to INT_MAX proved to fix the issue.

v2: validation of "initial quantum" is done in fq_policy, instead of open
    coding in fq_change() _ suggested by Jakub Kicinski

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53624 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b8a05e3801661a0438fcd0cdef181030d966a5a
