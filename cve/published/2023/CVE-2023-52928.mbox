Subject: CVE-2023-52928: bpf: Skip invalid kfunc call in backtrack_insn

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Skip invalid kfunc call in backtrack_insn

The verifier skips invalid kfunc call in check_kfunc_call(), which
would be captured in fixup_kfunc_call() if such insn is not eliminated
by dead code elimination. However, this can lead to the following
warning in backtrack_insn(), also see [1]:

  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  verifier backtracking bug
  WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 8646 at kernel/bpf/verifier.c:2756 backtrack_insn
  kernel/bpf/verifier.c:2756
	__mark_chain_precision kernel/bpf/verifier.c:3065
	mark_chain_precision kernel/bpf/verifier.c:3165

	do_check kernel/bpf/verifier.c:13821 [inline]
	do_check_common kernel/bpf/verifier.c:16289
  [...]

So make backtracking conservative with this by returning ENOTSUPP.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
