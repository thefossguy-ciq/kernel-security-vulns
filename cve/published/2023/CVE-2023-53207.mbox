Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fail to recover device if queue setup is interrupted

In ublk_ctrl_end_recovery(), if wait_for_completion_interruptible() is
interrupted by signal, queues aren't setup successfully yet, so we
have to fail UBLK_CMD_END_USER_RECOVERY, otherwise kernel oops can be
triggered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
