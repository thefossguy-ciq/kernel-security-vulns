Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpu: host1x: Fix memory leak of device names

The device names allocated by dev_set_name() need be freed
before module unloading, but they can not be freed because
the kobject's refcount which was set in device_initialize()
has not be decreased to 0.

As comment of device_add() says, if it fails, use only
put_device() drop the refcount, then the name will be
freed in kobejct_cleanup().

device_del() and put_device() can be replaced with
device_unregister(), so call it to unregister the added
successfully devices, and just call put_device() to the
not added device.

Add a release() function to device to avoid null release()
function WARNING in device_release(), it's empty, because
the context devices are freed together in
host1x_memory_context_list_free().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53514 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
