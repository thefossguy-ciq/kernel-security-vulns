Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/perf: hisi: Don't migrate perf to the CPU going to teardown

The driver needs to migrate the perf context if the current using CPU going
to teardown. By the time calling the cpuhp::teardown() callback the
cpu_online_mask() hasn't updated yet and still includes the CPU going to
teardown. In current driver's implementation we may migrate the context
to the teardown CPU and leads to the below calltrace:

Use function cpumask_any_but() to find one correct active cpu to fixes
this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53656 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
