Subject: CVE-2023-53381: NFSD: fix leaked reference count of nfsd4_ssc_umount_item

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix leaked reference count of nfsd4_ssc_umount_item

The reference count of nfsd4_ssc_umount_item is not decremented
on error conditions. This prevents the laundromat from unmounting
the vfsmount of the source file.

This patch decrements the reference count of nfsd4_ssc_umount_item
on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53381 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
