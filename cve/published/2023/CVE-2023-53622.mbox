Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Fix possible data races in gfs2_show_options()

Some fields such as gt_logd_secs of the struct gfs2_tune are accessed
without holding the lock gt_spin in gfs2_show_options():

  val = sdp->sd_tune.gt_logd_secs;
  if (val != 30)
    seq_printf(s, ",commit=%d", val);

And thus can cause data races when gfs2_show_options() and other functions
such as gfs2_reconfigure() are concurrently executed:

  spin_lock(&gt->gt_spin);
  gt->gt_logd_secs = newargs->ar_commit;

To fix these possible data races, the lock sdp->sd_tune.gt_spin is
acquired before accessing the fields of gfs2_tune and released after these
accesses.

Further changes by Andreas:

- Don't hold the spin lock over the seq_printf operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53622 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
