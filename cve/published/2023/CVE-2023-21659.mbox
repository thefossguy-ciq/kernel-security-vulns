Subject: CVE-2023-21659: fs: sysfs_emit_at: Remove PAGE_SIZE alignment check

Description
===========

fs: sysfs_emit_at: Remove PAGE_SIZE alignment check


[No upstream commit because this fixes a bug in a backport.]

Before upstream commit 59bb47985c1d ("mm, sl[aou]b: guarantee natural
alignment for kmalloc(power-of-two)") which went into v5.4, kmalloc did
*not* always guarantee that PAGE_SIZE allocations are PAGE_SIZE-aligned.

Upstream commit 2efc459d06f1 ("sysfs: Add sysfs_emit and sysfs_emit_at
to format sysfs output") added two WARN()s that trigger when PAGE_SIZE
allocations are not PAGE_SIZE-aligned.  This was backported to old
kernels that don't guarantee PAGE_SIZE alignment.

Commit 10ddfb495232 ("fs: sysfs_emit: Remove PAGE_SIZE alignment check")
in 4.19.y, and its equivalent in 4.14.y and 4.9.y, tried to fix this
bug.  However, only it handled sysfs_emit(), not sysfs_emit_at().

Fix it in sysfs_emit_at() too.

A reproducer is to build the kernel with the following options:

	CONFIG_SLUB=y
	CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y
	CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON=y
	CONFIG_PM=y
	CONFIG_SUSPEND=y
	CONFIG_PM_WAKELOCKS=y

Then run:

	echo foo > /sys/power/wake_lock && cat /sys/power/wake_lock

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-21659 to this issue.


Affected versions
=================

	Issue introduced in 4.19.179 with commit cb1f69d53ac8 and fixed in 4.19.279 with commit 2a8664583d4d

Please note that only supported kernel versions have fixes applied to
them.  For a full list of currently supported kernel versions, please
see https://www.kernel.org/

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-21659
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
