Subject: CVE-2023-53557: fprobe: Release rethook after the ftrace_ops is unregistered

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fprobe: Release rethook after the ftrace_ops is unregistered

While running bpf selftests it's possible to get following fault:

  general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address \
  0x6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC NOPTI
  ...
  Call Trace:

   </TASK>

In unregister_fprobe function we can't release fp->rethook while it's
possible there are some of its users still running on another cpu.

Moving rethook_free call after fp->ops is unregistered with
unregister_ftrace_function call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53557 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
