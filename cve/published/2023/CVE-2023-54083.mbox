Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: tegra: xusb: Clear the driver reference in usb-phy dev

For the dual-role port, it will assign the phy dev to usb-phy dev and
use the port dev driver as the dev driver of usb-phy.

When we try to destroy the port dev, it will destroy its dev driver
as well. But we did not remove the reference from usb-phy dev. This
might cause the use-after-free issue in KASAN.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
