Subject: CVE-2023-53266: arm64: acpi: Fix possible memory leak of ffh_ctxt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: acpi: Fix possible memory leak of ffh_ctxt

Allocated 'ffh_ctxt' memory leak is possible if the SMCCC version
and conduit checks fail and -EOPNOTSUPP is returned without freeing the
allocated memory.

Fix the same by moving the allocation after the SMCCC version and
conduit checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53266 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7521da2eb42d65f89f511b7912d3757cf3d9168a
