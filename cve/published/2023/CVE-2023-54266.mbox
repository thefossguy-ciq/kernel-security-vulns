Subject: CVE-2023-54266: media: dvb-usb: m920x: Fix a potential memory leak in m920x_i2c_xfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-usb: m920x: Fix a potential memory leak in m920x_i2c_xfer()

'read' is freed when it is known to be NULL, but not when a read error
occurs.

Revert the logic to avoid a small leak, should a m920x_read() call fail.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54266 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
