Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mt76: mt7921: fix kernel panic by accessing unallocated eeprom.data

The MT7921 driver no longer uses eeprom.data, but the relevant code has not
been removed completely since
commit 16d98b548365 ("mt76: mt7921: rely on mcu_get_nic_capability").
This could result in potential invalid memory access.

To fix the kernel panic issue in mt7921, it is necessary to avoid accessing
unallocated eeprom.data which can lead to invalid memory access.

Furthermore, it is possible to entirely eliminate the
mt7921_mcu_parse_eeprom function and solely depend on
mt7921_mcu_parse_response to divide the RxD header.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
