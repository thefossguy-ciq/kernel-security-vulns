Subject: CVE-2023-53727: net/sched: fq_pie: avoid stalls in fq_pie_timer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fq_pie: avoid stalls in fq_pie_timer()

When setting a high number of flows (limit being 65536),
fq_pie_timer() is currently using too much time as syzbot reported.

Add logic to yield the cpu every 2048 flows (less than 150 usec
on debug kernels).
It should also help by not blocking qdisc fast paths for too long.
Worst case (65536 flows) would need 31 jiffies for a complete scan.

Relevant extract from syzbot report:

rcu: INFO: rcu_preempt detected expedited stalls on CPUs/tasks: { 0-.... } 2663 jiffies s: 873 root: 0x1/.
rcu: blocking rcu_node structures (internal RCU debug):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
