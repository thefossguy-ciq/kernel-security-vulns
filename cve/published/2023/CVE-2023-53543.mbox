Subject: CVE-2023-53543: vdpa: Add max vqp attr to vdpa_nl_policy for nlattr length check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa: Add max vqp attr to vdpa_nl_policy for nlattr length check

The vdpa_nl_policy structure is used to validate the nlattr when parsing
the incoming nlmsg. It will ensure the attribute being described produces
a valid nlattr pointer in info->attrs before entering into each handler
in vdpa_nl_ops.

That is to say, the missing part in vdpa_nl_policy may lead to illegal
nlattr after parsing, which could lead to OOB read just like CVE-2023-3773.

This patch adds the missing nla_policy for vdpa max vqp attr to avoid
such bugs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53543 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
