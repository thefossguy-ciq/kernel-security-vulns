Subject: CVE-2023-53535: net: bcmgenet: Add a check for oversized packets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bcmgenet: Add a check for oversized packets

Occasionnaly we may get oversized packets from the hardware which
exceed the nomimal 2KiB buffer size we allocate SKBs with. Add an early
check which drops the packet to avoid invoking skb_over_panic() and move
on to processing the next packet.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53535 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
