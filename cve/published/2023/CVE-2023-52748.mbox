Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: avoid format-overflow warning

With gcc and W=1 option, there's a warning like this:

fs/f2fs/compress.c: In function ‘f2fs_init_page_array_cache’:
fs/f2fs/compress.c:1984:47: error: ‘%u’ directive writing between
1 and 7 bytes into a region of size between 5 and 8
[-Werror=format-overflow=]
 1984 |  sprintf(slab_name, "f2fs_page_array_entry-%u:%u", MAJOR(dev),
		MINOR(dev));
      |                                               ^~

String "f2fs_page_array_entry-%u:%u" can up to 35. The first "%u" can up
to 4 and the second "%u" can up to 7, so total size is "24 + 4 + 7 = 35".
slab_name's size should be 35 rather than 32.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
