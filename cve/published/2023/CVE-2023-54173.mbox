Subject: CVE-2023-54173: bpf: Disable preemption in bpf_event_output

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Disable preemption in bpf_event_output

We received report [1] of kernel crash, which is caused by
using nesting protection without disabled preemption.

The bpf_event_output can be called by programs executed by
bpf_prog_run_array_cg function that disabled migration but
keeps preemption enabled.

This can cause task to be preempted by another one inside the
nesting protection and lead eventually to two tasks using same
perf_sample_data buffer and cause crashes like:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000001
  #PF: supervisor instruction fetch in kernel mode
  #PF: error_code(0x0010) - not-present page

Fixing this by disabling preemption in bpf_event_output.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
