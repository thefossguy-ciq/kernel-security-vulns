Subject: CVE-2023-53388: drm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Clean dangling pointer on bind error path

mtk_drm_bind() can fail, in which case drm_dev_put() is called,
destroying the drm_device object. However a pointer to it was still
being held in the private object, and that pointer would be passed along
to DRM in mtk_drm_sys_prepare() if a suspend were triggered at that
point, resulting in a panic. Clean the pointer when destroying the
object in the error path to prevent this from happening.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53388 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
