Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: x86: s2idle: Catch multiple ACPI_TYPE_PACKAGE objects

If a badly constructed firmware includes multiple `ACPI_TYPE_PACKAGE`
objects while evaluating the AMD LPS0 _DSM, there will be a memory
leak.  Explicitly guard against this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
