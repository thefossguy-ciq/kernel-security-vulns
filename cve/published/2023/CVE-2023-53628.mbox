Subject: CVE-2023-53628: drm/amdgpu: drop gfx_v11_0_cp_ecc_error_irq_funcs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: drop gfx_v11_0_cp_ecc_error_irq_funcs

The gfx.cp_ecc_error_irq is retired in gfx11. In gfx_v11_0_hw_fini still
use amdgpu_irq_put to disable this interrupt, which caused the call trace
in this function.

v2:
- Handle umc and gfx ras cases in separated patch
- Retired the gfx_v11_0_cp_ecc_error_irq_funcs in gfx11

v3:
- Improve the subject and code comments
- Add judgment on gfx11 in the function of amdgpu_gfx_ras_late_init

v4:
- Drop the define of CP_ME1_PIPE_INST_ADDR_INTERVAL and
SET_ECC_ME_PIPE_STATE which using in gfx_v11_0_set_cp_ecc_error_state
- Check cp_ecc_error_irq.funcs rather than ip version for a more
sustainable life

v5:
- Simplify judgment conditions

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53628 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
