Subject: CVE-2023-54188: dmaengine: apple-admac: Fix 'current_tx' not getting freed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: apple-admac: Fix 'current_tx' not getting freed

In terminate_all we should queue up all submitted descriptors to be
freed. We do that for the content of the 'issued' and 'submitted' lists,
but the 'current_tx' descriptor falls through the cracks as it's
removed from the 'issued' list once it gets assigned to be the current
descriptor. Explicitly queue up freeing of the 'current_tx' descriptor
to address a memory leak that is otherwise present.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
