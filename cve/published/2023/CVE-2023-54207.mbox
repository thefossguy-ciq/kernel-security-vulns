Subject: CVE-2023-54207: HID: uclogic: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: uclogic: Correct devm device reference for hidinput input_dev name

Reference the HID device rather than the input device for the devm
allocation of the input_dev name. Referencing the input_dev would lead to a
use-after-free when the input_dev was unregistered and subsequently fires a
uevent that depends on the name. At the point of firing the uevent, the
name would be freed by devres management.

Use devm_kasprintf to simplify the logic for allocating memory and
formatting the input_dev name string.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
