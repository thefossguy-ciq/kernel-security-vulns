Subject: CVE-2023-54245: ASoC: codecs: tx-macro: Fix for KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: tx-macro: Fix for KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds

When we run syzkaller we get below Out of Bound.
    "KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in regcache_flat_read"

    Below is the backtrace of the issue:

    dump_backtrace+0x0/0x4c8
    show_stack+0x34/0x44
    dump_stack_lvl+0xd8/0x118

    tx_macro_digital_mute+0xec/0x140

    Actually There is no need to have decimator with 32 bits.
    By limiting the variable with short type u8 issue is resolved.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54245 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
