Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix a potential data corruption

We must ensure that the subrequests are joined back into the head before
we can retransmit a request. If the head was not on the commit lists,
because the server wrote it synchronously, we still need to add it back
to the retransmission list.
Add a call that mirrors the effect of nfs_cancel_remove_inode() for
O_DIRECT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
