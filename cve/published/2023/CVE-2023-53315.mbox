Subject: CVE-2023-53315: wifi: ath11k: Fix SKB corruption in REO destination ring

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Fix SKB corruption in REO destination ring

While running traffics for a long time, randomly an RX descriptor
filled with value "0" from REO destination ring is received.
This descriptor which is invalid causes the wrong SKB (SKB stored in
the IDR lookup with buffer id "0") to be fetched which in turn
causes SKB memory corruption issue and the same leads to crash
after some time.

Changed the start id for idr allocation to "1" and the buffer id "0"
is reserved for error validation. Introduced Sanity check to validate
the descriptor, before processing the SKB.

Crash Signature :

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 3f004900
PC points to "b15_dma_inv_range+0x30/0x50"
LR points to "dma_cache_maint_page+0x8c/0x128".

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
