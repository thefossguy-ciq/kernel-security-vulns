Subject: CVE-2023-53321: wifi: mac80211_hwsim: drop short frames

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211_hwsim: drop short frames

While technically some control frames like ACK are shorter and
end after Address 1, such frames shouldn't be forwarded through
wmediumd or similar userspace, so require the full 3-address
header to avoid accessing invalid memory if shorter frames are
passed in.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53321 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
