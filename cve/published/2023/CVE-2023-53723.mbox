Subject: CVE-2023-53723: drm/amdgpu: disable sdma ecc irq only when sdma RAS is enabled in suspend

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: disable sdma ecc irq only when sdma RAS is enabled in suspend

sdma_v4_0_ip is shared on a few asics, but in sdma_v4_0_hw_fini,
driver unconditionally disables ecc_irq which is only enabled on
those asics enabling sdma ecc. This will introduce a warning in
suspend cycle on those chips with sdma ip v4.0, while without
sdma ecc. So this patch correct this.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
