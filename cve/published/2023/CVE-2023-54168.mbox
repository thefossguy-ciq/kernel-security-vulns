Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx4: Prevent shift wrapping in set_user_sq_size()

The ucmd->log_sq_bb_count variable is controlled by the user so this
shift can wrap.  Fix it by using check_shl_overflow() in the same way
that it was done in commit 515f60004ed9 ("RDMA/hns: Prevent undefined
behavior in hns_roce_set_user_sq_size()").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54168 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
