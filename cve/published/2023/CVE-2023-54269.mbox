Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: double free xprt_ctxt while still in use

When an RPC request is deferred, the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is moved out
of the svc_rqst into the svc_deferred_req.
When the deferred request is revisited, the pointer is copied into
the new svc_rqst - and also remains in the svc_deferred_req.

In the (rare?) case that the request is deferred a second time, the old
svc_deferred_req is reused - it still has all the correct content.
However in that case the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is NOT cleared so that
when xpo_release_xprt is called, the ctxt is freed (UDP) or possible
added to a free list (RDMA).
When the deferred request is revisited for a second time, it will
reference this ctxt which may be invalid, and the free the object a
second time which is likely to oops.

So change svc_defer() to *always* clear rq_xprt_ctxt, and assert that
the value is now stored in the svc_deferred_req.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
