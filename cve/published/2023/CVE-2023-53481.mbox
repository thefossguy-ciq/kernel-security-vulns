Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubi: ubi_wl_put_peb: Fix infinite loop when wear-leveling work failed

Following process will trigger an infinite loop in ubi_wl_put_peb():

	ubifs_bgt		ubi_bgt
ubifs_leb_unmap
  ubi_leb_unmap
    ubi_eba_unmap_leb
      ubi_wl_put_peb	wear_leveling_worker
                          e1 = rb_entry(rb_first(&ubi->used)
			  e2 = get_peb_for_wl(ubi)
			  ubi_io_read_vid_hdr  // return err (flash fault)
			  out_error:
			    ubi->move_from = ubi->move_to = NULL
			    wl_entry_destroy(ubi, e1)
			      ubi->lookuptbl[e->pnum] = NULL
      retry:
        e = ubi->lookuptbl[pnum];	// return NULL
	if (e == ubi->move_from) {	// NULL == NULL gets true
	  goto retry;			// infinite loop !!!

$ top
  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     COMMAND
  7676 root     20   0       0      0      0 R 100.0  0.0  ubifs_bgt0_0

Fix it by:
 1) Letting ubi_wl_put_peb() returns directly if wearl leveling entry has
    been removed from 'ubi->lookuptbl'.
 2) Using 'ubi->wl_lock' protecting wl entry deletion to preventing an
    use-after-free problem for wl entry in ubi_wl_put_peb().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53481 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
