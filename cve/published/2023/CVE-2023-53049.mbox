Subject: CVE-2023-53049: usb: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: ucsi: Fix NULL pointer deref in ucsi_connector_change()

When ucsi_init() fails, ucsi->connector is NULL, yet in case of
ucsi_acpi we may still get events which cause the ucs_acpi code to call
ucsi_connector_change(), which then derefs the NULL ucsi->connector
pointer.

Fix this by not setting ucsi->ntfy inside ucsi_init() until ucsi_init()
has succeeded, so that ucsi_connector_change() ignores the events
because UCSI_ENABLE_NTFY_CONNECTOR_CHANGE is not set in the ntfy mask.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
