Ben bisected and found that commit 0495e337b703 ("mm/slab_common:
Deleting kobject in kmem_cache_destroy() without holding
slab_mutex/cpu_hotplug_lock") first exposed dm-cache's incomplete
cleanup of its background tracker work objects.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53765 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
