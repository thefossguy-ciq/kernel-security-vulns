Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: prevent deadlock by moving j1939_sk_errqueue()

This commit addresses a deadlock situation that can occur in certain
scenarios, such as when running data TP/ETP transfer and subscribing to
the error queue while receiving a net down event. The deadlock involves
locks in the following order:

3
  j1939_session_list_lock ->  active_session_list_lock
  j1939_session_activate
  ...
  j1939_sk_queue_activate_next -> sk_session_queue_lock
  ...
  j1939_xtp_rx_eoma_one

2
  j1939_sk_queue_drop_all  ->  sk_session_queue_lock
  ...
  j1939_sk_netdev_event_netdown -> j1939_socks_lock
  j1939_netdev_notify

1
  j1939_sk_errqueue -> j1939_socks_lock
  __j1939_session_cancel -> active_session_list_lock
  j1939_tp_rxtimer

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(&priv->active_session_list_lock);
                               lock(&jsk->sk_session_queue_lock);
                               lock(&priv->active_session_list_lock);
  lock(&priv->j1939_socks_lock);

The solution implemented in this commit is to move the
j1939_sk_errqueue() call out of the active_session_list_lock context,
thus preventing the deadlock situation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54152 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
