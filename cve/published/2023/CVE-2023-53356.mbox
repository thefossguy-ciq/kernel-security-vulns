Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_suspend

Consider a case where gserial_disconnect has already cleared
gser->ioport. And if gserial_suspend gets called afterwards,
it will lead to accessing of gser->ioport and thus causing
null pointer dereference.

Avoid this by adding a null pointer check. Added a static
spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming null after
the newly added null pointer check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53356 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
