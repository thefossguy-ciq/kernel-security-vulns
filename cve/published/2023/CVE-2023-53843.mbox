Subject: CVE-2023-53843: net: openvswitch: reject negative ifindex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: reject negative ifindex

Recent changes in net-next (commit 759ab1edb56c ("net: store netdevs
in an xarray")) refactored the handling of pre-assigned ifindexes
and let syzbot surface a latent problem in ovs. ovs does not validate
ifindex, making it possible to create netdev ports with negative
ifindex values. It's easy to repro with YNL:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_datapath.yaml \
         --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": 1, "name":"my-dp"}'
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

$ ip link show
-65536: some-port0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 7a:48:21:ad:0b:fb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
...

Validate the inputs. Now the second command correctly returns:

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid": "00000001", "name": "some-port0", "dp-ifindex":3,"ifindex":4294901760,"type":2}'

lib.ynl.NlError: Netlink error: Numerical result out of range
nl_len = 108 (92) nl_flags = 0x300 nl_type = 2
	error: -34	extack: {'msg': 'integer out of range', 'unknown': [[type:4 len:36] b'\x0c\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0c\x00\x03\x00\xff\xff\xff\x7f\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08\x00\x01\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00'], 'bad-attr': '.ifindex'}

Accept 0 since it used to be silently ignored.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53843 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
