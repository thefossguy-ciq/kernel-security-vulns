Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path

The cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the
function is entered. This reference is released when the function is
exited. There is currently one error path where the function exits
directly, which leads to a leak of the runtime PM reference.

Make sure that this error path also releases the runtime PM reference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54009 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
