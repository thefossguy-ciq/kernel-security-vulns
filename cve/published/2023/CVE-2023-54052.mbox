Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7921: fix skb leak by txs missing in AMSDU

txs may be dropped if the frame is aggregated in AMSDU. When the problem
shows up, some SKBs would be hold in driver to cause network stopped
temporarily. Even if the problem can be recovered by txs timeout handling,
mt7921 still need to disable txs in AMSDU to avoid this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54052 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
