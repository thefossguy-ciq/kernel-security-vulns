Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/powernv/sriov: perform null check on iov before dereferencing iov

Currently pointer iov is being dereferenced before the null check of iov
which can lead to null pointer dereference errors. Fix this by moving the
iov null check before the dereferencing.

Detected using cppcheck static analysis:
linux/arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/pci-sriov.c:597:12: warning: Either
the condition '!iov' is redundant or there is possible null pointer
dereference: iov. [nullPointerRedundantCheck]
 num_vfs = iov->num_vfs;
           ^

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54315 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07c19c0ad4b07f4b598da369714de028f6a6a323
