Subject: CVE-2023-54047: drm/rockchip: dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/rockchip: dw_hdmi: cleanup drm encoder during unbind

This fixes a use-after-free crash during rmmod.

The DRM encoder is embedded inside the larger rockchip_hdmi,
which is allocated with the component. The component memory
gets freed before the main drm device is destroyed. Fix it
by running encoder cleanup before tearing down its container.

[moved encoder cleanup above clk_disable, similar to bind-error-path]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54047 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
