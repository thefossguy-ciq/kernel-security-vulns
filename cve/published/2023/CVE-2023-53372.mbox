Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: fix a potential overflow in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip

Currently, when traversing ifwdtsn skips with _sctp_walk_ifwdtsn, it only
checks the pos against the end of the chunk. However, the data left for
the last pos may be < sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip), and dereference
it as struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip may cause coverflow.

This patch fixes it by checking the pos against "the end of the chunk -
sizeof(struct sctp_ifwdtsn_skip)" in sctp_ifwdtsn_skip, similar to
sctp_fwdtsn_skip.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53372 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
