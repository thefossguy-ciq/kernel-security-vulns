Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: remove a BUG_ON in ext4_mb_release_group_pa()

If a malicious fuzzer overwrites the ext4 superblock while it is
mounted such that the s_first_data_block is set to a very large
number, the calculation of the block group can underflow, and trigger
a BUG_ON check.  Change this to be an ext4_warning so that we don't
crash the kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53450 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
