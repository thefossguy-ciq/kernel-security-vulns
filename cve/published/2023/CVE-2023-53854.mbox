Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: mt8186: Fix use-after-free in driver remove path

When devm runs function in the "remove" path for a device it runs them
in the reverse order. That means that if you have parts of your driver
that aren't using devm or are using "roll your own" devm w/
devm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.

The mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in
mt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then
went on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of
mt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call
mt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,
the order was wrong.

Specifically at probe time, the order was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()
2. afe_priv->clk = devm_kcalloc(...)
3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)

At remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was:
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()
3. Free all of afe_priv->clk[i]
2. Free afe_priv->clk

The above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to
fix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let's move the
devm_add_action_or_reset() to the right place. In addition to fixing
the use-after-free, code inspection shows that this fixes a leak
(missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have
happened if any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in
mt8186_init_clock() had failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53854 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
