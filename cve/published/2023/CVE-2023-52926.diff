 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
 
-io_uring/rw: split io_read() into a helper
-
-Add __io_read() which does the grunt of the work, leaving the completion
-side to the new io_read(). No functional changes in this patch.
+IORING_OP_READ did not correctly consume the provided buffer list when
+read i/o returned < 0 (except for -EAGAIN and -EIOCBQUEUED return).
+This can lead to a potential use-after-free when the completion via
+io_rw_done runs at separate context.
