Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: freescale: Fix a memory out of bounds when num_configs is 1

The config passed in by pad wakeup is 1, when num_configs is 1,

by KASAN as a memory out of bounds condition. Modify to get
configs[1] when num_configs is 2.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53750 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
