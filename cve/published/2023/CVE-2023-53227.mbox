Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: dirty_cow_znode: Fix memleak in error handling path

Following process will cause a memleak for copied up znode:

dirty_cow_znode
  zn = copy_znode(c, znode);
  err = insert_old_idx(c, zbr->lnum, zbr->offs);
  if (unlikely(err))
     return ERR_PTR(err);   // No one refers to zn.

Fix it by adding copied znode back to tnc, then it will be freed
by ubifs_destroy_tnc_subtree() while closing tnc.

Fetch a reproducer in [Link].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
