Subject: CVE-2023-54310: scsi: message: mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: message: mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition

mptlan_probe() calls mpt_register_lan_device() which initializes the
&priv->post_buckets_task workqueue. A call to
mpt_lan_wake_post_buckets_task() will subsequently start the work.

During driver unload in mptlan_remove() the following race may occur:

CPU0                  CPU1

                    |mpt_lan_post_receive_buckets_work()
mptlan_remove()     |
  free_netdev()     |
    kfree(dev);     |
                    |
                    | dev->mtu
                    |   //use

Fix this by finishing the work prior to cleaning up in mptlan_remove().

[mkp: we really should remove mptlan instead of attempting to fix it]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54310 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
