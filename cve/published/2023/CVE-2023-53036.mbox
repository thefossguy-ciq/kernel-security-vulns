Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix call trace warning and hang when removing amdgpu device

On GPUs with RAS enabled, below call trace and hang are observed when
shutting down device.

v2: use DRM device unplugged flag instead of shutdown flag as the check to
prevent memory wipe in shutdown stage.

	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_object.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f06b902511ea05526f405ee64da54a8313d91831
