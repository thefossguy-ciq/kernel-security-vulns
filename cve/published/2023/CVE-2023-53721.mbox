Subject: CVE-2023-53721: wifi: ath12k: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in ath12k_mac_op_hw_scan()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in ath12k_mac_op_hw_scan()

In ath12k_mac_op_hw_scan(), the return value of kzalloc() is directly
used in memcpy(), which may lead to a NULL pointer dereference on
failure of kzalloc().

Fix this bug by adding a check of arg.extraie.ptr.

Tested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0-03427-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-1.15378.4

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
