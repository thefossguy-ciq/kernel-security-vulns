Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: fix workqueue leak on bind errors

Make sure to destroy the workqueue also in case of early errors during
bind (e.g. a subcomponent failing to bind).

Since commit c3b790ea07a1 ("drm: Manage drm_mode_config_init with
drmm_") the mode config will be freed when the drm device is released
also when using the legacy interface, but add an explicit cleanup for
consistency and to facilitate backporting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
