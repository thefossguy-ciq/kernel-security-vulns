Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Mark PCIe controller as cache coherent

If the controller is not marked as cache coherent, then kernel will
try to ensure coherency during dma-ops and that may cause data corruption.
So, mark the PCIe node as dma-coherent as the devices on PCIe bus are
cache coherent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53043 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/267b899375bf38944d915c9654d6eb434edad0ce
