Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: dp83822: Fix null pointer access on DP83825/DP83826 devices

The probe() function is only used for the DP83822 PHY, leaving the
private data pointer uninitialized for the smaller DP83825/26 models.
While all uses of the private data structure are hidden in 82822 specific
callbacks, configuring the interrupt is shared across all models.
This causes a NULL pointer dereference on the smaller PHYs as it accesses
the private data unchecked. Verifying the pointer avoids that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52984 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
