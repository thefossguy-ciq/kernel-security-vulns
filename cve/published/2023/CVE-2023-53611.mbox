Subject: CVE-2023-53611: ipmi_si: fix a memleak in try_smi_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipmi_si: fix a memleak in try_smi_init()

Kmemleak reported the following leak info in try_smi_init():

unreferenced object 0xffff00018ecf9400 (size 1024):
  comm "modprobe", pid 2707763, jiffies 4300851415 (age 773.308s)

    [<0000000030a59039>] el0_sync+0x160/0x180

The problem was that when an error occurred before handlers registration
and after allocating `new_smi->si_sm`, the variable wouldn't be freed in
the error handling afterwards since `shutdown_smi()` hadn't been
registered yet. Fix it by adding a `kfree()` in the error handling path
in `try_smi_init()`.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53611 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
