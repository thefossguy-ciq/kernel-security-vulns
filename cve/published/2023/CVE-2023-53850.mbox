Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: use internal state to free traffic IRQs

If the system tries to close the netdev while iavf_reset_task() is
running, __LINK_STATE_START will be cleared and netif_running() will
return false in iavf_reinit_interrupt_scheme(). This will result in
iavf_free_traffic_irqs() not being called and a leak as follows:

    [7632.489326] remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/999', leaking at least 'iavf-enp24s0f0v0-TxRx-0'
    [7632.490214] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at fs/proc/generic.c:718 remove_proc_entry+0x19b/0x1b0

is shown when pci_disable_msix() is later called. Fix by using the
internal adapter state. The traffic IRQs will always exist if
state == __IAVF_RUNNING.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
