Subject: CVE-2023-4130: ksmbd: fix wrong next length validation of ea buffer in smb2_set_ea()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix wrong next length validation of ea buffer in smb2_set_ea()

There are multiple smb2_ea_info buffers in FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION request
from client. ksmbd find next smb2_ea_info using ->NextEntryOffset of
current smb2_ea_info. ksmbd need to validate buffer length Before
accessing the next ea. ksmbd should check buffer length using buf_len,
not next variable. next is the start offset of current ea that got from
previous ea.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-4130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
