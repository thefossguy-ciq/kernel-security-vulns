Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: Avoid touching renamed directory if parent does not change

its parent does not change as without locking that can corrupt the
filesystem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52590 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.7.4 with commit de940cede3c4
	Fixed in 6.8-rc1 with commit 9d618d19b29c

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
