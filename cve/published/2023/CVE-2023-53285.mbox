Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add bounds checking in get_max_inline_xattr_value_size()

Normally the extended attributes in the inode body would have been
checked when the inode is first opened, but if someone is writing to
the block device while the file system is mounted, it's possible for
the inode table to get corrupted.  Add bounds checking to avoid
reading beyond the end of allocated memory if this happens.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
