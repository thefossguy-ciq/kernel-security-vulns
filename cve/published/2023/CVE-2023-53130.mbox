Subject: CVE-2023-53130: block: fix wrong mode for blkdev_put() from disk_scan_partitions()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix wrong mode for blkdev_put() from disk_scan_partitions()

If disk_scan_partitions() is called with 'FMODE_EXCL',
blkdev_get_by_dev() will be called without 'FMODE_EXCL', however, follow
blkdev_put() is still called with 'FMODE_EXCL', which will cause
'bd_holders' counter to leak.

Fix the problem by using the right mode for blkdev_put().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53130 to this issue.

===========================

	Issue fixed in mainline with commit 428913b

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
