Subject: CVE-2023-54171: tracing: Fix memory leak of iter->temp when reading trace_pipe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix memory leak of iter->temp when reading trace_pipe

kmemleak reports:
  unreferenced object 0xffff88814d14e200 (size 256):
    comm "cat", pid 336, jiffies 4294871818 (age 779.490s)

      [<ffffffff9d2000aa>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0xd8

when reading file 'trace_pipe', 'iter->temp' is allocated or relocated
in trace_find_next_entry() but not freed before 'trace_pipe' is closed.

To fix it, free 'iter->temp' in tracing_release_pipe().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54171 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
