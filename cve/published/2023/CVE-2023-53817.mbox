Subject: CVE-2023-53817: crypto: lib/mpi - avoid null pointer deref in mpi_cmp_ui()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: lib/mpi - avoid null pointer deref in mpi_cmp_ui()

During NVMeTCP Authentication a controller can trigger a kernel
oops by specifying the 8192 bit Diffie Hellman group and passing
a correctly sized, but zeroed Diffie Hellamn value.
mpi_cmp_ui() was detecting this if the second parameter was 0,
but 1 is passed from dh_is_pubkey_valid(). This causes the null
pointer u->d to be dereferenced towards the end of mpi_cmp_ui()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53817 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
