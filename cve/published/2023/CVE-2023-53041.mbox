Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Perform lockless command completion in abort path

While adding and removing the controller, the following call trace was
observed:

WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 623596 at kernel/dma/mapping.c:532 dma_free_attrs+0x33/0x50
CPU: 3 PID: 623596 Comm: sh Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.14.0-96.el9.x86_64 #1

The command was completed in the abort path during driver unload with a
lock held, causing the warning in abort path. Hence complete the command
without any lock held.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53041 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
