Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

reiserfs: Avoid touching renamed directory if parent does not change

if its parent does not change as without locking that can corrupt the
filesystem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52591 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.6.16 with commit 17e1361cb91d
	Fixed in 6.7.4 with commit c04c162f82ac

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
