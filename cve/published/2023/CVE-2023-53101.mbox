Subject: CVE-2023-53101: ext4: zero i_disksize when initializing the bootloader inode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: zero i_disksize when initializing the bootloader inode

If the boot loader inode has never been used before, the
EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT inode will initialize it, including setting the
i_size to 0.  However, if the "never before used" boot loader has a
non-zero i_size, then i_disksize will be non-zero, and the
inconsistency between i_size and i_disksize can trigger a kernel
warning:

 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2580 at fs/ext4/file.c:319
 CPU: 0 PID: 2580 Comm: bb Not tainted 6.3.0-rc1-00004-g703695902cfa
 RIP: 0010:ext4_file_write_iter+0xbc7/0xd10
 Call Trace:
  vfs_write+0x3b1/0x5c0
  ksys_write+0x77/0x160
  __x64_sys_write+0x22/0x30
  do_syscall_64+0x39/0x80

Reproducer:
 1. create corrupted image and mount it:
       mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 200
       debugfs -wR "sif <5> size 25700" /tmp/foo.img
       mount -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img /mnt
       cd /mnt
       echo 123 > file
 2. Run the reproducer program:
       posix_memalign(&buf, 1024, 1024)
       fd = open("file", O_RDWR | O_DIRECT);
       ioctl(fd, EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT);
       write(fd, buf, 1024);

Fix this by setting i_disksize as well as i_size to zero when
initiaizing the boot loader inode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
