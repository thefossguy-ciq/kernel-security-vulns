Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: pcie: Fix integer overflow in iwl_write_to_user_buf

An integer overflow occurs in the iwl_write_to_user_buf() function,
which is called by the iwl_dbgfs_monitor_data_read() function.

static bool iwl_write_to_user_buf(char __user *user_buf, ssize_t count,
				  void *buf, ssize_t *size,
				  ssize_t *bytes_copied)
{
	int buf_size_left = count - *bytes_copied;

	buf_size_left = buf_size_left - (buf_size_left % sizeof(u32));
	if (*size > buf_size_left)
		*size = buf_size_left;

If the user passes a SIZE_MAX value to the "ssize_t count" parameter,
the ssize_t count parameter is assigned to "int buf_size_left".
Then compare "*size" with "buf_size_left" . Here, "buf_size_left" is a
negative number, so "*size" is assigned "buf_size_left" and goes into
the third argument of the copy_to_user function, causing a heap overflow.

This is not a security vulnerability because iwl_dbgfs_monitor_data_read()
is a debugfs operation with 0400 privileges.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53524 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
