Subject: CVE-2023-53172: fsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsverity: reject FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY on mode 3 fds

Commit 56124d6c87fd ("fsverity: support enabling with tree block size <
PAGE_SIZE") changed FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY to use __kernel_read() to read
the file's data, instead of direct pagecache accesses.

An unintended consequence of this is that the
'WARN_ON_ONCE(!(file->f_mode & FMODE_READ))' in __kernel_read() became
reachable by fuzz tests.  This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called
on a fd opened with access mode 3, which means "ioctl access only".

Arguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only fds.  But
ioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that
few people even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY
even specifically says it requires O_RDONLY.)  It's probably not
worthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just to handle
this case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53172 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
