Subject: CVE-2023-53146: media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()

In dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf
is null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be
passed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing
msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.
We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.

("[media] dw2102: limit messages to buffer size")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53146 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
