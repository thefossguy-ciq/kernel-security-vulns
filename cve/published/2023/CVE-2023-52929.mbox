Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmem: core: fix cleanup after dev_set_name()

If dev_set_name() fails, we leak nvmem->wp_gpio as the cleanup does not
put this. While a minimal fix for this would be to add the gpiod_put()
call, we can do better if we split device_register(), and use the
tested nvmem_release() cleanup code by initialising the device early,
and putting the device.

This results in a slightly larger fix, but results in clear code.

Note: this patch depends on "nvmem: core: initialise nvmem->id early"
and "nvmem: core: remove nvmem_config wp_gpio".

[Srini: Fixed subject line and error code handing with wp_gpio while applying.]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
