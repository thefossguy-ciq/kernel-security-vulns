Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: pcf50633-adc: Fix potential memleak in pcf50633_adc_async_read()

`req` is allocated in pcf50633_adc_async_read(), but
adc_enqueue_request() could fail to insert the `req` into queue.
We need to check the return value and free it in the case of failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53724 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
