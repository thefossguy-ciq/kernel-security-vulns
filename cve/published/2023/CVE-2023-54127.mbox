JFS_SBI(ipbmap->i_sb)->bmap wasn't set to NULL after kfree() in
dbUnmount().

Syzkaller uses faultinject to reproduce this KASAN double-free
warning. The issue is triggered if either diMount() or dbMount() fail
in jfs_remount(), since diUnmount() or dbUnmount() already happened in
such a case - they will do double-free on next execution: jfs_umount
or jfs_remount.

Tested on both upstream and jfs-next by syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54127 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
