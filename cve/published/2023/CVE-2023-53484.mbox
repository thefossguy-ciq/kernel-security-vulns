Subject: CVE-2023-53484: lib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries

When calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify
argument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the
corresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A
subsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again
leading to possible use after free.

Fix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have
non-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in
free_irq_cpu_rmap().

The current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases
where irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the
notify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we
don't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this
flow, hence the required fix.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53484 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
