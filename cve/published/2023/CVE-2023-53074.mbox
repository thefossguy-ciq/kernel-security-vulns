Subject: CVE-2023-53074: drm/amdgpu: fix ttm_bo calltrace warning in psp_hw_fini

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix ttm_bo calltrace warning in psp_hw_fini

The call trace occurs when the amdgpu is removed after
the mode1 reset. During mode1 reset, from suspend to resume,
there is no need to reinitialize the ta firmware buffer
which caused the bo pin_count increase redundantly.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7be9a2f8c5179520a7d5570e648e0c97d09e4fae
