Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: realtek: fix out-of-bounds access

The probe function sets priv->chip_data to (void *)priv + sizeof(*priv)
with the expectation that priv has enough trailing space.

However, only realtek-smi actually allocated this chip_data space.
Do likewise in realtek-mdio to fix out-of-bounds accesses.

These accesses likely went unnoticed so far, because of an (unused)
buf[4096] member in struct realtek_priv, which caused kmalloc to
round up the allocated buffer to a big enough size, so nothing of
value was overwritten. With a different allocator (like in the barebox
bootloader port of the driver) or with KASAN, the memory corruption
becomes quickly apparent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc0f9bb99735d2b68fac68f37b585d615728ce5b
