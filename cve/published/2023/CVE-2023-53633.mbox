Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/qaic: Fix a leak in map_user_pages()

If get_user_pages_fast() allocates some pages but not as many as we
wanted, then the current code leaks those pages.  Call put_page() on
the pages before returning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53633 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdcba752a3d48fbe6f05cf2c91ab9497c8daad0c
