Subject: CVE-2023-53992: wifi: cfg80211: ocb: don't leave if not joined

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: ocb: don't leave if not joined

If there's no OCB state, don't ask the driver/mac80211 to
leave, since that's just confusing. Since set/clear the
chandef state, that's a simple check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53992 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
