Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Bad drive in topology results kernel crash

When the SAS Transport Layer support is enabled and a device exposed to
the OS by the driver fails INQUIRY commands, the driver frees up the memory
allocated for an internal HBA port data structure. However, in some places,
the reference to the freed memory is not cleared. When the firmware sends
the Device Info change event for the same device again, the freed memory is
accessed and that leads to memory corruption and OS crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53037 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.22 with commit 1f822ae8fb2a20fffa71e9bfa9b203c03d72d3ba

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53037
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f822ae8fb2a20fffa71e9bfa9b203c03d72d3ba
