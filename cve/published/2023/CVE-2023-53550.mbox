Subject: CVE-2023-53550: cpufreq: amd-pstate: fix global sysfs attribute type

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: amd-pstate: fix global sysfs attribute type

In commit 3666062b87ec ("cpufreq: amd-pstate: move to use bus_get_dev_root()")
the "amd_pstate" attributes where moved from a dedicated kobject to the
cpu root kobject.

While the dedicated kobject expects to contain kobj_attributes the root
kobject needs device_attributes.

As the changed arguments are not used by the callbacks it works most of
the time.
However CFI will detect this issue:

[ 4947.849350] CFI failure at dev_attr_show+0x24/0x60 (target: show_status+0x0/0x70; expected type: 0x8651b1de)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddcfc33a20380508f7fea18e1c330abe17ed4fc0
