Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer

Though we do check the event ring read pointer by "is_valid_ring_ptr"
to make sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the
pointer may be not aligned.  Since we are expecting event ring elements
are 128 bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer
could lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption.

So add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52494 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/bus/mhi/host/main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
