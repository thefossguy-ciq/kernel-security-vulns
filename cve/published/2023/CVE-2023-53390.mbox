Subject: CVE-2023-53390: drivers: base: dd: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: base: dd: fix memory leak with using debugfs_lookup()

When calling debugfs_lookup() the result must have dput() called on it,
otherwise the memory will leak over time.  To make things simpler, just
call debugfs_lookup_and_remove() instead which handles all of the logic
at once.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53390 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
