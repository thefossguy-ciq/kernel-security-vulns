Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver core: fix resource leak in device_add()

When calling kobject_add() failed in device_add(), it will call
cleanup_glue_dir() to free resource. But in kobject_add(),
dev->kobj.parent has been set to NULL. This will cause resource leak.

The process is as follows:
device_add()
	get_device_parent()
		class_dir_create_and_add()
			kobject_add()		//kobject_get()
	...
	dev->kobj.parent = kobj;
	...
	kobject_add()		//failed, but set dev->kobj.parent = NULL
	...
	glue_dir = get_glue_dir(dev)	//glue_dir = NULL, and goto
					//"Error" label
	...
	cleanup_glue_dir()	//becaues glue_dir is NULL, not call
				//kobject_put()

The preceding problem may cause insmod mac80211_hwsim.ko to failed.
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/virtual/mac80211_hwsim'

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
