Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: Rework long task execution when adding/deleting entries

When adding/deleting large number of elements in one step in ipset, it can
take a reasonable amount of time and can result in soft lockup errors. The
patch 5f7b51bf09ba ("netfilter: ipset: Limit the maximal range of
consecutive elements to add/delete") tried to fix it by limiting the max
elements to process at all. However it was not enough, it is still possible
that we get hung tasks. Lowering the limit is not reasonable, so the
approach in this patch is as follows: rely on the method used at resizing
sets and save the state when we reach a smaller internal batch limit,
unlock/lock and proceed from the saved state. Thus we can avoid long
continuous tasks and at the same time removed the limit to add/delete large
number of elements in one step.

The nfnl mutex is held during the whole operation which prevents one to
issue other ipset commands in parallel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53549 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
