Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: mcp-2221: prevent UAF in delayed work

If the device is plugged/unplugged without giving time for mcp_init_work()
to complete, we might kick in the devm free code path and thus have
unavailable struct mcp_2221 while in delayed work.

Canceling the delayed_work item is enough to solve the issue, because
cancel_delayed_work_sync will prevent the work item to requeue itself.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53459 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5dc297652dbc557eba7ca7d6a4c5f1940dffffb1
