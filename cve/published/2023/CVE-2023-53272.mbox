Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ena: fix shift-out-of-bounds in exponential backoff

The ENA adapters on our instances occasionally reset.  Once recently
logged a UBSAN failure to console in the process:

  UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in build/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/amazon/ena/ena_com.c:540:13
  shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'
  CPU: 28 PID: 70012 Comm: kworker/u72:2 Kdump: loaded not tainted 5.15.117
  Hardware name: Amazon EC2 c5d.9xlarge/, BIOS 1.0 10/16/2017
  Workqueue: ena ena_fw_reset_device [ena]

  </TASK>

Apparently, the reset delays are getting so large they can trigger a
UBSAN panic.

Looking at the code, the current timeout is capped at 5000us.  Using a
base value of 100us, the current code will overflow after (1<<29).  Even
at values before 32, this function wraps around, perhaps
unintentionally.

Cap the value of the exponent used for this backoff at (1<<16) which is
larger than currently necessary, but large enough to support bigger
values in the future.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53272 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
