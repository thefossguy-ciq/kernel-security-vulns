Subject: CVE-2023-54107: blk-cgroup: dropping parent refcount after pd_free_fn() is done

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-cgroup: dropping parent refcount after pd_free_fn() is done

Some cgroup policies will access parent pd through child pd even
after pd_offline_fn() is done. If pd_free_fn() for parent is called
before child, then UAF can be triggered. Hence it's better to guarantee
the order of pd_free_fn().

Currently refcount of parent blkg is dropped in __blkg_release(), which
is before pd_free_fn() is called in blkg_free_work_fn() while
blkg_free_work_fn() is called asynchronously.

This patch make sure pd_free_fn() called from removing cgroup is ordered
by delaying dropping parent refcount after calling pd_free_fn() for
child.

BTW, pd_free_fn() will also be called from blkcg_deactivate_policy()
from deleting device, and following patches will guarantee the order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54107 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
