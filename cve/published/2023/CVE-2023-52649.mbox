Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vkms: Avoid reading beyond LUT array

When the floor LUT index (drm_fixp2int(lut_index) is the last
index of the array the ceil LUT index will point to an entry
beyond the array. Make sure we guard against it and use the
value of the floor LUT index.

v3:
 - Drop bits from commit description that didn't contribute
   anything of value

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52649 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
