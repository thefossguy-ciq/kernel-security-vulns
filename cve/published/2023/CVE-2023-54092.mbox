Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: s390: pv: fix index value of replaced ASCE

The index field of the struct page corresponding to a guest ASCE should
be 0. When replacing the ASCE in s390_replace_asce(), the index of the
new ASCE should also be set to 0.

Having the wrong index might lead to the wrong addresses being passed
around when notifying pte invalidations, and eventually to validity
intercepts (VM crash) if the prefix gets unmapped and the notifier gets
called with the wrong address.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
