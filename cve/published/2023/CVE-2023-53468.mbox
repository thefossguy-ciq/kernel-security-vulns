Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Fix memory leak in alloc_wbufs()

kmemleak reported a sequence of memory leaks, and show them as following:

  unreferenced object 0xffff8881575f8400 (size 1024):

      [<ffffffff83e0006a>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

The problem is that the ubifs_wbuf_init() returns an error in the
loop which in the alloc_wbufs(), then the wbuf->buf and wbuf->inodes
that were successfully alloced before are not freed.

Fix it by adding error hanging path in alloc_wbufs() which frees
the memory alloced before when ubifs_wbuf_init() returns an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53468 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
