Subject: CVE-2023-53052: cifs: fix use-after-free bug in refresh_cache_worker()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix use-after-free bug in refresh_cache_worker()

The UAF bug occurred because we were putting DFS root sessions in
cifs_umount() while DFS cache refresher was being executed.

Make DFS root sessions have same lifetime as DFS tcons so we can avoid
the use-after-free bug is DFS cache refresher and other places that
require IPCs to get new DFS referrals on.  Also, get rid of mount
group handling in DFS cache as we no longer need it.

This fixes below use-after-free bug catched by KASAN

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
