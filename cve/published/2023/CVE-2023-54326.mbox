Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: pci_endpoint_test: Free IRQs before removing the device

In pci_endpoint_test_remove(), freeing the IRQs after removing the device
creates a small race window for IRQs to be received with the test device
memory already released, causing the IRQ handler to access invalid memory,
resulting in an oops.

Free the device IRQs before removing the device to avoid this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54326 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
