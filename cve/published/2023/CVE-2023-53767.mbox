Subject: CVE-2023-53767: wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_qmi_driver_event_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_qmi_driver_event_work()

Currently the buffer pointed by event is not freed in case
ATH12K_FLAG_UNREGISTERING bit is set, this causes memory leak.

Add a goto skip instead of return, to ensure event and all the
list entries are freed properly.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53767 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
