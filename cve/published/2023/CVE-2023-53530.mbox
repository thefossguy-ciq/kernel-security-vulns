Subject: CVE-2023-53530: scsi: qla2xxx: Use raw_smp_processor_id() instead of smp_processor_id()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Use raw_smp_processor_id() instead of smp_processor_id()

The following call trace was observed:

localhost kernel: nvme nvme0: NVME-FC{0}: controller connect complete
localhost kernel: BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: kworker/u129:4/75092

Use raw_smp_processor_id() instead of smp_processor_id().

Also use queue_work() across the driver instead of queue_work_on() thus
avoiding usage of smp_processor_id() when CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53530 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
