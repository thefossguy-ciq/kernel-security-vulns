Subject: CVE-2023-53222: jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting

In jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block
number inside dbFree(). db_l2nbperpage, which is the log2 number of
blocks per page, is passed as an argument to BLKTODMAP which uses it
for shifting.

Syzbot reported a shift out-of-bounds crash because db_l2nbperpage is
too big. This happens because the large value is set without any
validation in dbMount() at line 181.

Thus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.

Max number of blocks per page = Page size / Min block size
=> log2(Max num_block per page) = log2(Page size / Min block size)
				= log2(Page size) - log2(Min block size)

=> Max db_l2nbperpage = L2PSIZE - L2MINBLOCKSIZE

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
