Subject: CVE-2023-54252: platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix memory leaks when parsing ThinkStation WMI strings

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix memory leaks when parsing ThinkStation WMI strings

My previous commit introduced a memory leak where the item allocated
from tlmi_setting was not freed.
This commit also renames it to avoid confusion with the similarly name
variable in the same function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54252 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
