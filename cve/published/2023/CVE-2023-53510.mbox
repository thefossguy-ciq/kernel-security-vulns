Subject: CVE-2023-53510: scsi: ufs: core: Fix handling of lrbp->cmd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix handling of lrbp->cmd

ufshcd_queuecommand() may be called two times in a row for a SCSI command
before it is completed. Hence make the following changes:

 - In the functions that submit a command, do not check the old value of
   lrbp->cmd nor clear lrbp->cmd in error paths.

 - In ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd(), do not clear lrbp->cmd.

See also scsi_send_eh_cmnd().

This commit prevents that the following appears if a command times out:

WARNING: at drivers/ufs/core/ufshcd.c:2965 ufshcd_queuecommand+0x6f8/0x9a8

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
