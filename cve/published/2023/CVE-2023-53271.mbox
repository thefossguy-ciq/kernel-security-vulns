Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubi: Fix unreferenced object reported by kmemleak in ubi_resize_volume()

There is a memory leaks problem reported by kmemleak:

unreferenced object 0xffff888102007a00 (size 128):
  comm "ubirsvol", pid 32090, jiffies 4298464136 (age 2361.231s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................
ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................
  backtrace:
[<ffffffff8176cecd>] __kmalloc+0x4d/0x150
[<ffffffffa02a9a36>] ubi_eba_create_table+0x76/0x170 [ubi]
[<ffffffffa029764e>] ubi_resize_volume+0x1be/0xbc0 [ubi]
[<ffffffffa02a3321>] ubi_cdev_ioctl+0x701/0x1850 [ubi]

[<ffffffff83c142a5>] do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80
[<ffffffff83e0006a>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0

This is due to a mismatch between create and destroy interfaces, and
in detail that "new_eba_tbl" created by ubi_eba_create_table() but
destroyed by kfree(), while will causing "new_eba_tbl->entries" not
freed.

Fix it by replacing kfree(new_eba_tbl) with
ubi_eba_destroy_table(new_eba_tbl)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53271 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
