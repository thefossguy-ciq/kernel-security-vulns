Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: Detect system inodes linked into directory hierarchy

When UDF filesystem is corrupted, hidden system inodes can be linked
into directory hierarchy which is an avenue for further serious
corruption of the filesystem and kernel confusion as noticed by syzbot
fuzzed images. Refuse to access system inodes linked into directory
hierarchy and vice versa.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53695 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
