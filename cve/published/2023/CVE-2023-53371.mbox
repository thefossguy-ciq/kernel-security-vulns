Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: fix memory leak in mlx5e_fs_tt_redirect_any_create

The memory pointed to by the fs->any pointer is not freed in the error
path of mlx5e_fs_tt_redirect_any_create, which can lead to a memory leak.
Fix by freeing the memory in the error path, thereby making the error path
identical to mlx5e_fs_tt_redirect_any_destroy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53371 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
