Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix BUG in ext4_mb_new_inode_pa() due to overflow

When we calculate the end position of ext4_free_extent, this position may
be exactly where ext4_lblk_t (i.e. uint) overflows. For example, if
ac_g_ex.fe_logical is 4294965248 and ac_orig_goal_len is 2048, then the
computed end is 0x100000000, which is 0. If ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical is not
the first case of adjusting the best extent, that is, new_bex_end > 0, the
following BUG_ON will be triggered:

A simple reproducer demonstrating the problem:

	mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sda -b 4096 100M
	mount /dev/sda /tmp/test
	fallocate -l1M /tmp/test/tmp
	fallocate -l10M /tmp/test/file
	fallocate -i -o 1M -l16777203M /tmp/test/file
	fsstress -d /tmp/test -l 0 -n 100000 -p 8 &
	sleep 10 && killall -9 fsstress
	rm -f /tmp/test/tmp
	xfs_io -c "open -ad /tmp/test/file" -c "pwrite -S 0xff 0 8192"

We simply refactor the logic for adjusting the best extent by adding
a temporary ext4_free_extent ex and use extent_logical_end() to avoid
overflow, which also simplifies the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54069 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
