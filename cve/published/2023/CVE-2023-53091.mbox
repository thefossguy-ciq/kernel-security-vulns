Subject: CVE-2023-53091: ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: update s_journal_inum if it changes after journal replay

When mounting a crafted ext4 image, s_journal_inum may change after journal
replay, which is obviously unreasonable because we have successfully loaded
and replayed the journal through the old s_journal_inum. And the new
s_journal_inum bypasses some of the checks in ext4_get_journal(), which
may trigger a null pointer dereference problem. So if s_journal_inum
changes after the journal replay, we ignore the change, and rewrite the
current journal_inum to the superblock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53091 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
