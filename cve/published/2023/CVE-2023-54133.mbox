Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfp: clean mc addresses in application firmware when closing port

When moving devices from one namespace to another, mc addresses are
cleaned in software while not removed from application firmware. Thus
the mc addresses are remained and will cause resource leak.

Now use `__dev_mc_unsync` to clean mc addresses when closing port.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54133 to this issue.

	drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfp_net_common.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c427221733d49fd1e1b79b4a86746acf3ef660e7
