Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: unmap and remove csa_va properly

Root PD BO should be reserved before unmap and remove
a bo_va from VM otherwise lockdep will complain.

v2: check fpriv->csa_va is not NULL instead of amdgpu_mcbp (christian)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
