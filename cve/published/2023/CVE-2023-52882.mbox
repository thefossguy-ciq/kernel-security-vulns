Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: h6: Reparent CPUX during PLL CPUX rate change

While PLL CPUX clock rate change when CPU is running from it works in
vast majority of cases, now and then it causes instability. This leads
to system crashes and other undefined behaviour. After a lot of testing
(30+ hours) while also doing a lot of frequency switches, we can't
observe any instability issues anymore when doing reparenting to stable
clock like 24 MHz oscillator.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52882 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
