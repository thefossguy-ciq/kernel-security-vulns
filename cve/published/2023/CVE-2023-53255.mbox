Subject: CVE-2023-53255: firmware: stratix10-svc: Fix a potential resource leak in svc_create_memory_pool()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: stratix10-svc: Fix a potential resource leak in svc_create_memory_pool()

svc_create_memory_pool() is only called from stratix10_svc_drv_probe().
Most of resources in the probe are managed, but not this memremap() call.

There is also no memunmap() call in the file.

So switch to devm_memremap() to avoid a resource leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53255 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
