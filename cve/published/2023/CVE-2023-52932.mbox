Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/swapfile: add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages()

The softlockup still occurs in get_swap_pages() under memory pressure.  64
CPU cores, 64GB memory, and 28 zram devices, the disksize of each zram
device is 50MB with same priority as si.  Use the stress-ng tool to
increase memory pressure, causing the system to oom frequently.

The plist_for_each_entry_safe() loops in get_swap_pages() could reach tens
of thousands of times to find available space (extreme case:
cond_resched() is not called in scan_swap_map_slots()).  Let's add
cond_resched() into get_swap_pages() when failed to find available space
to avoid softlockup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52932 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
