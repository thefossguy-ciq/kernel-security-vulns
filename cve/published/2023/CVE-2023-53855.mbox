Subject: CVE-2023-53855: net: dsa: ocelot: call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() under rtnl_lock() on driver remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: ocelot: call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() under rtnl_lock() on driver remove

When the tagging protocol in current use is "ocelot-8021q" and we unbind
the driver, we see this splat:

$ echo '0000:00:00.2' > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind

This was somewhat not so easy to spot, because "ocelot-8021q" is not the
default tagging protocol, and thus, not everyone who tests the unbinding
path may have switched to it beforehand. The default
felix_tag_npi_teardown() does not require rtnl_lock() to be held.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53855 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/758dbcfb257e1aee0a310bae789c2af6ffe35d0f
