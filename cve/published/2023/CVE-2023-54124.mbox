Subject: CVE-2023-54124: f2fs: fix to drop all dirty pages during umount() if cp_error is set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to drop all dirty pages during umount() if cp_error is set

xfstest generic/361 reports a bug as below:

f2fs_bug_on(sbi, sbi->fsync_node_num);

kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/super.c:1627!
RIP: 0010:f2fs_put_super+0x3a8/0x3b0
Call Trace:
 generic_shutdown_super+0x8c/0x1b0
 kill_block_super+0x2b/0x60
 kill_f2fs_super+0x87/0x110

During umount(), if cp_error is set, f2fs_wait_on_all_pages() should
not stop waiting all F2FS_WB_CP_DATA pages to be writebacked, otherwise,
fsync_node_num can be non-zero after f2fs_wait_on_all_pages() causing
this bug.

In this case, to avoid deadloop in f2fs_wait_on_all_pages(), it needs
to drop all dirty pages rather than redirtying them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54124 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
