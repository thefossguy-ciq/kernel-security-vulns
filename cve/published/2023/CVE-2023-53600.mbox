Subject: CVE-2023-53600: tunnels: fix kasan splat when generating ipv4 pmtu error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tunnels: fix kasan splat when generating ipv4 pmtu error

If we try to emit an icmp error in response to a nonliner skb, we get

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ip_compute_csum+0x134/0x220
Read of size 4 at addr ffff88811c50db00 by task iperf3/1691

 [..]

ip_compute_csum() cannot deal with nonlinear skbs, so avoid it.
After this change, splat is gone and iperf3 is no longer stuck.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53600 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
