Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: mtu3: fix kernel panic at qmu transfer done irq handler

When handle qmu transfer irq, it will unlock @mtu->lock before give back
request, if another thread handle disconnect event at the same time, and
try to disable ep, it may lock @mtu->lock and free qmu ring, then qmu
irq hanlder may get a NULL gpd, avoid the KE by checking gpd's value before
handling it.

e.g.
qmu done irq on cpu0                 thread running on cpu1

qmu_done_tx()
  handle gpd [0]
    mtu3_requ_complete()        mtu3_gadget_ep_disable()
      unlock @mtu->lock
        give back request         lock @mtu->lock
                                    mtu3_ep_disable()
                                      mtu3_gpd_ring_free()
                                   unlock @mtu->lock
      lock @mtu->lock
    get next gpd [1]

[1]: goto [0] to handle next gpd, and next gpd may be NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54159 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
