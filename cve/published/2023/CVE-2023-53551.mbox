Subject: CVE-2023-53551: usb: gadget: u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: u_serial: Add null pointer check in gserial_resume

Consider a case where gserial_disconnect has already cleared
gser->ioport. And if a wakeup interrupt triggers afterwards,
gserial_resume gets called, which will lead to accessing of
gser->ioport and thus causing null pointer dereference.Add
a null pointer check to prevent this.

Added a static spinlock to prevent gser->ioport from becoming
null after the newly added check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53551 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
