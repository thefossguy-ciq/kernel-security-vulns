Subject: CVE-2023-53181: dma-buf/dma-resv: Stop leaking on krealloc() failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-buf/dma-resv: Stop leaking on krealloc() failure

Currently dma_resv_get_fences() will leak the previously
allocated array if the fence iteration got restarted and
the krealloc_array() fails.

Free the old array by hand, and make sure we still clear
the returned *fences so the caller won't end up accessing
freed memory. Some (but not all) of the callers of
dma_resv_get_fences() seem to still trawl through the
array even when dma_resv_get_fences() failed. And let's
zero out *num_fences as well for good measure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53181 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
