Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_pmem: add the missing REQ_OP_WRITE for flush bio

When doing mkfs.xfs on a pmem device, the following warning was

 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 384 at block/blk-core.c:751 submit_bio_noacct
 Modules linked in:
 CPU: 2 PID: 384 Comm: mkfs.xfs Not tainted 6.4.0-rc7+ #154
 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)
 RIP: 0010:submit_bio_noacct+0x340/0x520

 Call Trace:

  submit_bio_wait+0x5a/0xc0
  blkdev_issue_flush+0x44/0x60

The root cause is that submit_bio_noacct() needs bio_op() is either
WRITE or ZONE_APPEND for flush bio and async_pmem_flush() doesn't assign
REQ_OP_WRITE when allocating flush bio, so submit_bio_noacct just fail
the flush bio.

Simply fix it by adding the missing REQ_OP_WRITE for flush bio. And we
could fix the flush order issue and do flush optimization later.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
