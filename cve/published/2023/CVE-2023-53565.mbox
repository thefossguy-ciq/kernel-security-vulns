Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: Check for probe() id argument being NULL

The probe() id argument may be NULL in 2 scenarios:

1. brcmf_pcie_pm_leave_D3() calling brcmf_pcie_probe() to reprobe
   the device.

2. If a user tries to manually bind the driver from sysfs then the sdio /
   pcie / usb probe() function gets called with NULL as id argument.

1. Is being hit by users causing the following oops on resume and causing
wifi to stop working:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018

<snip>

Fix this by checking for id being NULL.

In the PCI and USB cases try a manual lookup of the id so that manually
binding the driver through sysfs and more importantly brcmf_pcie_probe()
on resume will work.

For the SDIO case there is no helper to do a manual sdio_device_id lookup,
so just directly error out on a NULL id there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53565 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
