Subject: CVE-2023-53528: RDMA/rxe: Fix unsafe drain work queue code

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix unsafe drain work queue code

If create_qp does not fully succeed it is possible for qp cleanup
code to attempt to drain the send or recv work queues before the
queues have been created causing a seg fault. This patch checks
to see if the queues exist before attempting to drain them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53528 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
