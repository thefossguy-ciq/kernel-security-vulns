Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: memcg: fix NULL pointer in mem_cgroup_track_foreign_dirty_slowpath()

As commit 18365225f044 ("hwpoison, memcg: forcibly uncharge LRU pages"),
hwpoison will forcibly uncharg a LRU hwpoisoned page, the folio_memcg
could be NULl, then, mem_cgroup_track_foreign_dirty_slowpath() could
occurs a NULL pointer dereference, let's do not record the foreign
writebacks for folio memcg is null in mem_cgroup_track_foreign_dirty() to
fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52939 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
