Subject: CVE-2023-53248: drm/amdgpu: install stub fence into potential unused fence pointers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: install stub fence into potential unused fence pointers

Install stub fence into these fence pointers instead of NULL
to avoid NULL dereference when calling dma_fence_wait() on them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53248 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
