Subject: CVE-2023-53603: scsi: qla2xxx: Avoid fcport pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Avoid fcport pointer dereference

Klocwork reported warning of NULL pointer may be dereferenced.  The routine
exits when sa_ctl is NULL and fcport is allocated after the exit call thus
causing NULL fcport pointer to dereference at the time of exit.

To avoid fcport pointer dereference, exit the routine when sa_ctl is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53603 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
