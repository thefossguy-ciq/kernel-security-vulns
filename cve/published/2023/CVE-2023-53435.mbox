Subject: CVE-2023-53435: cassini: Fix a memory leak in the error handling path of cas_init_one()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cassini: Fix a memory leak in the error handling path of cas_init_one()

cas_saturn_firmware_init() allocates some memory using vmalloc(). This
memory is freed in the .remove() function but not it the error handling
path of the probe.

Add the missing vfree() to avoid a memory leak, should an error occur.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53435 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
