Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: ublk: make sure that block size is set correctly

block size is one very key setting for block layer, and bad block size
could panic kernel easily.

Make sure that block size is set correctly.

Meantime if ublk_validate_params() fails, clear ub->params so that disk
is prevented from being added.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
