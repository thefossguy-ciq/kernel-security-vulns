Subject: CVE-2023-53819: amdgpu: validate offset_in_bo of drm_amdgpu_gem_va

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amdgpu: validate offset_in_bo of drm_amdgpu_gem_va

This is motivated by OOB access in amdgpu_vm_update_range when
offset_in_bo+map_size overflows.

v2: keep the validations in amdgpu_vm_bo_map
v3: add the validations to amdgpu_vm_bo_map/amdgpu_vm_bo_replace_map
    rather than to amdgpu_gem_va_ioctl

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
