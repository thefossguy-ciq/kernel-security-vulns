Subject: CVE-2023-53105: net/mlx5e: Fix cleanup null-ptr deref on encap lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix cleanup null-ptr deref on encap lock

During module is unloaded while a peer tc flow is still offloaded,
first the peer uplink rep profile is changed to a nic profile, and so
neigh encap lock is destroyed. Next during unload, the VF reps netdevs
are unregistered which causes the original non-peer tc flow to be deleted,
which deletes the peer flow. The peer flow deletion detaches the encap
entry and try to take the already destroyed encap lock, causing the
below trace.

Fix this by clearing peer flows during tc eswitch cleanup
(mlx5e_tc_esw_cleanup()).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
