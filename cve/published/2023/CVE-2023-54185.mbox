Subject: CVE-2023-54185: btrfs: remove BUG_ON()'s in add_new_free_space()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: remove BUG_ON()'s in add_new_free_space()

At add_new_free_space() we have these BUG_ON()'s that are there to deal
with any failure to add free space to the in memory free space cache.
Such failures are mostly -ENOMEM that should be very rare. However there's
no need to have these BUG_ON()'s, we can just return any error to the
caller and all callers and their upper call chain are already dealing with
errors.

So just make add_new_free_space() return any errors, while removing the
BUG_ON()'s, and returning the total amount of added free space to an
optional u64 pointer argument.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54185 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
