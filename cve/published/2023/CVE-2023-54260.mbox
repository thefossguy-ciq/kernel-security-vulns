Subject: CVE-2023-54260: cifs: Fix lost destroy smbd connection when MR allocate failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix lost destroy smbd connection when MR allocate failed

If the MR allocate failed, the smb direct connection info is NULL,
then smbd_destroy() will directly return, then the connection info
will be leaked.

Let's set the smb direct connection info to the server before call
smbd_destroy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54260 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
