Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: rk817: Fix node refcount leak

Dan Carpenter reports that the Smatch static checker warning has found
that there is another refcount leak in the probe function. While
of_node_put() was added in one of the return paths, it should in
fact be added for ALL return paths that return an error and at driver
removal time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52571 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
