Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi_tcp: Check that sock is valid before iscsi_set_param()

The validity of sock should be checked before assignment to avoid incorrect
values. Commit 57569c37f0ad ("scsi: iscsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix null-ptr-deref
while calling getpeername()") introduced this change which may lead to
inconsistent values of tcp_sw_conn->sendpage and conn->datadgst_en.

Fix the issue by moving the position of the assignment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53464 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
