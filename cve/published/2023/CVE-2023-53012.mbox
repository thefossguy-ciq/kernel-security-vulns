Subject: CVE-2023-53012: thermal: core: call put_device() only after device_register() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: core: call put_device() only after device_register() fails

put_device() shouldn't be called before a prior call to
device_register(). __thermal_cooling_device_register() doesn't follow
that properly and needs fixing. Also
thermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() is getting called unnecessarily
on few error paths.

Fix all this by placing the calls at the right place.

Based on initial work done by Caleb Connolly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53012 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
