Subject: CVE-2023-53145: Bluetooth: btsdio: fix use after free bug in btsdio_remove due to race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btsdio: fix use after free bug in btsdio_remove due to race condition

In btsdio_probe, the data->work is bound with btsdio_work. It will be
started in btsdio_send_frame.

If the btsdio_remove runs with a unfinished work, there may be a race
condition that hdev is freed but used in btsdio_work. Fix it by
canceling the work before do cleanup in btsdio_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53145 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
