Subject: CVE-2023-53151: md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes

Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing
writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many
writes can cause soft lockup.

Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for
raid10 with ramdisks:

watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#10 stuck for 27s! [md0_raid10:1293]

Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.

Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,
in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of
memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53151 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
