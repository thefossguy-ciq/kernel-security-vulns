Subject: CVE-2023-53999: net/mlx5e: TC, Fix internal port memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: TC, Fix internal port memory leak

The flow rule can be splited, and the extra post_act rules are added
to post_act table. It's possible to trigger memleak when the rule
forwards packets from internal port and over tunnel, in the case that,
for example, CT 'new' state offload is allowed. As int_port object is
assigned to the flow attribute of post_act rule, and its refcnt is
incremented by mlx5e_tc_int_port_get(), but mlx5e_tc_int_port_put() is
not called, the refcnt is never decremented, then int_port is never
freed.

The kmemleak reports the following error:
unreferenced object 0xffff888128204b80 (size 64):

So fix this by moving int_port cleanup code to the flow attribute
free helper, which is used by all the attribute free cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53999 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc1918bac0f30e3f551ef5649b53062917db55fa
