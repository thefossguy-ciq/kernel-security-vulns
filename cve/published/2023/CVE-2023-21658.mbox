Subject: CVE-2023-21658: memstick: fix memory leak if card device is never registered

Description
===========

memstick: fix memory leak if card device is never registered

When calling dev_set_name() memory is allocated for the name for the
struct device.  Once that structure device is registered, or attempted
to be registerd, with the driver core, the driver core will handle
cleaning up that memory when the device is removed from the system.

Unfortunatly for the memstick code, there is an error path that causes
the struct device to never be registered, and so the memory allocated in
dev_set_name will be leaked.  Fix that leak by manually freeing it right
before the memory for the device is freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-21658 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual change to resolve this
issue can be found at:
