Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: imx: scu: use _safe list iterator to avoid a use after free

This loop is freeing "clk" so it needs to use list_for_each_entry_safe().
Otherwise it dereferences a freed variable to get the next item on the
loop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53572 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
