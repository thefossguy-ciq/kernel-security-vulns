Subject: CVE-2023-53010: bnxt: Do not read past the end of test names

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt: Do not read past the end of test names

Test names were being concatenated based on a offset beyond the end of
the first name, which tripped the buffer overflow detection logic:

 detected buffer overflow in strnlen
 [...]
 Call Trace:
 bnxt_ethtool_init.cold+0x18/0x18

Refactor struct hwrm_selftest_qlist_output to use an actual array,
and adjust the concatenation to use snprintf() rather than a series of
strncat() calls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53010 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
