Subject: CVE-2023-54181: bpf: Fix issue in verifying allow_ptr_leaks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix issue in verifying allow_ptr_leaks

After we converted the capabilities of our networking-bpf program from
cap_sys_admin to cap_net_admin+cap_bpf, our networking-bpf program
failed to start. Because it failed the bpf verifier, and the error log
is "R3 pointer comparison prohibited".

A simple reproducer as follows,

SEC("cls-ingress")
int ingress(struct __sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct iphdr *iph = (void *)(long)skb->data + sizeof(struct ethhdr);

	if ((long)(iph + 1) > (long)skb->data_end)
		return TC_ACT_STOLEN;
	return TC_ACT_OK;
}

Per discussion with Yonghong and Alexei [1], comparison of two packet
pointers is not a pointer leak. This patch fixes it.

Our local kernel is 6.1.y and we expect this fix to be backported to
6.1.y, so stable is CCed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
