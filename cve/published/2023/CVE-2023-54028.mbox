Subject: CVE-2023-54028: RDMA/rxe: Fix the error "trying to register non-static key in rxe_cleanup_task"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix the error "trying to register non-static key in rxe_cleanup_task"

In the function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to
initialize qp, internally things like rxe_init_task are not setup until
rxe_qp_init_req().

If an error occurred before this point then the unwind will call
rxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()
which will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.

If rxe_init_task is not executed, rxe_cleanup_task will not be called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54028 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
