Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ov2740: Fix memleak in ov2740_init_controls()

There is a kmemleak when testing the media/i2c/ov2740.c with bpf mock
device:

unreferenced object 0xffff8881090e19e0 (size 16):

ov2740_init_controls() won't clean all the allocated resources in fail
path, which may causes the memleaks. Add v4l2_ctrl_handler_free() to
prevent memleak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53349 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
