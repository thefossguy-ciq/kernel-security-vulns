Subject: CVE-2023-54194: exfat: use kvmalloc_array/kvfree instead of kmalloc_array/kfree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: use kvmalloc_array/kvfree instead of kmalloc_array/kfree

The call stack shown below is a scenario in the Linux 4.19 kernel.
Allocating memory failed where exfat fs use kmalloc_array due to
system memory fragmentation, while the u-disk was inserted without
recognition.
Devices such as u-disk using the exfat file system are pluggable and
may be insert into the system at any time.
However, long-term running systems cannot guarantee the continuity of
physical memory. Therefore, it's necessary to address this issue.

Binder:2632_6: page allocation failure: order:4,
 mode:0x6040c0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_COMP), nodemask=(null)

By analyzing the exfat code,we found that continuous physical memory
is not required here,so kvmalloc_array is used can solve this problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54194 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
