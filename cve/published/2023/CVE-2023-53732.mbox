Subject: CVE-2023-53732: fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL dereference in ni_write_inode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL dereference in ni_write_inode

Syzbot reports a NULL dereference in ni_write_inode.
When creating a new inode, if allocation fails in mi_init function
(called in mi_format_new function), mi->mrec is set to NULL.
In the error path of this inode creation, mi->mrec is later
dereferenced in ni_write_inode.

Add a NULL check to prevent NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53732 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
