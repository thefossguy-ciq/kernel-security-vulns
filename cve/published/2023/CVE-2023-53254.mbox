Subject: CVE-2023-53254: cacheinfo: Fix shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cacheinfo: Fix shared_cpu_map to handle shared caches at different levels

The cacheinfo sets up the shared_cpu_map by checking whether the caches
with the same index are shared between CPUs. However, this will trigger
slab-out-of-bounds access if the CPUs do not have the same cache hierarchy.
Another problem is the mismatched shared_cpu_map when the shared cache does
not have the same index between CPUs.

CPU0	I	D	L3
index	0	1	2	x
	^	^	^	^
index	0	1	2	3
CPU1	I	D	L2	L3

This patch checks each cache is shared with all caches on other CPUs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53254 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
