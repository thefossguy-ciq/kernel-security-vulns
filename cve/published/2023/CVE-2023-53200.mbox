Subject: CVE-2023-53200: netfilter: x_tables: fix percpu counter block leak on error path when creating new netns

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: x_tables: fix percpu counter block leak on error path when creating new netns

Here is the stack where we allocate percpu counter block:

  +-< __alloc_percpu
    +-< xt_percpu_counter_alloc
      +-< find_check_entry # {arp,ip,ip6}_tables.c
        +-< translate_table

And it can be leaked on this code path:

  +-> ip6t_register_table
    +-> translate_table # allocates percpu counter block
    +-> xt_register_table # fails

there is no freeing of the counter block on xt_register_table fail.
Note: xt_percpu_counter_free should be called to free it like we do in
do_replace through cleanup_entry helper (or in __ip6t_unregister_table).

Probability of hitting this error path is low AFAICS (xt_register_table
can only return ENOMEM here, as it is not replacing anything, as we are
creating new netns, and it is hard to imagine that all previous
allocations succeeded and after that one in xt_register_table failed).
But it's worth fixing even the rare leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53200 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
