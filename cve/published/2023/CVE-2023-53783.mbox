Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-iocost: fix divide by 0 error in calc_lcoefs()

echo max of u64 to cost.model can cause divide by 0 error.

  # echo 8:0 rbps=18446744073709551615 > /sys/fs/cgroup/io.cost.model

  divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
  RIP: 0010:calc_lcoefs+0x4c/0xc0
  Call Trace:

calc_lcoefs() uses the input value of cost.model in DIV_ROUND_UP_ULL,
overflow would happen if bps plus IOC_PAGE_SIZE is greater than
ULLONG_MAX, it can cause divide by 0 error.

Fix the problem by setting basecost

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53783 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
