Subject: CVE-2023-53495: net: ethernet: mvpp2_main: fix possible OOB write in mvpp2_ethtool_get_rxnfc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mvpp2_main: fix possible OOB write in mvpp2_ethtool_get_rxnfc()

rules is allocated in ethtool_get_rxnfc and the size is determined by
rule_cnt from user space. So rule_cnt needs to be check before using
rules to avoid OOB writing or NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53495 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
