Subject: CVE-2023-53589: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't trust firmware n_channels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't trust firmware n_channels

If the firmware sends us a corrupted MCC response with
n_channels much larger than the command response can be,
we might copy far too much (uninitialized) memory and
even crash if the n_channels is large enough to make it
run out of the one page allocated for the FW response.

Fix that by checking the lengths. Doing a < comparison
would be sufficient, but the firmware should be doing
it correctly, so check more strictly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53589 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
