Subject: CVE-2023-53303: net: microchip: vcap api: Fix possible memory leak for vcap_dup_rule()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: microchip: vcap api: Fix possible memory leak for vcap_dup_rule()

Inject fault When select CONFIG_VCAP_KUNIT_TEST, the below memory leak
occurs. If kzalloc() for duprule succeeds, but the following
kmemdup() fails, the duprule, ckf and caf memory will be leaked. So kfree
them in the error path.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a26ba60413b2c8f95daf0ee0152cf82abd7bfbe4
