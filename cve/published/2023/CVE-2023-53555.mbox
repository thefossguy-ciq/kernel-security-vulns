Subject: CVE-2023-53555: mm/damon/core: initialize damo_filter->list from damos_new_filter()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/core: initialize damo_filter->list from damos_new_filter()

damos_new_filter() is not initializing the list field of newly allocated
filter object.  However, DAMON sysfs interface and DAMON_RECLAIM are not
initializing it after calling damos_new_filter().  As a result, accessing
uninitialized memory is possible.  Actually, adding multiple DAMOS filters
via DAMON sysfs interface caused NULL pointer dereferencing.  Initialize
the field just after the allocation from damos_new_filter().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53555 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
