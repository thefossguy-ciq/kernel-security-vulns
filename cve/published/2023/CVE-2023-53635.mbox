Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: fix wrong ct->timeout value

(struct nf_conn)->timeout is an interval before the conntrack
confirmed.  After confirmed, it becomes a timestamp.

It is observed that timeout of an unconfirmed conntrack:
- Set by calling ctnetlink_change_timeout(). As a result,
  `nfct_time_stamp` was wrongly added to `ct->timeout` twice.
- Get by calling ctnetlink_dump_timeout(). As a result,
  `nfct_time_stamp` was wrongly subtracted.

Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 dump_stack_lvl
 ctnetlink_dump_timeout
 __ctnetlink_glue_build
 ctnetlink_glue_build
 __nfqnl_enqueue_packet
 nf_queue
 nf_hook_slow
 ip_mc_output
 ? __pfx_ip_finish_output
 ip_send_skb
 ? __pfx_dst_output
 udp_send_skb
 udp_sendmsg
 ? __pfx_ip_generic_getfrag
 sock_sendmsg

Separate the 2 cases in:
- Setting `ct->timeout` in __nf_ct_set_timeout().
- Getting `ct->timeout` in ctnetlink_dump_timeout().

Pablo appends:

Update ctnetlink to set up the timeout _after_ the IPS_CONFIRMED flag is
set on, otherwise conntrack creation via ctnetlink breaks.

Note that the problem described in this patch occurs since the
introduction of the nfnetlink_queue conntrack support, select a
sufficiently old Fixes: tag for -stable kernel to pick up this fix.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53635 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
