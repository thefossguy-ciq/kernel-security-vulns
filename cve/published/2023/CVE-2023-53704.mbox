Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: imx: clk-imx8mp: improve error handling in imx8mp_clocks_probe()

Replace of_iomap() and kzalloc() with devm_of_iomap() and devm_kzalloc()
which can automatically release the related memory when the device
or driver is removed or unloaded to avoid potential memory leak.

In this case, iounmap(anatop_base) in line 427,433 are removed
as manual release is not required.

Besides, referring to clk-imx8mq.c, check the return code of
of_clk_add_hw_provider, if it returns negtive, print error info
and unregister hws, which makes the program more robust.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53704 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
