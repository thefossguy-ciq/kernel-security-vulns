Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mana: Fix TX CQE error handling

For an unknown TX CQE error type (probably from a newer hardware),
still free the SKB, update the queue tail, etc., otherwise the
accounting will be wrong.

Also, TX errors can be triggered by injecting corrupted packets, so
replace the WARN_ONCE to ratelimited error logging.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52532 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
