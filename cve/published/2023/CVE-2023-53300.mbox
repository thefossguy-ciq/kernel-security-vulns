Subject: CVE-2023-53300: media: hi846: Fix memleak in hi846_init_controls()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: hi846: Fix memleak in hi846_init_controls()

hi846_init_controls doesn't clean the allocated ctrl_hdlr
in case there is a failure, which causes memleak. Add
v4l2_ctrl_handler_free to free the resource properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53300 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
