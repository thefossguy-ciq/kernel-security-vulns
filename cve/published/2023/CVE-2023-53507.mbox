Subject: CVE-2023-53507: net/mlx5: Unregister devlink params in case interface is down

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Unregister devlink params in case interface is down

Currently, in case an interface is down, mlx5 driver doesn't
unregister its devlink params, which leads to this WARN[1].
Fix it by unregistering devlink params in that case as well.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/471f59b3455314f0cafacf3096453727876355a9
