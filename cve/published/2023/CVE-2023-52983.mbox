Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix uaf for bfqq in bic_set_bfqq()

After commit 64dc8c732f5c ("block, bfq: fix possible uaf for 'bfqq->bic'"),
bic->bfqq will be accessed in bic_set_bfqq(), however, in some context
bic->bfqq will be freed, and bic_set_bfqq() is called with the freed
bic->bfqq.

Fix the problem by always freeing bfqq after bic_set_bfqq().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52983 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
