Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: Fix integer overflow in radeon_cs_parser_init

The type of size is unsigned, if size is 0x40000000, there will be an
integer overflow, size will be zero after size *= sizeof(uint32_t),
will cause uninitialized memory to be referenced later

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53309 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
