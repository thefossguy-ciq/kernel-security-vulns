Subject: CVE-2023-53039: HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix potential use-after-free in work function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Fix potential use-after-free in work function

When a reset notify IPC message is received, the ISR schedules a work
function and passes the ISHTP device to it via a global pointer
ishtp_dev. If ish_probe() fails, the devm-managed device resources
including ishtp_dev are freed, but the work is not cancelled, causing a
use-after-free when the work function tries to access ishtp_dev. Use
devm_work_autocancel() instead, so that the work is automatically
cancelled if probe fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
