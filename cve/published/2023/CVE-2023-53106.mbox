Subject: CVE-2023-53106: nfc: st-nci: Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: st-nci: Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition

This bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove and st_nci_spi_remove.
Take st_nci_i2c_remove as an example.

In st_nci_i2c_probe, it called ndlc_probe and bound &ndlc->sm_work
with llt_ndlc_sm_work.

When it calls ndlc_recv or timeout handler, it will finally call
schedule_work to start the work.

When we call st_nci_i2c_remove to remove the driver, there
may be a sequence as follows:

Fix it by finishing the work before cleanup in ndlc_remove

CPU0                  CPU1

                    |llt_ndlc_sm_work
st_nci_i2c_remove   |
  ndlc_remove       |
     st_nci_remove  |
     nci_free_device|
     kfree(ndev)    |
//free ndlc->ndev   |
                    |llt_ndlc_rcv_queue
                    |nci_recv_frame
                    |//use ndlc->ndev

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
