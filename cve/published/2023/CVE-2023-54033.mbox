Subject: CVE-2023-54033: bpf: fix a memory leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix a memory leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps

The LRU and LRU_PERCPU maps allocate a new element on update before locking the
target hash table bucket. Right after that the maps try to lock the bucket.
If this fails, then maps return -EBUSY to the caller without releasing the
allocated element. This makes the element untracked: it doesn't belong to
either of free lists, and it doesn't belong to the hash table, so can't be
re-used; this eventually leads to the permanent -ENOMEM on LRU map updates,
which is unexpected. Fix this by returning the element to the local free list
if bucket locking fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54033 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
