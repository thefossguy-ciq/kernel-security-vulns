Subject: CVE-2023-54318: net/smc: use smc_lgr_list.lock to protect smc_lgr_list.list iterate in smcr_port_add

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: use smc_lgr_list.lock to protect smc_lgr_list.list iterate in smcr_port_add

While doing smcr_port_add, there maybe linkgroup add into or delete
from smc_lgr_list.list at the same time, which may result kernel crash.
So, use smc_lgr_list.lock to protect smc_lgr_list.list iterate in
smcr_port_add.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
