Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: fix potential kgd_mem UAFs

kgd_mem pointers returned by kfd_process_device_translate_handle are
only guaranteed to be valid while p->mutex is held. As soon as the mutex
is unlocked, another thread can free the BO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53816 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.23 with commit 5045360f3bb62ccd4f87202e33489f71f8bbc3fc

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_chardev.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
