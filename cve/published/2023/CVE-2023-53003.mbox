Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/qcom: Do not pass llcc_driv_data as edac_device_ctl_info's pvt_info

The memory for llcc_driv_data is allocated by the LLCC driver. But when
it is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC core, it will get freed
during the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver gets probed
again, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug.

Hence, do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it
using the platform_data pointer in the qcom_edac driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53003 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
