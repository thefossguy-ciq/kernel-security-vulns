Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: r8712: Fix memory leak in _r8712_init_xmit_priv()

In the above mentioned routine, memory is allocated in several places.
If the first succeeds and a later one fails, the routine will leak memory.
This patch fixes commit 2865d42c78a9 ("staging: r8712u: Add the new driver
to the mainline kernel"). A potential memory leak in
r8712_xmit_resource_alloc() is also addressed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
