Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-pf: Avoid use of GFP_KERNEL in atomic context

Using GFP_KERNEL in preemption disable context, causing below warning
when CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is enabled.

[   32.542271] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched/mm.h:274

To avoid use of GFP_ATOMIC for memory allocation, disable preemption
after all memory allocation is done.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
