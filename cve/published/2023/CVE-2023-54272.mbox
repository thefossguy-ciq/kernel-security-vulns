Subject: CVE-2023-54272: fs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()

In a previous commit c1006bd13146, ni->mi.mrec in ni_write_inode()
could be NULL, and thus a NULL check is added for this variable.

However, in the same call stack, ni->mi.mrec can be also dereferenced
in ni_clear():

ntfs_evict_inode(inode)
  ni_write_inode(inode, ...)
    ni = ntfs_i(inode);
    is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> Add a NULL check by previous commit
  ni_clear(ntfs_i(inode))
    is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> No check

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may exist in ni_clear().
To fix it, a NULL check is added in this function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54272 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
