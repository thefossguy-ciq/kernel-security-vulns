Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: ep: Only send -ENOTCONN status if client driver is available

For the STOP and RESET commands, only send the channel disconnect status
-ENOTCONN if client driver is available. Otherwise, it will result in
null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54249 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
