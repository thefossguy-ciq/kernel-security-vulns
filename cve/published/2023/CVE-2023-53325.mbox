Subject: CVE-2023-53325: drm/mediatek: dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: dp: Change logging to dev for mtk_dp_aux_transfer()

Change logging from drm_{err,info}() to dev_{err,info}() in functions
mtk_dp_aux_transfer() and mtk_dp_aux_do_transfer(): this will be
essential to avoid getting NULL pointer kernel panics if any kind
of error happens during AUX transfers happening before the bridge
is attached.

This may potentially start happening in a later commit implementing
aux-bus support, as AUX transfers will be triggered from the panel
driver (for EDID) before the mtk-dp bridge gets attached, and it's
done in preparation for the same.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53325 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
