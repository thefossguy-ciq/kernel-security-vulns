Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Fix OOB read in indx_insert_into_buffer

Syzbot reported a OOB read bug:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in indx_insert_into_buffer+0xaa3/0x13b0
fs/ntfs3/index.c:1755
Read of size 17168 at addr ffff8880255e06c0 by task syz-executor308/3630

Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 memmove+0x25/0x60 mm/kasan/shadow.c:54
 indx_insert_into_buffer+0xaa3/0x13b0 fs/ntfs3/index.c:1755
 indx_insert_entry+0x446/0x6b0 fs/ntfs3/index.c:1863
 ntfs_create_inode+0x1d3f/0x35c0 fs/ntfs3/inode.c:1548
 ntfs_create+0x3e/0x60 fs/ntfs3/namei.c:100
 lookup_open fs/namei.c:3413 [inline]

If the member struct INDEX_BUFFER *index of struct indx_node is
incorrect, that is, the value of __le32 used is greater than the value
of __le32 total in struct INDEX_HDR. Therefore, OOB read occurs when
memmove is called in indx_insert_into_buffer().
Fix this by adding a check in hdr_find_e().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
