Subject: CVE-2023-54008: virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_vdpa: build affinity masks conditionally

We try to build affinity mask via create_affinity_masks()
unconditionally which may lead several issues:

- the affinity mask is not used for parent without affinity support
  (only VDUSE support the affinity now)
- the logic of create_affinity_masks() might not work for devices
  other than block. For example it's not rare in the networking device
  where the number of queues could exceed the number of CPUs. Such
  case breaks the current affinity logic which is based on
  group_cpus_evenly() who assumes the number of CPUs are not less than
  the number of groups. This can trigger a warning[1]:

	if (ret >= 0)
		WARN_ON(nr_present + nr_others < numgrps);

Fixing this by only build the affinity masks only when

- Driver passes affinity descriptor, driver like virtio-blk can make
  sure to limit the number of queues when it exceeds the number of CPUs
- Parent support affinity setting config ops

This help to avoid the warning. More optimizations could be done on
top.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
