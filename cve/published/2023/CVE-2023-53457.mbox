Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

FS: JFS: Fix null-ptr-deref Read in txBegin

 Syzkaller reported an issue where txBegin may be called
 on a superblock in a read-only mounted filesystem which leads
 to NULL pointer deref. This could be solved by checking if
 the filesystem is read-only before calling txBegin, and returning
 with appropiate error code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53457 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
