Subject: CVE-2023-53529: wifi: rtw88: Fix memory leak in rtw88_usb

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: Fix memory leak in rtw88_usb

Kmemleak shows the following leak arising from routine in the usb
probe routine:

unreferenced object 0xffff895cb29bba00 (size 512):

The leak was verified to be real by unloading the driver, which resulted
in a dangling pointer to the allocation.

The allocated memory is freed in rtw_usb_intf_deinit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53529 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5bba1ad561a8b5bb14704d8f511cf10466336e3d
