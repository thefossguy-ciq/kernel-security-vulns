Subject: CVE-2023-54151: f2fs: Fix system crash due to lack of free space in LFS

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: Fix system crash due to lack of free space in LFS

When f2fs tries to checkpoint during foreground gc in LFS mode, system
crash occurs due to lack of free space if the amount of dirty node and
dentry pages generated by data migration exceeds free space.
The reproduction sequence is as follows.

 - 20GiB capacity block device (null_blk)
 - format and mount with LFS mode
 - create a file and write 20,000MiB
 - 4k random write on full range of the file

 RIP: 0010:new_curseg+0x48a/0x510 [f2fs]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
