Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: Fix deadlock during directory rename

As lockdep properly warns, we should not be locking i_rwsem while having
transactions started as the proper lock ordering used by all directory
handling operations is i_rwsem -> transaction start. Fix the lock
ordering by moving the locking of the directory earlier in
ext4_rename().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53129 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue fixed in mainline with commit 3c92792

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53129
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/ext4/namei.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
