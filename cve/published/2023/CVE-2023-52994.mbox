Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acpi: Fix suspend with Xen PV

Commit f1e525009493 ("x86/boot: Skip realmode init code when running as
Xen PV guest") missed one code path accessing real_mode_header, leading
to dereferencing NULL when suspending the system under Xen:

Fix that by adding an optional acpi callback allowing to skip setting
the wakeup address, as in the Xen PV case this will be handled by the
hypervisor anyway.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52994 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/x86/include/asm/acpi.h
	drivers/acpi/sleep.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b96903b7fc8c82ddfd92df4cdd83db3e567da0a5
