Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: fix memory leak after finding block group with super blocks

At exclude_super_stripes(), if we happen to find a block group that has
super blocks mapped to it and we are on a zoned filesystem, we error out
as this is not supposed to happen, indicating either a bug or maybe some
memory corruption for example. However we are exiting the function without
freeing the memory allocated for the logical address of the super blocks.
Fix this by freeing the logical address.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54297 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
