Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: check for null return of devm_kzalloc() in dpu_writeback_init()

Because of the possilble failure of devm_kzalloc(), dpu_wb_conn might
be NULL and will cause null pointer dereference later.

Therefore, it might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
