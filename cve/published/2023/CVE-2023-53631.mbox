Subject: CVE-2023-53631: platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak

If a duplicate attribute is found using kset_find_obj(),
a reference to that attribute is returned. This means
that we need to dispose it accordingly. Use kobject_put()
to dispose the duplicate attribute in such a case.

Compile-tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53631 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
