Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-cgroup: hold queue_lock when removing blkg->q_node

When blkg is removed from q->blkg_list from blkg_free_workfn(), queue_lock
has to be held, otherwise, all kinds of bugs(list corruption, hard lockup,
..) can be triggered from blkg_destroy_all().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54088 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
