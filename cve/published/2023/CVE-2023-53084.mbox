Subject: CVE-2023-53084: drm/shmem-helper: Remove another errant put in error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/shmem-helper: Remove another errant put in error path

drm_gem_shmem_mmap() doesn't own reference in error code path, resulting
in the dma-buf shmem GEM object getting prematurely freed leading to a
later use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
