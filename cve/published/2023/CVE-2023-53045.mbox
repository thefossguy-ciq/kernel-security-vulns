Subject: CVE-2023-53045: usb: gadget: u_audio: don't let userspace block driver unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: u_audio: don't let userspace block driver unbind

In the unbind callback for f_uac1 and f_uac2, a call to snd_card_free()
via g_audio_cleanup() will disconnect the card and then wait for all
resources to be released, which happens when the refcount falls to zero.
Since userspace can keep the refcount incremented by not closing the
relevant file descriptor, the call to unbind may block indefinitely.
This can cause a deadlock during reboot, as evidenced by the following
blocked task observed on my machine:

  task:reboot  state:D stack:0   pid:2827  ppid:569    flags:0x0000000c
  Call trace:
   __switch_to+0xc8/0x140

   __do_sys_reboot+0xcc/0x1ec
   __arm64_sys_reboot+0x28/0x30
   invoke_syscall+0x4c/0x110
   ...

The issue can also be observed by opening the card with arecord and
then stopping the process through the shell before unbinding:

  # arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget -f S32_LE -c 2 -r 48000 /dev/null
  Recording WAVE '/dev/null' : Signed 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Stereo
  ^Z[1]+  Stopped                    arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget -f S32_LE -c 2 -r 48000 /dev/null
  # echo gadget.0 > /sys/bus/gadget/drivers/configfs-gadget/unbind
  (observe that the unbind command never finishes)

Fix the problem by using snd_card_free_when_closed() instead, which will
still disconnect the card as desired, but defer the task of freeing the
resources to the core once userspace closes its file descriptor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
