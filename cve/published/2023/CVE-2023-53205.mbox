Subject: CVE-2023-53205: KVM: s390/diag: fix racy access of physical cpu number in diag 9c handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: s390/diag: fix racy access of physical cpu number in diag 9c handler

We do check for target CPU == -1, but this might change at the time we
are going to use it. Hold the physical target CPU in a local variable to
avoid out-of-bound accesses to the cpu arrays.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53205 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
