Subject: CVE-2023-53055: fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscrypt: destroy keyring after security_sb_delete()

fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be called after all potentially-encrypted
inodes were evicted; otherwise it cannot safely destroy the keyring.
Since inodes that are in-use by the Landlock LSM don't get evicted until
security_sb_delete(), this means that fscrypt_destroy_keyring() must be
called *after* security_sb_delete().

This fixes a WARN_ON followed by a NULL dereference, only possible if
Landlock was being used on encrypted files.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
