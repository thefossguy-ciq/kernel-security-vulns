Subject: CVE-2023-54268: debugobjects: Don't wake up kswapd from fill_pool()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

debugobjects: Don't wake up kswapd from fill_pool()

syzbot is reporting a lockdep warning in fill_pool() because the allocation
from debugobjects is using GFP_ATOMIC, which is (__GFP_HIGH | __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM)
and therefore tries to wake up kswapd, which acquires kswapd_wait::lock.

Since fill_pool() might be called with arbitrary locks held, fill_pool()
should not assume that acquiring kswapd_wait::lock is safe.

Use __GFP_HIGH instead and remove __GFP_NORETRY as it is pointless for
!__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54268 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
