Subject: CVE-2023-53845: nilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()

If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block
address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,
nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as
-ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.

This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing
it to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.

In particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,
semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.

Fix this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block
address translation failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead
of returning the error code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53845 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
