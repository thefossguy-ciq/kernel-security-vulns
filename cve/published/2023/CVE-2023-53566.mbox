Subject: CVE-2023-53566: netfilter: nft_set_rbtree: fix null deref on element insertion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_rbtree: fix null deref on element insertion

There is no guarantee that rb_prev() will not return NULL in nft_rbtree_gc_elem():

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000003: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000018-0x000000000000001f]
 nft_add_set_elem+0x14b0/0x2990
  nf_tables_newsetelem+0x528/0xb30

Furthermore, there is a possible use-after-free while iterating,
'node' can be free'd so we need to cache the next value to use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53566 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
