Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: core: remove unnecessary frame_sz check in bpf_xdp_adjust_tail()

Syzkaller reported the following issue:

xdp->frame_sz > PAGE_SIZE check was introduced in commit c8741e2bfe87
("xdp: Allow bpf_xdp_adjust_tail() to grow packet size"). But Jesper
Dangaard Brouer <jbrouer@redhat.com> noted that after introducing the
xdp_init_buff() which all XDP driver use - it's safe to remove this
check. The original intend was to catch cases where XDP drivers have
not been updated to use xdp.frame_sz, but that is not longer a concern
(since xdp_init_buff).

Running the initial syzkaller repro it was discovered that the
contiguous physical memory allocation is used for both xdp paths in
tun_get_user(), e.g. tun_build_skb() and tun_alloc_skb(). It was also
stated by Jesper Dangaard Brouer <jbrouer@redhat.com> that XDP can
work on higher order pages, as long as this is contiguous physical
memory (e.g. a page).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54155 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
