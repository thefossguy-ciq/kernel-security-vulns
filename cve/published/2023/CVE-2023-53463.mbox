Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ibmvnic: Do not reset dql stats on NON_FATAL err

All ibmvnic resets, make a call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when
re-opening the device. netdev_tx_reset_queue() resets the num_queued
and num_completed byte counters. These stats are used in Byte Queue
Limit (BQL) algorithms. The difference between these two stats tracks
the number of bytes currently sitting on the physical NIC. ibmvnic
increases the number of queued bytes though calls to
netdev_tx_sent_queue() in the drivers xmit function. When, VIOS reports
that it is done transmitting bytes, the ibmvnic device increases the
number of completed bytes through calls to netdev_tx_completed_queue().
It is important to note that the driver batches its transmit calls and
num_queued is increased every time that an skb is added to the next
batch, not necessarily when the batch is sent to VIOS for transmission.

Unlike other reset types, a NON FATAL reset will not flush the sub crq
tx buffers. Therefore, it is possible for the batched skb array to be
partially full. So if there is call to netdev_tx_reset_queue() when
re-opening the device, the value of num_queued (0) would not account
for the skb's that are currently batched. Eventually, when the batch
is sent to VIOS, the call to netdev_tx_completed_queue() would increase
num_completed to a value greater than the num_queued. This causes a
BUG_ON crash:

Therefore, do not reset the dql stats when performing a NON_FATAL reset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53463 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
