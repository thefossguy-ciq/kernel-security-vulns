Subject: CVE-2023-53637: media: i2c: ov772x: Fix memleak in ov772x_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: i2c: ov772x: Fix memleak in ov772x_probe()

A memory leak was reported when testing ov772x with bpf mock device:

    [<0000000070baf34f>] of_i2c_register_device+0xf1/0x110

The reason is that if priv->hdl.error is set, ov772x_probe() jumps to the
error_mutex_destroy without doing v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(), and all
resources allocated in v4l2_ctrl_handler_init() and v4l2_ctrl_new_std()
are leaked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53637 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
