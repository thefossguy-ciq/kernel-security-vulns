Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: check for station first in client probe

When probing a client, first check if we have it, and then
check for the channel context, otherwise you can trigger
the warning there easily by probing when the AP isn't even
started yet. Since a client existing means the AP is also
operating, we can then keep the warning.

Also simplify the moved code a bit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53588 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e1cda5cf07f848e6b50b4e5e7761ffbce905a3d
