Subject: CVE-2023-53015: HID: betop: check shape of output reports

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: betop: check shape of output reports

betopff_init() only checks the total sum of the report counts for each
report field to be at least 4, but hid_betopff_play() expects 4 report
fields.
A device advertising an output report with one field and 4 report counts
would pass the check but crash the kernel with a NULL pointer dereference
in hid_betopff_play().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
