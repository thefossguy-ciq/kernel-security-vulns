Subject: CVE-2023-53090: drm/amdkfd: Fix an illegal memory access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix an illegal memory access

In the kfd_wait_on_events() function, the kfd_event_waiter structure is
allocated by alloc_event_waiters(), but the event field of the waiter
structure is not initialized; When copy_from_user() fails in the
kfd_wait_on_events() function, it will enter exception handling to
release the previously allocated memory of the waiter structure;
Due to the event field of the waiters structure being accessed
in the free_waiters() function, this results in illegal memory access
and system crash, here is the crash log:

Allocate the structure with kcalloc, and remove redundant 0-initialization
and a redundant loop condition check.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
