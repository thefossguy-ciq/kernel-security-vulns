Subject: CVE-2023-54101: driver: soc: xilinx: use _safe loop iterator to avoid a use after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver: soc: xilinx: use _safe loop iterator to avoid a use after free

The hash_for_each_possible() loop dereferences "eve_data" to get the
next item on the list.  However the loop frees eve_data so it leads to
a use after free.  Use hash_for_each_possible_safe() instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
