Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: EC: Fix oops when removing custom query handlers

When removing custom query handlers, the handler might still
be used inside the EC query workqueue, causing a kernel oops
if the module holding the callback function was already unloaded.

Fix this by flushing the EC query workqueue when removing
custom query handlers.

Tested on a Acer Travelmate 4002WLMi

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54244 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
