Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fail to start device if queue setup is interrupted

In ublk_ctrl_start_dev(), if wait_for_completion_interruptible() is
interrupted by signal, queues aren't setup successfully yet, so we
have to fail UBLK_CMD_START_DEV, otherwise kernel oops can be triggered.

Reported by German when working on qemu-storage-deamon which requires
single thread ublk daemon.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53508 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d5916c439574b18a0734872daa0022b3d6105ad
