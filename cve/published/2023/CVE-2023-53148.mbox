Subject: CVE-2023-53148: igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal

In a setup where a Thunderbolt hub connects to Ethernet and a display
through USB Type-C, users may experience a hung task timeout when they
remove the cable between the PC and the Thunderbolt hub.
This is because the igb_down function is called multiple times when
the Thunderbolt hub is unplugged. For example, the igb_io_error_detected
triggers the first call, and the igb_remove triggers the second call.
The second call to igb_down will block at napi_synchronize.
Here's the call trace:

    ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30

In this case, igb_io_error_detected detaches the network interface
and requests a PCIE slot reset, however, the PCIE reset callback is
not being invoked and thus the Ethernet connection breaks down.
As the PCIE error in this case is a non-fatal one, requesting a
slot reset can be avoided.
This patch fixes the task hung issue and preserves Ethernet
connection by ignoring non-fatal PCIE errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53148 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
