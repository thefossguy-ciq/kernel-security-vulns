Subject: CVE-2023-53163: fs/ntfs3: don't hold ni_lock when calling truncate_setsize()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: don't hold ni_lock when calling truncate_setsize()

syzbot is reporting hung task at do_user_addr_fault() [1], for there is
a silent deadlock between PG_locked bit and ni_lock lock.

Since filemap_update_page() calls filemap_read_folio() after calling
folio_trylock() which will set PG_locked bit, ntfs_truncate() must not
call truncate_setsize() which will wait for PG_locked bit to be cleared
when holding ni_lock lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53163 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
