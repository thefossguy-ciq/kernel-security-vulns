Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: fix tags leak when shrink nr_hw_queues

Although we don't need to realloc set->tags[] when shrink nr_hw_queues,
we need to free them. Or these tags will be leaked.

How to reproduce:
1. mount -t configfs configfs /mnt
2. modprobe null_blk nr_devices=0 submit_queues=8
3. mkdir /mnt/nullb/nullb0
4. echo 1 > /mnt/nullb/nullb0/power
5. echo 4 > /mnt/nullb/nullb0/submit_queues
6. rmdir /mnt/nullb/nullb0

In step 4, will alloc 9 tags (8 submit queues and 1 poll queue), then
in step 5, new_nr_hw_queues = 5 (4 submit queues and 1 poll queue).
At last in step 6, only these 5 tags are freed, the other 4 tags leaked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0ef7493e68b8896806a2f598fcffbaa97333405
