Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: microchip: fix potential UAF in auxdev release callback

Similar to commit 1c11289b34ab ("peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in
adev_release()"), the auxiliary device is not torn down in the correct
order. If auxiliary_device_add() fails, the release callback will be
called twice, resulting in a UAF. Due to timing, the auxdev code in this
driver "took inspiration" from the aforementioned commit, and thus its
bugs too!

Moving auxiliary_device_uninit() to the unregister callback instead
avoids the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53636 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
