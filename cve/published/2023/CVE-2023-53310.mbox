Subject: CVE-2023-53310: power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Fix external_power_changed race

fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() dereferences info->bat,
which gets sets in axp288_fuel_gauge_probe() like this:

  info->bat = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &fuel_gauge_desc, &psy_cfg);

As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
where fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() may get called while
info->bat has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
the power_supply which will eventually get stored in info->bat,
so fuel_gauge_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
the passed in psy argument which is always valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53310 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
