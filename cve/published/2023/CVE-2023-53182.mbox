Subject: CVE-2023-53182: ACPICA: Avoid undefined behavior: applying zero offset to null pointer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: Avoid undefined behavior: applying zero offset to null pointer

ACPICA commit 770653e3ba67c30a629ca7d12e352d83c2541b1e

Before this change we see the following UBSAN stack trace in Fuchsia:

Add a simple check that avoids incrementing a pointer by zero, but
otherwise behaves as before. Note that our findings are against ACPICA
20221020, but the same code exists on master.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53182 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
