Subject: CVE-2023-53189: ipv6/addrconf: fix a potential refcount underflow for idev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6/addrconf: fix a potential refcount underflow for idev

Now in addrconf_mod_rs_timer(), reference idev depends on whether
rs_timer is not pending. Then modify rs_timer timeout.

There is a time gap in [1], during which if the pending rs_timer
becomes not pending. It will miss to hold idev, but the rs_timer
is activated. Thus rs_timer callback function addrconf_rs_timer()
will be executed and put idev later without holding idev. A refcount
underflow issue for idev can be caused by this.

	if (!timer_pending(&idev->rs_timer))
		in6_dev_hold(idev);
		  <--------------[1]
	mod_timer(&idev->rs_timer, jiffies + when);

To fix the issue, hold idev if mod_timer() return 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53189 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
