Subject: CVE-2023-54250: ksmbd: avoid out of bounds access in decode_preauth_ctxt()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: avoid out of bounds access in decode_preauth_ctxt()

Confirm that the accessed pneg_ctxt->HashAlgorithms address sits within
the SMB request boundary; deassemble_neg_contexts() only checks that the
eight byte smb2_neg_context header + (client controlled) DataLength are
within the packet boundary, which is insufficient.

Checking for sizeof(struct smb2_preauth_neg_context) is overkill given
that the type currently assumes SMB311_SALT_SIZE bytes of trailing Salt.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54250 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
