Subject: CVE-2023-53544: cpufreq: davinci: Fix clk use after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: davinci: Fix clk use after free

The remove function first frees the clks and only then calls
cpufreq_unregister_driver(). If one of the cpufreq callbacks is called
just before cpufreq_unregister_driver() is run, the freed clks might be
used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53544 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
