Subject: CVE-2023-54277: fbdev: udlfb: Fix endpoint check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: udlfb: Fix endpoint check

The syzbot fuzzer detected a problem in the udlfb driver, caused by an
endpoint not having the expected type:

usb 1-1: Read EDID byte 0 failed: -71
usb 1-1: Unable to get valid EDID from device/display
------------[ cut here ]------------
usb 1-1: BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 3 != type 1

The current approach for this issue failed to catch the problem
because it only checks for the existence of a bulk-OUT endpoint; it
doesn't check whether this endpoint is the one that the driver will
actually use.

We can fix the problem by instead checking that the endpoint used by
the driver does exist and is bulk-OUT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54277 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
