Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: fix memleak for 'conf->bio_split'

In the error path of raid10_run(), 'conf' need be freed, however,
'conf->bio_split' is missed and memory will be leaked.

Since there are 3 places to free 'conf', factor out a helper to fix the
problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54123 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
