Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix NULL sndbuf_desc in smc_cdc_tx_handler()

When performing a stress test on SMC-R by rmmod mlx5_ib driver
during the wrk/nginx test, we found that there is a probability
of triggering a panic while terminating all link groups.

This issue dues to the race between smc_smcr_terminate_all()
and smc_buf_create().

			smc_smcr_terminate_all

smc_buf_create
/* init */
conn->sndbuf_desc = NULL;
...

			__smc_lgr_terminate
				smc_conn_kill
					smc_close_abort
						smc_cdc_get_slot_and_msg_send

			__softirqentry_text_start
				smc_wr_tx_process_cqe
					smc_cdc_tx_handler
						READ(conn->sndbuf_desc->len);
						/* panic dues to NULL sndbuf_desc */

conn->sndbuf_desc = xxx;

This patch tries to fix the issue by always to check the sndbuf_desc
before send any cdc msg, to make sure that no null pointer is
seen during cqe processing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
