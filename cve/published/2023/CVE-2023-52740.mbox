Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/64s/interrupt: Fix interrupt exit race with security mitigation switch

The RFI and STF security mitigation options can flip the
interrupt_exit_not_reentrant static branch condition concurrently with
the interrupt exit code which tests that branch.

Interrupt exit tests this condition to set MSR[EE|RI] for exit, then
again in the case a soft-masked interrupt is found pending, to recover
the MSR so the interrupt can be replayed before attempting to exit
again. If the condition changes between these two tests, the MSR and irq
soft-mask state will become corrupted, leading to warnings and possible
crashes. For example, if the branch is initially true then false,
MSR[EE] will be 0 but PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS clear and EE may not get
enabled, leading to warnings in irq_64.c.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52740 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86f7e423933608d536015a0f2eb9e0338c1227e0
