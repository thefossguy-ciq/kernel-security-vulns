Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Add sync after creating vram bo

There will be data corruption on vram allocated by svm
if the initialization is not complete and application is
writting on the memory. Adding sync to wait for the
initialization completion is to resolve this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53009 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.9 with commit 92af2d3b57a1afdfdcafb1c6a07ffd89cf3e98fb
	Fixed in 6.2 with commit ba029e9991d9be90a28b6a0ceb25e9a6fb348829

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53009
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_svm.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/92af2d3b57a1afdfdcafb1c6a07ffd89cf3e98fb
