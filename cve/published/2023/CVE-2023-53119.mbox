Subject: CVE-2023-53119: nfc: pn533: initialize struct pn533_out_arg properly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: pn533: initialize struct pn533_out_arg properly

struct pn533_out_arg used as a temporary context for out_urb is not
initialized properly. Its uninitialized 'phy' field can be dereferenced in
error cases inside pn533_out_complete() callback function. It causes the
following failure:

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
