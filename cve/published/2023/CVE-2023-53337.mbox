Subject: CVE-2023-53337: nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only

According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.

After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
be called for buffer heads without the "uptodate" flag and causes the
warning.

Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.

This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53337 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
