Subject: CVE-2023-53389: drm/mediatek: dp: Only trigger DRM HPD events if bridge is attached

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: dp: Only trigger DRM HPD events if bridge is attached

The MediaTek DisplayPort interface bridge driver starts its interrupts
as soon as its probed. However when the interrupts trigger the bridge
might not have been attached to a DRM device. As drm_helper_hpd_irq_event()
does not check whether the passed in drm_device is valid or not, a NULL
pointer passed in results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference in it.

Check whether the bridge is attached and only trigger an HPD event if
it is.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53389 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
