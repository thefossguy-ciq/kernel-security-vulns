Subject: CVE-2023-53644: media: radio-shark: Add endpoint checks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: radio-shark: Add endpoint checks

The syzbot fuzzer was able to provoke a WARNING from the radio-shark2
driver:

The problem was caused by the fact that the driver does not check
whether the endpoints it uses are actually present and have the
appropriate types.  This can be fixed by adding a simple check of
these endpoints (and similarly for the radio-shark driver).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53644 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
