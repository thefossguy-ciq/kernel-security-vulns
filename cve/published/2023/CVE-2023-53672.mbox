Subject: CVE-2023-53672: btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: output extra debug info if we failed to find an inline backref

[BUG]
Syzbot reported several warning triggered inside
lookup_inline_extent_backref().

[CAUSE]
As usual, the reproducer doesn't reliably trigger locally here, but at
least we know the WARN_ON() is triggered when an inline backref can not
be found, and it can only be triggered when @insert is true. (I.e.
inserting a new inline backref, which means the backref should already
exist)

[ENHANCEMENT]
After the WARN_ON(), dump all the parameters and the extent tree
leaf to help debug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53672 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
