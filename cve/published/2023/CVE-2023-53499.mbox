Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_net: Fix error unwinding of XDP initialization

When initializing XDP in virtnet_open(), some rq xdp initialization
may hit an error causing net device open failed. However, previous
rqs have already initialized XDP and enabled NAPI, which is not the
expected behavior. Need to roll back the previous rq initialization
to avoid leaks in error unwinding of init code.

Also extract helper functions of disable and enable queue pairs.
Use newly introduced disable helper function in error unwinding and
virtnet_close. Use enable helper function in virtnet_open.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53499 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
