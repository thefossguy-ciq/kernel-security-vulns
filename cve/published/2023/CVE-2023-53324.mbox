Subject: CVE-2023-53324: drm/msm/mdp5: Don't leak some plane state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/mdp5: Don't leak some plane state

Apparently no one noticed that mdp5 plane states leak like a sieve
ever since we introduced plane_state->commit refcount a few years ago
in 21a01abbe32a ("drm/atomic: Fix freeing connector/plane state too
early by tracking commits, v3.")

Fix it by using the right helpers.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/551236/

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53324 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
