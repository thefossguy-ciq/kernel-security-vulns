Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ptdma: check for null desc before calling pt_cmd_callback

Resolves a panic that can occur on AMD systems, typically during host
shutdown, after the PTDMA driver had been exercised. The issue was
the pt_issue_pending() function is mistakenly assuming that there will
be at least one descriptor in the Submitted queue when the function
is called. However, it is possible that both the Submitted and Issued
queues could be empty, which could result in pt_cmd_callback() being
mistakenly called with a NULL pointer.
Ref: Bugzilla Bug 216856.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
