Subject: CVE-2023-54087: ubi: Fix possible null-ptr-deref in ubi_free_volume()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubi: Fix possible null-ptr-deref in ubi_free_volume()

It willl cause null-ptr-deref in the following case:

uif_init()
  ubi_add_volume()
    cdev_add() -> if it fails, call kill_volumes()
    device_register()

kill_volumes() -> if ubi_add_volume() fails call this function
  ubi_free_volume()
    cdev_del()
    device_unregister() -> trying to delete a not added device,
			   it causes null-ptr-deref

So in ubi_free_volume(), it delete devices whether they are added
or not, it will causes null-ptr-deref.

Handle the error case whlie calling ubi_add_volume() to fix this
problem. If add volume fails, set the corresponding vol to null,
so it can not be accessed in kill_volumes() and release the
resource in ubi_add_volume() error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
