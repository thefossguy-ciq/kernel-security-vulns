Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

VMCI: check context->notify_page after call to get_user_pages_fast() to avoid GPF

The call to get_user_pages_fast() in vmci_host_setup_notify() can return
NULL context->notify_page causing a GPF. To avoid GPF check if
context->notify_page == NULL and return error if so.

general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
