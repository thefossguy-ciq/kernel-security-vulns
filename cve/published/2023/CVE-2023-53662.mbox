Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix memory leaks in ext4_fname_{setup_filename,prepare_lookup}

If the filename casefolding fails, we'll be leaking memory from the
fscrypt_name struct, namely from the 'crypto_buf.name' member.

Make sure we free it in the error path on both ext4_fname_setup_filename()
and ext4_fname_prepare_lookup() functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53662 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
