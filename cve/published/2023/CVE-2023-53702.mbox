Subject: CVE-2023-53702: s390/crypto: use vector instructions only if available for ChaCha20

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/crypto: use vector instructions only if available for ChaCha20

Commit 349d03ffd5f6 ("crypto: s390 - add crypto library interface for
ChaCha20") added a library interface to the s390 specific ChaCha20
implementation. However no check was added to verify if the required
facilities are installed before branching into the assembler code.

If compiled into the kernel, this will lead to the following crash,
if vector instructions are not available:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25e8d30507aa2f251152df1af7809e85b5538f4a
