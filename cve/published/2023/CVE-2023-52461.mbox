Subject: CVE-2023-52461: drm/sched: Fix bounds limiting when given a malformed entity

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sched: Fix bounds limiting when given a malformed entity

If we're given a malformed entity in drm_sched_entity_init()--shouldn't
happen, but we verify--with out-of-bounds priority value, we set it to an
allowed value. Fix the expression which sets this limit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52461 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
