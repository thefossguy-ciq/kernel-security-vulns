Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/srp: Do not call scsi_done() from srp_abort()

After scmd_eh_abort_handler() has called the SCSI LLD eh_abort_handler
callback, it performs one of the following actions:
* Call scsi_queue_insert().
* Call scsi_finish_command().
* Call scsi_eh_scmd_add().
Hence, SCSI abort handlers must not call scsi_done(). Otherwise all
the above actions would trigger a use-after-free. Hence remove the
scsi_done() call from srp_abort(). Keep the srp_free_req() call
before returning SUCCESS because we may not see the command again if
SUCCESS is returned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52515 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
