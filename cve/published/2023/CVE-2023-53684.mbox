Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: Zero padding when dumping algos and encap

When copying data to user-space we should ensure that only valid
data is copied over.  Padding in structures may be filled with
random (possibly sensitve) data and should never be given directly
to user-space.

This patch fixes the copying of xfrm algorithms and the encap
template in xfrm_user so that padding is zeroed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53684 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
