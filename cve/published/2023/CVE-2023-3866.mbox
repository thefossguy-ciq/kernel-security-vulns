Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: validate session id and tree id in the compound request

This patch validate session id and tree id in compound request.
If first operation in the compound is SMB2 ECHO request, ksmbd bypass
session and tree validation. So work->sess and work->tcon could be NULL.
If secound request in the compound access work->sess or tcon, It cause
NULL pointer dereferecing error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-3866 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
