Subject: CVE-2023-54071: wifi: rtw88: use work to update rate to avoid RCU warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: use work to update rate to avoid RCU warning

The ieee80211_ops::sta_rc_update must be atomic, because
ieee80211_chan_bw_change() holds rcu_read lock while calling
drv_sta_rc_update(), so create a work to do original things.

 Voluntary context switch within RCU read-side critical section!

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
