Subject: CVE-2023-54284: media: av7110: prevent underflow in write_ts_to_decoder()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: av7110: prevent underflow in write_ts_to_decoder()

The buf[4] value comes from the user via ts_play().  It is a value in
the u8 range.  The final length we pass to av7110_ipack_instant_repack()
is "len - (buf[4] + 1) - 4" so add a check to ensure that the length is
not negative.  It's not clear that passing a negative len value does
anything bad necessarily, but it's not best practice.

With the new bounds checking the "if (!len)" condition is no longer
possible or required so remove that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54284 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
