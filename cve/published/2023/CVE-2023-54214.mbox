Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix potential user-after-free

This fixes all instances of which requires to allocate a buffer calling
alloc_skb which may release the chan lock and reacquire later which
makes it possible that the chan is disconnected in the meantime.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54214 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
