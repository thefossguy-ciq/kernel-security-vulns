Subject: CVE-2023-53295: udf: Do not update file length for failed writes to inline files

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: Do not update file length for failed writes to inline files

When write to inline file fails (or happens only partly), we still
updated length of inline data as if the whole write succeeded. Fix the
update of length of inline data to happen only if the write succeeds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
