Subject: CVE-2023-52997: ipv4: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget in ip_metrics_convert()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget in ip_metrics_convert()

if (!type)
		continue;
	if (type > RTAX_MAX)
		return -EINVAL;
	...
	metrics[type - 1] = val;

@type being used as an array index, we need to prevent
cpu speculation or risk leaking kernel memory content.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
