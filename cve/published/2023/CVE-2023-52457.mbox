Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing if pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed

Returning an error code from .remove() makes the driver core emit the
little helpful error message:

	remove callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored.

and then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freed
are leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the
potential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.

So replace the error return (and with it the little helpful error
message) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52457 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
