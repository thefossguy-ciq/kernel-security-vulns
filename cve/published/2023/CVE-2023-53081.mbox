Subject: CVE-2023-53081: ocfs2: fix data corruption after failed write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix data corruption after failed write

When buffered write fails to copy data into underlying page cache page,
ocfs2_write_end_nolock() just zeroes out and dirties the page.  This can
leave dirty page beyond EOF and if page writeback tries to write this page
before write succeeds and expands i_size, page gets into inconsistent
state where page dirty bit is clear but buffer dirty bits stay set
resulting in page data never getting written and so data copied to the
page is lost.  Fix the problem by invalidating page beyond EOF after
failed write.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
