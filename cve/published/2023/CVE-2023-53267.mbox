Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver: soc: xilinx: fix memory leak in xlnx_add_cb_for_notify_event()

The kfree() should be called when memory fails to be allocated for
cb_data in xlnx_add_cb_for_notify_event(), otherwise there will be
a memory leak, so add kfree() to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53267 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
