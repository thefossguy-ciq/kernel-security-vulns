Subject: CVE-2023-53558: rcu-tasks: Avoid pr_info() with spin lock in cblist_init_generic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu-tasks: Avoid pr_info() with spin lock in cblist_init_generic()

pr_info() is called with rtp->cbs_gbl_lock spin lock locked.  Because
pr_info() calls printk() that might sleep, this will result in BUG
like below:

[    0.206455] cblist_init_generic: Setting adjustable number of callback queues.

This patch moves pr_info() so that it is called without
rtp->cbs_gbl_lock locked.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
