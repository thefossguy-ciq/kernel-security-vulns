Subject: CVE-2023-53144: erofs: fix wrong kunmap when using LZMA on HIGHMEM platforms

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix wrong kunmap when using LZMA on HIGHMEM platforms

As the call trace shown, the root cause is kunmap incorrect pages:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000

The bug is trivial and should be fixed now.  It has no impact on
!HIGHMEM platforms.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53144 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
