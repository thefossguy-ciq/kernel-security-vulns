Subject: CVE-2023-53432: firewire: net: fix use after free in fwnet_finish_incoming_packet()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firewire: net: fix use after free in fwnet_finish_incoming_packet()

The netif_rx() function frees the skb so we can't dereference it to

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
