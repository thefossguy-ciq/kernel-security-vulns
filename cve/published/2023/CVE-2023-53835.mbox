Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: don't clear SB_RDONLY when remounting r/w until quota is re-enabled

When a file system currently mounted read/only is remounted
read/write, if we clear the SB_RDONLY flag too early, before the quota
is initialized, and there is another process/thread constantly
attempting to create a directory, it's possible to trigger the

	WARN_ON_ONCE(dquot_initialize_needed(inode));

in ext4_xattr_block_set(), with the following stack trace:

   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5338 at fs/ext4/xattr.c:2141 ext4_xattr_block_set+0x2ef2/0x3680

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
