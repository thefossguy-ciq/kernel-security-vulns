Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix fget leak when fs don't support nowait buffered read

Heming reported a BUG when using io_uring doing link-cp on ocfs2. [1]

Do the following steps can reproduce this BUG:
mount -t ocfs2 /dev/vdc /mnt/ocfs2
cp testfile /mnt/ocfs2/
./link-cp /mnt/ocfs2/testfile /mnt/ocfs2/testfile.1
umount /mnt/ocfs2

Then umount will fail, and it outputs:
umount: /mnt/ocfs2: target is busy.

While tracing umount, it blames mnt_get_count() not return as expected.
Do a deep investigation for fget()/fput() on related code flow, I've
finally found that fget() leaks since ocfs2 doesn't support nowait
buffered read.

io_issue_sqe
|-io_assign_file  // do fget() first
  |-io_read
  |-io_iter_do_read
    |-ocfs2_file_read_iter  // return -EOPNOTSUPP
  |-kiocb_done
    |-io_rw_done
      |-__io_complete_rw_common  // set REQ_F_REISSUE
    |-io_resubmit_prep
      |-io_req_prep_async  // override req->file, leak happens

This was introduced by commit a196c78b5443 in v5.18. Fix it by don't
re-assign req->file if it has already been assigned.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
