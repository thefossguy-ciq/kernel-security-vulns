Subject: CVE-2023-53152: drm/amdgpu: fix calltrace warning in amddrm_buddy_fini

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix calltrace warning in amddrm_buddy_fini

The following call trace is observed when removing the amdgpu driver, which
is caused by that BOs allocated for psp are not freed until removing.

For smu v13_0_2, if the GPU supports xgmi, refer to

commit f5c7e7797060 ("drm/amdgpu: Adjust removal control flow for smu v13_0_2"),

it will run gpu recover in AMDGPU_RESET_FOR_DEVICE_REMOVE mode when removing,
which makes all devices in hive list have hw reset but no resume except the
basic ip blocks, then other ip blocks will not call .hw_fini according to
ip_block.status.hw.

Since psp_free_shared_bufs just includes some software operations, so move
it to psp_sw_fini.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53152 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
