Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Avoid potential vm use-after-free

Adding the vm to the vm_xa table makes it visible to userspace, which
could try to race with us to close the vm.  So we need to take our extra
reference before putting it in the table.

(cherry picked from commit 99343c46d4e2b34c285d3d5f68ff04274c2f9fb4)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52931 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/764accc2c1b8fd1507be2e7f436c94cdce887a00
