Subject: CVE-2023-53745: um: vector: Fix memory leak in vector_config

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: vector: Fix memory leak in vector_config

If the return value of the uml_parse_vector_ifspec function is NULL,
we should call kfree(params) to prevent memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53745 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
