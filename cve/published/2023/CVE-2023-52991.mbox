Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list

Commit 3a1296a38d0c ("net: Support GRO/GSO fraglist chaining.")
introduced UDP listifyed GRO. The segmentation relies on frag_list being
untouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be
broken sometimes, where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area,
leaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger
following NULL pointer dereference, and panic the kernel. Reverse the
test condition should fix it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
