Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: do not run mt76_unregister_device() on unregistered hw

Trying to probe a mt7921e pci card without firmware results in a
successful probe where ieee80211_register_hw hasn't been called. When
removing the driver, ieee802111_unregister_hw is called unconditionally
leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference.
Fix the issue running mt76_unregister_device routine just for registered
hw.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
