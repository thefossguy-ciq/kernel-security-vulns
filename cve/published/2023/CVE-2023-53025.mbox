Subject: CVE-2023-53025: NFSD: fix use-after-free in nfsd4_ssc_setup_dul()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix use-after-free in nfsd4_ssc_setup_dul()

If signal_pending() returns true, schedule_timeout() will not be executed,
causing the waiting task to remain in the wait queue.
Fixed by adding a call to finish_wait(), which ensures that the waiting
task will always be removed from the wait queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
