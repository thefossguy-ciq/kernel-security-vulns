Subject: CVE-2023-54145: bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: drop unnecessary user-triggerable WARN_ONCE in verifierl log

It's trivial for user to trigger "verifier log line truncated" warning,
as verifier has a fixed-sized buffer of 1024 bytes (as of now), and there are at
least two pieces of user-provided information that can be output through
this buffer, and both can be arbitrarily sized by user:
  - BTF names;
  - BTF.ext source code lines strings.

Verifier log buffer should be properly sized for typical verifier state
output. But it's sort-of expected that this buffer won't be long enough
in some circumstances. So let's drop the check. In any case code will
work correctly, at worst truncating a part of a single line output.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54145 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
