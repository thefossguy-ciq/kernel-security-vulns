Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (pmbus_core) Fix NULL pointer dereference

Pass i2c_client to _pmbus_is_enabled to drop the assumption
that a regulator device is passed in.

This will fix the issue of a NULL pointer dereference when called from
_pmbus_get_flags.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53206 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7444253cacd92412bc8d33d1c9b5401f52cdf0e2
