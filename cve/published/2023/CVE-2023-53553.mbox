Subject: CVE-2023-53553: HID: hyperv: avoid struct memcpy overrun warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hyperv: avoid struct memcpy overrun warning

A previous patch addressed the fortified memcpy warning for most
builds, but I still see this one with gcc-9:

In file included from include/linux/string.h:254,
                 from drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:8:
In function 'fortify_memcpy_chk',
    inlined from 'mousevsc_on_receive' at drivers/hid/hid-hyperv.c:272:3:
include/linux/fortify-string.h:583:4: error: call to '__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected write beyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Werror=attribute-warning]
  583 |    __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);
      |    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My guess is that the WARN_ON() itself is what confuses gcc, so it no
longer sees that there is a correct range check. Rework the code in a
way that helps readability and avoids the warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53553 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
