This bug is caused by the fact that usbnet trusts the bulk endpoint
addresses its probe routine receives in the driver_info structure, and
it does not check to see that these endpoints actually exist and have
the expected type and directions.

The fix is simply to add such a check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53548 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
