Subject: CVE-2023-53268: ASoC: fsl_mqs: move of_node_put() to the correct location

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: fsl_mqs: move of_node_put() to the correct location

of_node_put() should have been done directly after
mqs_priv->regmap = syscon_node_to_regmap(gpr_np);
otherwise it creates a reference leak on the success path.

To fix this, of_node_put() is moved to the correct location, and change
all the gotos to direct returns.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53268 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
