Subject: CVE-2023-53609: scsi: Revert "scsi: core: Do not increase scsi_device's iorequest_cnt if dispatch failed"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: Revert "scsi: core: Do not increase scsi_device's iorequest_cnt if dispatch failed"

The "atomic_inc(&cmd->device->iorequest_cnt)" in scsi_queue_rq() would
cause kernel panic because cmd->device may be freed after returning from
scsi_dispatch_cmd().

This reverts commit cfee29ffb45b1c9798011b19d454637d1b0fe87d.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53609 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
