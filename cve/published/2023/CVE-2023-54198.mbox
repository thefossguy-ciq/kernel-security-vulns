Subject: CVE-2023-54198: tty: fix out-of-bounds access in tty_driver_lookup_tty()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: fix out-of-bounds access in tty_driver_lookup_tty()

When specifying an invalid console= device like console=tty3270,
tty_driver_lookup_tty() returns the tty struct without checking
whether index is a valid number.

To reproduce:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -serial mon:stdio \
-kernel ../linux-build-x86/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
-append "console=ttyS0 console=tty3270"

This crashes with:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
