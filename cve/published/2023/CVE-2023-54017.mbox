Subject: CVE-2023-54017: powerpc/pseries: fix possible memory leak in ibmebus_bus_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: fix possible memory leak in ibmebus_bus_init()

If device_register() returns error in ibmebus_bus_init(), name of kobject
which is allocated in dev_set_name() called in device_add() is leaked.

As comment of device_add() says, it should call put_device() to drop
the reference count that was set in device_initialize() when it fails,
so the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
