Subject: CVE-2023-53016: Bluetooth: Fix possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change

syzbot reports a possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change [1].
While rfcomm_sock_connect acquires the sk lock and waits for
the rfcomm lock, rfcomm_sock_release could have the rfcomm
lock and hit a deadlock for acquiring the sk lock.
Here's a simplified flow:

rfcomm_sock_connect:
  lock_sock(sk)
  rfcomm_dlc_open:
    rfcomm_lock()

rfcomm_sock_release:
  rfcomm_sock_shutdown:
    rfcomm_lock()
    __rfcomm_dlc_close:
        rfcomm_k_state_change:
	  lock_sock(sk)

This patch drops the sk lock before calling rfcomm_dlc_open to
avoid the possible deadlock and holds sk's reference count to
prevent use-after-free after rfcomm_dlc_open completes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53016 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
