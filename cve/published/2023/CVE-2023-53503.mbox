Subject: CVE-2023-53503: ext4: allow ext4_get_group_info() to fail

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: allow ext4_get_group_info() to fail

Previously, ext4_get_group_info() would treat an invalid group number
as BUG(), since in theory it should never happen.  However, if a
malicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block
device while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for
s_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,
when calculating the block group of some block number (such as the
starting block of a preallocation region), could result in an
underflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in
ext4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service
attack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to
the block device.

For a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if
the system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it
will not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()
will call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in
all of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.

Also, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an
inline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the
compiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53503 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
