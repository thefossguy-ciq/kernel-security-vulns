Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Make it so that a waiting process can be aborted

When sendmsg() creates an rxrpc call, it queues it to wait for a connection
and channel to be assigned and then waits before it can start shovelling
data as the encrypted DATA packet content includes a summary of the
connection parameters.

However, sendmsg() may get interrupted before a connection gets assigned
and further sendmsg() calls will fail with EBUSY until an assignment is
made.

Fix this so that the call can at least be aborted without failing on
EBUSY.  We have to be careful here as sendmsg() mustn't be allowed to start
the call timer if the call doesn't yet have a connection assigned as an
oops may follow shortly thereafter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53218 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
