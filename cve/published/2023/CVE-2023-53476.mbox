Subject: CVE-2023-53476: iw_cxgb4: Fix potential NULL dereference in c4iw_fill_res_cm_id_entry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iw_cxgb4: Fix potential NULL dereference in c4iw_fill_res_cm_id_entry()

This condition needs to match the previous "if (epcp->state == LISTEN) {"
exactly to avoid a NULL dereference of either "listen_ep" or "ep". The
problem is that "epcp" has been re-assigned so just testing
"if (epcp->state == LISTEN) {" a second time is not sufficient.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53476 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
