Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: htc_hst: free skb in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() if there is no callback function

It is stated that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees the provided skb or
passes its management to another callback function. However, the skb is
not freed in case there is no another callback function, and Syzkaller was
able to cause a memory leak. Also minor comment fix.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53802 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
