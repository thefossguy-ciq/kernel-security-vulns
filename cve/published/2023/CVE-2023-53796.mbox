Subject: CVE-2023-53796: f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()

When converting an inline directory to a regular one, f2fs is leaking
uninitialized memory to disk because it doesn't initialize the entire
directory block.  Fix this by zero-initializing the block.

This bug was introduced by commit 4ec17d688d74 ("f2fs: avoid unneeded
initializing when converting inline dentry"), which didn't consider the
security implications of leaking uninitialized memory to disk.

This was found by running xfstest generic/435 on a KMSAN-enabled kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53796 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
