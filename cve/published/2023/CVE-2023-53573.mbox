Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: rs9: Fix suspend/resume

Disabling the cache in commit 2ff4ba9e3702 ("clk: rs9: Fix I2C accessors")
without removing cache synchronization in resume path results in a
kernel panic as map->cache_ops is unset, due to REGCACHE_NONE.
Enable flat cache again to support resume again. num_reg_defaults_raw
is necessary to read the cache defaults from hardware. Some registers
are strapped in hardware and cannot be provided in software.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53573 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
