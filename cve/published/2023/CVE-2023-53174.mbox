Subject: CVE-2023-53174: scsi: core: Fix possible memory leak if device_add() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix possible memory leak if device_add() fails

If device_add() returns error, the name allocated by dev_set_name() needs
be freed. As the comment of device_add() says, put_device() should be used
to decrease the reference count in the error path. So fix this by calling
put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanp().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53174 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
