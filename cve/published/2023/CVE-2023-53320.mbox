Subject: CVE-2023-53320: scsi: mpi3mr: Fix issues in mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix issues in mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info()

The function mpi3mr_get_all_tgt_info() has four issues:

1) It calculates valid entry length in alltgt_info assuming the header part
   of the struct mpi3mr_device_map_info would equal to sizeof(u32).  The
   correct size is sizeof(u64).

2) When it calculates the valid entry length kern_entrylen, it excludes one
   entry by subtracting 1 from num_devices.

3) It copies num_device by calling memcpy(). Substitution is enough.

4) It does not specify the calculated length to sg_copy_from_buffer().
   Instead, it specifies the payload length which is larger than the
   alltgt_info size. It causes "BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds".

Fix the issues by using the correct header size, removing the subtraction
from num_devices, replacing the memcpy() with substitution and specifying
the correct length to sg_copy_from_buffer().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53320 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
