Subject: CVE-2023-53400: ALSA: hda: Fix Oops by 9.1 surround channel names

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix Oops by 9.1 surround channel names

get_line_out_pfx() may trigger an Oops by overflowing the static array
with more than 8 channels.  This was reported for MacBookPro 12,1 with
Cirrus codec.

As a workaround, extend for the 9.1 channels and also fix the
potential Oops by unifying the code paths accessing the same array
with the proper size check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53400 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
