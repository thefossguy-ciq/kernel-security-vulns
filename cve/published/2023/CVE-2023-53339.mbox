Subject: CVE-2023-53339: btrfs: fix BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance

Pausing and canceling balance can race to interrupt balance lead to BUG_ON
panic in btrfs_cancel_balance. The BUG_ON condition in btrfs_cancel_balance
does not take this race scenario into account.

However, the race condition has no other side effects. We can fix that.

Reproducing it with panic trace like this:

  kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/volumes.c:4618!
  RIP: 0010:btrfs_cancel_balance+0x5cf/0x6a0
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>

   ? hrtimer_nanosleep+0xb7/0x1a0

  Race scenario as follows:
  > mutex_unlock(&fs_info->balance_mutex);
  > --------------------
  > .......issue pause and cancel req in another thread
  > --------------------
  > ret = __btrfs_balance(fs_info);
  >
  > mutex_lock(&fs_info->balance_mutex);
  > if (ret == -ECANCELED && atomic_read(&fs_info->balance_pause_req)) {
  >         btrfs_info(fs_info, "balance: paused");
  >         btrfs_exclop_balance(fs_info, BTRFS_EXCLOP_BALANCE_PAUSED);
  > }

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53339 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
