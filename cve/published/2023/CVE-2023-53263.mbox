Subject: CVE-2023-53263: drm/nouveau/disp: fix use-after-free in error handling of nouveau_connector_create

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau/disp: fix use-after-free in error handling of nouveau_connector_create

We can't simply free the connector after calling drm_connector_init on it.
We need to clean up the drm side first.

It might not fix all regressions from commit 2b5d1c29f6c4
("drm/nouveau/disp: PIOR DP uses GPIO for HPD, not PMGR AUX interrupts"),
but at least it fixes a memory corruption in error handling related to
that commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53263 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
