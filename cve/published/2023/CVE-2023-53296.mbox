Subject: CVE-2023-53296: sctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf

This patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream count may change
after wait_for_sndbuf.

When the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream
count is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N - 2,
another thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number
N - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.

However, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream count in the client is
shrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The crash
occurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a
non-existing stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:

  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000038-0x000000000000003f]
  Call Trace:

The fix is to add an unlikely check for the send stream number after the
thread wakes up from the wait_for_sndbuf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53296 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
