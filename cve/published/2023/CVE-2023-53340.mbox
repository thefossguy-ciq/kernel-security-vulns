Subject: CVE-2023-53340: net/mlx5: Collect command failures data only for known commands

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Collect command failures data only for known commands

DEVX can issue a general command, which is not used by mlx5 driver.
In case such command is failed, mlx5 is trying to collect the failure
data, However, mlx5 doesn't create a storage for this command, since
mlx5 doesn't use it. This lead to array-index-out-of-bounds error.

Fix it by checking whether the command is known before collecting the
failure data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53340 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
