Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: can: j1939: enhanced error handling for tightly received RTS messages in xtp_rx_rts_session_new

This patch enhances error handling in scenarios with RTS (Request to
Send) messages arriving closely. It replaces the less informative WARN_ON_ONCE
backtraces with a new error handling method. This provides clearer error
messages and allows for the early termination of problematic sessions.
Previously, sessions were only released at the end of j1939_xtp_rx_rts().

Potentially this could be reproduced with something like:
testj1939 -r vcan0:0x80 &
while true; do
	# send first RTS
	cansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;
	# send second RTS
	cansend vcan0 18EC8090#1014000303002301;
	# send abort
	cansend vcan0 18EC8090#ff00000000002301;
done

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
