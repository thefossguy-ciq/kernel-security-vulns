Subject: CVE-2023-54210: Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_remove_adv_monitor()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_remove_adv_monitor()

KASAN reports that there's a use-after-free in
hci_remove_adv_monitor(). Trawling through the disassembly, you can
see that the complaint is from the access in bt_dev_dbg() under the
HCI_ADV_MONITOR_EXT_MSFT case. The problem case happens because
msft_remove_monitor() can end up freeing the monitor
structure. Specifically:
  hci_remove_adv_monitor() ->
  msft_remove_monitor() ->
  msft_remove_monitor_sync() ->
  msft_le_cancel_monitor_advertisement_cb() ->
  hci_free_adv_monitor()

Let's fix the problem by just stashing the relevant data when it's
still valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54210 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
