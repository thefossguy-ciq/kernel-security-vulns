Subject: CVE-2023-54275: wifi: ath11k: Fix memory leak in ath11k_peer_rx_frag_setup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: Fix memory leak in ath11k_peer_rx_frag_setup

crypto_alloc_shash() allocates resources, which should be released by
crypto_free_shash(). When ath11k_peer_find() fails, there has memory
leak. Add missing crypto_free_shash() to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54275 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
