Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rt2x00: Fix memory leak when handling surveys

When removing a rt2x00 device, its associated channel surveys
are not freed, causing a memory leak observable with kmemleak:

unreferenced object 0xffff9620f0881a00 (size 512):
  comm "systemd-udevd", pid 2290, jiffies 4294906974 (age 33.768s)

Fix this by freeing the channel surveys on device removal.

Tested with a RT3070 based USB wireless adapter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
