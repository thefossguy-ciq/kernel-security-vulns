Subject: CVE-2023-53759: HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hidraw: fix data race on device refcount

The hidraw_open() function increments the hidraw device reference
counter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,
resulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.

The race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 ("HID:
hidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem"). While
minors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead
acquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.
This is symmetrical to hidraw_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53759 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
