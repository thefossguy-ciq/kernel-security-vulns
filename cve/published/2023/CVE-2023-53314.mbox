Subject: CVE-2023-53314: fbdev/ep93xx-fb: Do not assign to struct fb_info.dev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev/ep93xx-fb: Do not assign to struct fb_info.dev

Do not assing the Linux device to struct fb_info.dev. The call to
register_framebuffer() initializes the field to the fbdev device.
Drivers should not override its value.

Fixes a bug where the driver incorrectly decreases the hardware
device's reference counter and leaks the fbdev device.

v2:
	* add Fixes tag (Dan)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53314 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
