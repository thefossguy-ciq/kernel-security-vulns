Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: common: Fix refcount leak in parse_dai_link_info

Add missing of_node_put()s before the returns to balance
of_node_get()s and of_node_put()s, which may get unbalanced
in case the for loop 'for_each_available_child_of_node' returns
early.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e40722d55805584dc04d8594d912820cafb2432
