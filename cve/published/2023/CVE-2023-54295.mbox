Subject: CVE-2023-54295: mtd: spi-nor: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in spi_nor_set_erase_type

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: spi-nor: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in spi_nor_set_erase_type

spi_nor_set_erase_type() was used either to set or to mask out an erase
type. When we used it to mask out an erase type a shift-out-of-bounds
was hit:
UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/mtd/spi-nor/core.c:2237:24
shift exponent 4294967295 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

The setting of the size_{shift, mask} and of the opcode are unnecessary
when the erase size is zero, as throughout the code just the erase size
is considered to determine whether an erase type is supported or not.
Setting the opcode to 0xFF was wrong too as nobody guarantees that 0xFF
is an unused opcode. Thus when masking out an erase type, just set the
erase size to zero. This will fix the shift-out-of-bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
