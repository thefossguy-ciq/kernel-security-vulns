Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix device management cmd timeout flow

In the UFS error handling flow, the host will send a device management cmd
(NOP OUT) to the device for link recovery. If this cmd times out and
clearing the doorbell fails, ufshcd_wait_for_dev_cmd() will do nothing and
return. hba->dev_cmd.complete struct is not set to NULL.

When this happens, if cmd has been completed by device, then we will call
complete() in __ufshcd_transfer_req_compl(). Because the complete struct is
allocated on the stack, the following crash will occur:

  ipanic_die+0x24/0x38 [mrdump]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
