Subject: CVE-2023-53241: nfsd: call op_release, even when op_func returns an error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: call op_release, even when op_func returns an error

For ops with "trivial" replies, nfsd4_encode_operation will shortcut
most of the encoding work and skip to just marshalling up the status.
One of the things it skips is calling op_release. This could cause a
memory leak in the layoutget codepath if there is an error at an
inopportune time.

Have the compound processing engine always call op_release, even when
op_func sets an error in op->status. With this change, we also need
nfsd4_block_get_device_info_scsi to set the gd_device pointer to NULL
on error to avoid a double free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53241 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
