Subject: CVE-2023-53542: ARM: dts: exynos: Use Exynos5420 compatible for the MIPI video phy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: dts: exynos: Use Exynos5420 compatible for the MIPI video phy

For some reason, the driver adding support for Exynos5420 MIPI phy
back in 2016 wasn't used on Exynos5420, which caused a kernel panic.
Add the proper compatible for it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53542 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
