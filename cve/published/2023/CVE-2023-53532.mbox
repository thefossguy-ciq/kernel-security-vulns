Subject: CVE-2023-53532: wifi: ath11k: fix deinitialization of firmware resources

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix deinitialization of firmware resources

Currently, in ath11k_ahb_fw_resources_init(), iommu domain
mapping is done only for the chipsets having fixed firmware
memory. Also, for such chipsets, mapping is done only if it
does not have TrustZone support.

During deinitialization, only if TrustZone support is not there,
iommu is unmapped back. However, for non fixed firmware memory
chipsets, TrustZone support is not there and this makes the
condition check to true and it tries to unmap the memory which
was not mapped during initialization.

This leads to the following trace -

This can be reproduced by probing an AHB chipset which is not
having a fixed memory region. During reboot (or rmmod) trace
can be seen.

Fix this issue by adding a condition check on firmware fixed memory
hw_param as done in the counter initialization function.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
