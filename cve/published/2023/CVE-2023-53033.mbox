Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_payload: incorrect arithmetics when fetching VLAN header bits

If the offset + length goes over the ethernet + vlan header, then the
length is adjusted to copy the bytes that are within the boundaries of
the vlan_ethhdr scratchpad area. The remaining bytes beyond ethernet +
vlan header are copied directly from the skbuff data area.

Fix incorrect arithmetic operator: subtract, not add, the size of the
vlan header in case of double-tagged packets to adjust the length
accordingly to address CVE-2023-0179.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53033 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
