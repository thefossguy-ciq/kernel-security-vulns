Subject: CVE-2023-53676: scsi: target: iscsi: Fix buffer overflow in lio_target_nacl_info_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: iscsi: Fix buffer overflow in lio_target_nacl_info_show()

The function lio_target_nacl_info_show() uses sprintf() in a loop to print
details for every iSCSI connection in a session without checking for the
buffer length. With enough iSCSI connections it's possible to overflow the
buffer provided by configfs and corrupt the memory.

This patch replaces sprintf() with sysfs_emit_at() that checks for buffer
boundries.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53676 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
