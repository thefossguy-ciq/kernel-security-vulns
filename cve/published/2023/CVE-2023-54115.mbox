Subject: CVE-2023-54115: pcmcia: rsrc_nonstatic: Fix memory leak in nonstatic_release_resource_db()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pcmcia: rsrc_nonstatic: Fix memory leak in nonstatic_release_resource_db()

When nonstatic_release_resource_db() frees all resources associated
with an PCMCIA socket, it forgets to free socket_data too, causing
a memory leak observable with kmemleak:

unreferenced object 0xc28d1000 (size 64):
  comm "systemd-udevd", pid 297, jiffies 4294898478 (age 194.484s)

Fix this by freeing socket_data too.

Tested on a Acer Travelmate 4002WLMi by manually binding/unbinding
the yenta_cardbus driver (yenta_socket).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54115 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
