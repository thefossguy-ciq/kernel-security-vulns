Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

squashfs: harden sanity check in squashfs_read_xattr_id_table

While mounting a corrupted filesystem, a signed integer '*xattr_ids' can
become less than zero.  This leads to the incorrect computation of 'len'
and 'indexes' values which can cause null-ptr-deref in copy_bio_to_actor()
or out-of-bounds accesses in the next sanity checks inside
squashfs_read_xattr_id_table().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
