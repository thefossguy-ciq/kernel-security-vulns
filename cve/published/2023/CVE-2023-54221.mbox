Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: imx93: fix memory leak and missing unwind goto in imx93_clocks_probe

In function probe(), it returns directly without unregistered hws
when error occurs.

Fix this by adding 'goto unregister_hws;' on line 295 and
line 310.

Use devm_kzalloc() instead of kzalloc() to automatically
free the memory using devm_kfree() when error occurs.

Replace of_iomap() with devm_of_iomap() to automatically
handle the unused ioremap region and delete 'iounmap(anatop_base);'
in unregister_hws.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54221 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
