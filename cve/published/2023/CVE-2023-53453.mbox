Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: free iio for atombios when driver shutdown

Fix below kmemleak when unload radeon driver:

unreferenced object 0xffff9f8608ede200 (size 512):

iio was allocated in atom_index_iio() called by atom_parse(),
but it doesn't got released when the dirver is shutdown.
Fix this kmemleak by free it in radeon_atombios_fini().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53453 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
