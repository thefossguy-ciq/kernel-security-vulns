Subject: CVE-2023-54094: net: prevent skb corruption on frag list segmentation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: prevent skb corruption on frag list segmentation

Ian reported several skb corruptions triggered by rx-gro-list,
collecting different oops alike:

In the critical scenario, rx-gro-list GRO-ed packets are fed, via a
bridge, both to the local input path and to an egress device (tun).

The segmentation of such packets unsafely writes to the cloned skbs
with shared heads.

This change addresses the issue by uncloning as needed the
to-be-segmented skbs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
