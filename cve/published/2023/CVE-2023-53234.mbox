The reason is that put_device is not be called if cdev_device_add fails
and wdd->id != 0.

watchdog_cdev_register
  wd_data = kzalloc                             [1]
  err = dev_set_name                            [2]
  ..
  err = cdev_device_add
  if (err) {
    if (wdd->id == 0) {  // wdd->id != 0
      ..
    }
    return err;  // [1],[2] would be leaked

To fix it, call put_device in all wdd->id cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
