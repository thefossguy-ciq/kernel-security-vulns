Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: clean up skbs if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails

Syzkaller detected a memory leak of skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().
While processing skbs in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(), the already allocated
skbs in skb_pool are not freed if ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() fails. If we
have an incorrect pkt_len or pkt_tag, the input skb is considered invalid
and dropped. All the associated packets already in skb_pool should be
dropped and freed. Added a comment describing this issue.

The patch also makes remain_skb NULL after being processed so that it
cannot be referenced after potential free. The initialization of hif_dev
fields which are associated with remain_skb (rx_remain_len,
rx_transfer_len and rx_pad_len) is moved after a new remain_skb is
allocated.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53199 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
