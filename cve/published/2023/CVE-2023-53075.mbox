Subject: CVE-2023-53075: ftrace: Fix invalid address access in lookup_rec() when index is 0

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix invalid address access in lookup_rec() when index is 0

KASAN reported follow problem:

 BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in lookup_rec
 Read of size 8 at addr ffff000199270ff0 by task modprobe
 CPU: 2 Comm: modprobe
 Call trace:
  kasan_report
  __asan_load8
  lookup_rec
  ftrace_location
  arch_check_ftrace_location
  check_kprobe_address_safe
  register_kprobe

When checking pg->records[pg->index - 1].ip in lookup_rec(), it can get a
pg which is newly added to ftrace_pages_start in ftrace_process_locs().
Before the first pg->index++, index is 0 and accessing pg->records[-1].ip
will cause this problem.

Don't check the ip when pg->index is 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
