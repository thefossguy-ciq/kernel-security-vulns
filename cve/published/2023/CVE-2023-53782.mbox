Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dccp: Fix out of bounds access in DCCP error handler

There was a previous attempt to fix an out-of-bounds access in the DCCP
error handlers, but that fix assumed that the error handlers only want
to access the first 8 bytes of the DCCP header. Actually, they also look
at the DCCP sequence number, which is stored beyond 8 bytes, so an
explicit pskb_may_pull() is required.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53782 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
