Subject: CVE-2023-54090: ixgbe: Fix panic during XDP_TX with > 64 CPUs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbe: Fix panic during XDP_TX with > 64 CPUs

Commit 4fe815850bdc ("ixgbe: let the xdpdrv work with more than 64 cpus")
adds support to allow XDP programs to run on systems with more than
64 CPUs by locking the XDP TX rings and indexing them using cpu % 64
(IXGBE_MAX_XDP_QS).

Upon trying this out patch on a system with more than 64 cores,
the kernel paniced with an array-index-out-of-bounds at the return in
ixgbe_determine_xdp_ring in ixgbe.h, which means ixgbe_determine_xdp_q_idx
was just returning the cpu instead of cpu % IXGBE_MAX_XDP_QS.  An example
splat:

I think this is how it happens:

Upon loading the first XDP program on a system with more than 64 CPUs,
ixgbe_xdp_locking_key is incremented in ixgbe_xdp_setup.  However,
immediately after this, the rings are reconfigured by ixgbe_setup_tc.
ixgbe_setup_tc calls ixgbe_clear_interrupt_scheme which calls
ixgbe_free_q_vectors which calls ixgbe_free_q_vector in a loop.
ixgbe_free_q_vector decrements ixgbe_xdp_locking_key once per call if
it is non-zero.  Commenting out the decrement in ixgbe_free_q_vector
stopped my system from panicing.

I suspect to make the original patch work, I would need to load an XDP
program and then replace it in order to get ixgbe_xdp_locking_key back
above 0 since ixgbe_setup_tc is only called when transitioning between
XDP and non-XDP ring configurations, while ixgbe_xdp_locking_key is
incremented every time ixgbe_xdp_setup is called.

Also, ixgbe_setup_tc can be called via ethtool --set-channels, so this
becomes another path to decrement ixgbe_xdp_locking_key to 0 on systems
with more than 64 CPUs.

Since ixgbe_xdp_locking_key only protects the XDP_TX path and is tied
to the number of CPUs present, there is no reason to disable it upon
unloading an XDP program.  To avoid confusion, I have moved enabling
ixgbe_xdp_locking_key into ixgbe_sw_init, which is part of the probe path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54090 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
