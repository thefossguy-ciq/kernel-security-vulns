Subject: CVE-2023-54068: f2fs: compress: fix to call f2fs_wait_on_page_writeback() in f2fs_write_raw_pages()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix to call f2fs_wait_on_page_writeback() in f2fs_write_raw_pages()

BUG_ON() will be triggered when writing files concurrently,
because the same page is writtenback multiple times.

1597 void folio_end_writeback(struct folio *folio)
1598 {
		......
1618     if (!__folio_end_writeback(folio))
1619         BUG();
		......
1625 }

kernel BUG at mm/filemap.c:1619!

Below is the concurrency scenario:

[Process A]		[Process B]		[Process C]
f2fs_write_raw_pages()
  - redirty_page_for_writepage()
  - unlock page()
			f2fs_do_write_data_page()
			  - lock_page()
			  - clear_page_dirty_for_io()
			  - set_page_writeback() [1st writeback]
			    .....
			    - unlock page()

						generic_perform_write()
						  - f2fs_write_begin()
						    - wait_for_stable_page()

						  - f2fs_write_end()
						    - set_page_dirty()

  - lock_page()
    - f2fs_do_write_data_page()
      - set_page_writeback() [2st writeback]

This problem was introduced by the previous commit 7377e853967b ("f2fs:
compress: fix potential deadlock of compress file"). All pagelocks were
released in f2fs_write_raw_pages(), but whether the page was
in the writeback state was ignored in the subsequent writing process.
Let's fix it by waiting for the page to writeback before writing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
