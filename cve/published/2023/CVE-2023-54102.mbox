Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Prevent lpfc_debugfs_lockstat_write() buffer overflow

A static code analysis tool flagged the possibility of buffer overflow when
using copy_from_user() for a debugfs entry.

Currently, it is possible that copy_from_user() copies more bytes than what
would fit in the mybuf char array.  Add a min() restriction check between
sizeof(mybuf) - 1 and nbytes passed from the userspace buffer to protect
against buffer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54102 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
