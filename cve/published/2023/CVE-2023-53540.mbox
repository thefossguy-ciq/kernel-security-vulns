Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: reject auth/assoc to AP with our address

If the AP uses our own address as its MLD address or BSSID, then
clearly something's wrong. Reject such connections so we don't
try and fail later.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53540 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
