Subject: CVE-2023-54143: media: mediatek: vcodec: fix resource leaks in vdec_msg_queue_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: fix resource leaks in vdec_msg_queue_init()

If we encounter any error in the vdec_msg_queue_init() then we need
to set "msg_queue->wdma_addr.size = 0;".  Normally, this is done
inside the vdec_msg_queue_deinit() function.  However, if the
first call to allocate &msg_queue->wdma_addr fails, then the
vdec_msg_queue_deinit() function is a no-op.  For that situation, just
set the size to zero explicitly and return.

There were two other error paths which did not clean up before returning.
Change those error paths to goto mem_alloc_err.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54143 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
