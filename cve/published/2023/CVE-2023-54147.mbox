Subject: CVE-2023-54147: media: platform: mtk-mdp3: Add missing check and free for ida_alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: platform: mtk-mdp3: Add missing check and free for ida_alloc

Add the check for the return value of the ida_alloc in order to avoid
NULL pointer dereference.
Moreover, free allocated "ctx->id" if mdp_m2m_open fails later in order
to avoid memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
