Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: synchronize atomic write aborts

To fix a race condition between atomic write aborts, I use the inode
lock and make COW inode to be re-usable thoroughout the whole
atomic file inode lifetime.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
