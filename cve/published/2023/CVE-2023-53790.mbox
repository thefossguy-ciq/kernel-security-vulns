Subject: CVE-2023-53790: bpf: Zeroing allocated object from slab in bpf memory allocator

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Zeroing allocated object from slab in bpf memory allocator

Currently the freed element in bpf memory allocator may be immediately
reused, for htab map the reuse will reinitialize special fields in map
value (e.g., bpf_spin_lock), but lookup procedure may still access
these special fields, and it may lead to hard-lockup as shown below:

 NMI backtrace for cpu 16
 CPU: 16 PID: 2574 Comm: htab.bin Tainted: G             L     6.1.0+ #1
 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996),
 RIP: 0010:queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x283/0x2c0

 Call Trace:

  </TASK>

For htab map, just like the preallocated case, these is no need to
initialize these special fields in map value again once these fields
have been initialized. For preallocated htab map, these fields are
initialized through __GFP_ZERO in bpf_map_area_alloc(), so do the
similar thing for non-preallocated htab in bpf memory allocator. And
there is no need to use __GFP_ZERO for per-cpu bpf memory allocator,
because __alloc_percpu_gfp() does it implicitly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53790 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/678ea18d6240299fd77d7000c8b1d7e5f274c8af
