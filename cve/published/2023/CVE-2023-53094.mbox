Subject: CVE-2023-53094: tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: fix race on RX DMA shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: fix race on RX DMA shutdown

From time to time DMA completion can come in the middle of DMA shutdown:

<process ctx>:				<IRQ>:
lpuart32_shutdown()
  lpuart_dma_shutdown()
    del_timer_sync()
					lpuart_dma_rx_complete()
					  lpuart_copy_rx_to_tty()
					    mod_timer()
    lpuart_dma_rx_free()

When the timer fires a bit later, sport->dma_rx_desc is NULL:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000004
pc : lpuart_copy_rx_to_tty+0xcc/0x5bc
lr : lpuart_timer_func+0x1c/0x2c
Call trace:
 lpuart_copy_rx_to_tty
 lpuart_timer_func
 call_timer_fn
 __run_timers.part.0
 run_timer_softirq
 __do_softirq
 __irq_exit_rcu
 irq_exit
 handle_domain_irq
 gic_handle_irq
 call_on_irq_stack
 do_interrupt_handler
 ...

To fix this fold del_timer_sync() into lpuart_dma_rx_free() after
dmaengine_terminate_sync() to make sure timer will not be re-started in
lpuart_copy_rx_to_tty() <= lpuart_dma_rx_complete().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
