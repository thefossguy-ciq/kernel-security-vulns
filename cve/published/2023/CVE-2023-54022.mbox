Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential memory leaks at error path for UMP open

The allocation and initialization errors at alloc_midi_urbs() that is
called at MIDI 2.0 / UMP device are supposed to be handled at the
caller side by invoking free_midi_urbs().  However, free_midi_urbs()
loops only for ep->num_urbs entries, and since ep->num_entries wasn't
updated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this
entry won't be released.

The intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so
change the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing
the missed releases.

Also, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at
snd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at
reopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at
the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54022 to this issue.

==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	sound/usb/midi2.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f819b343aa95d24d5f7d6e06660c7f62591abc5f
