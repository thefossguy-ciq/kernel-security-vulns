Subject: CVE-2023-53520: Bluetooth: Fix hci_suspend_sync crash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Fix hci_suspend_sync crash

If hci_unregister_dev() frees the hci_dev object but hci_suspend_notifier
may still be accessing it, it can cause the program to crash.
Here's the call trace:

This patch holds the reference count of the hci_dev object while
processing it in hci_suspend_notifier to avoid potential crash
caused by the race condition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53520 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
