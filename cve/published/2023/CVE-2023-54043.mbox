Subject: CVE-2023-54043: iommufd: Do not add the same hwpt to the ioas->hwpt_list twice

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Do not add the same hwpt to the ioas->hwpt_list twice

The hwpt is added to the hwpt_list only during its creation, it is never
added again. This hunk is some missed leftover from rework. Adding it
twice will corrupt the linked list in some cases.

It effects HWPT specific attachment, which is something the test suite
cannot cover until we can create a legitimate struct device with a
non-system iommu "driver" (ie we need the bus removed from the iommu code)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54043 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c44adefdcf472f946f0632f4e0ddcbf3e00b8516
