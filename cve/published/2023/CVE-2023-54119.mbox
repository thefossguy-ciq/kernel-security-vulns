Subject: CVE-2023-54119: inotify: Avoid reporting event with invalid wd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inotify: Avoid reporting event with invalid wd

When inotify_freeing_mark() races with inotify_handle_inode_event() it
can happen that inotify_handle_inode_event() sees that i_mark->wd got
already reset to -1 and reports this value to userspace which can
confuse the inotify listener. Avoid the problem by validating that wd is
sensible (and pretend the mark got removed before the event got
generated otherwise).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54119 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
