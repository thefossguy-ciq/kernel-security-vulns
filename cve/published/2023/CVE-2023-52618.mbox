Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow

Since "dev_search_path" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX,
there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string
into "full_path" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were
reporting this warning:

drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c: In function 'process_msg_open.isra':
drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:51: warning: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 254 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Wformat-truncation=]
  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s",
      |                                                   ^~
In function 'rnbd_srv_get_full_path',
    inlined from 'process_msg_open.isra' at drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:721:14: drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:17: note: 'snprintf' output between 2 and 4351 bytes into a destination of size 4096
  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s",
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  617 |                          dev_search_path, dev_name);
      |                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To fix this, unconditionally check for truncation (as was already done
for the case where "%SESSNAME%" was present).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52618 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
