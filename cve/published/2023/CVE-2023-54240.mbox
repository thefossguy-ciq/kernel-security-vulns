Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in mtk_hwlro_get_fdir_all()

rule_locs is allocated in ethtool_get_rxnfc and the size is determined by
rule_cnt from user space. So rule_cnt needs to be check before using
rule_locs to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54240 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
