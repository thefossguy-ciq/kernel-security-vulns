Subject: CVE-2023-54050: ubifs: Fix memleak when insert_old_idx() failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Fix memleak when insert_old_idx() failed

Following process will cause a memleak for copied up znode:

dirty_cow_znode
  zn = copy_znode(c, znode);
  err = insert_old_idx(c, zbr->lnum, zbr->offs);
  if (unlikely(err))
     return ERR_PTR(err);   // No one refers to zn.

Fetch a reproducer in [Link].

Function copy_znode() is split into 2 parts: resource allocation
and znode replacement, insert_old_idx() is split in similar way,
so resource cleanup could be done in error handling path without
corrupting metadata(mem & disk).
It's okay that old index inserting is put behind of add_idx_dirt(),
old index is used in layout_leb_in_gaps(), so the two processes do
not depend on each other.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
