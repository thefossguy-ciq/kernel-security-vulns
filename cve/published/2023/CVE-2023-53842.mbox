Subject: CVE-2023-53842: ASoC: codecs: wcd-mbhc-v2: fix resource leaks on component remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd-mbhc-v2: fix resource leaks on component remove

The MBHC resources must be released on component probe failure and
removal so can not be tied to the lifetime of the component device.

This is specifically needed to allow probe deferrals of the sound card
which otherwise fails when reprobing the codec component:

    snd-sc8280xp sound: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -517
    genirq: Flags mismatch irq 299. 00002001 (mbhc sw intr) vs. 00002001 (mbhc sw intr)
    wcd938x_codec audio-codec: Failed to request mbhc interrupts -16
    wcd938x_codec audio-codec: mbhc initialization failed
    wcd938x_codec audio-codec: ASoC: error at snd_soc_component_probe on audio-codec: -16
    snd-sc8280xp sound: ASoC: failed to instantiate card -16

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
