Subject: CVE-2023-53246: cifs: fix DFS traversal oops without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix DFS traversal oops without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL

When compiled with CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL disabled, cifs_dfs_d_automount
is NULL. cifs.ko logic for mapping CIFS_FATTR_DFS_REFERRAL attributes to
S_AUTOMOUNT and corresponding dentry flags is retained regardless of
CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in
VFS follow_automount() when traversing a DFS referral link:
  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
  ...
  Call Trace:

This fix adds an inline cifs_dfs_d_automount() {return -EREMOTE} handler
when CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL is disabled. An alternative would be to
avoid flagging S_AUTOMOUNT, etc. without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL. This
approach was chosen as it provides more control over the error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53246 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
