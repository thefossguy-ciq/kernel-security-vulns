Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: qup: Don't skip cleanup in remove's error path

Returning early in a platform driver's remove callback is wrong. In this
case the dma resources are not released in the error path. this is never
retried later and so this is a permanent leak. To fix this, only skip
hardware disabling if waking the device fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53567 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
