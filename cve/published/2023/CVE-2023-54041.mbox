Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix memory leak when removing provided buffers

When removing provided buffers, io_buffer structs are not being disposed
of, leading to a memory leak. They can't be freed individually, because
they are allocated in page-sized groups. They need to be added to some
free list instead, such as io_buffers_cache. All callers already hold
the lock protecting it, apart from when destroying buffers, so had to
extend the lock there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54041 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	io_uring/io_uring.c
	io_uring/kbuf.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac48787f58d1068f4e06d627c1135784d64b4c72
