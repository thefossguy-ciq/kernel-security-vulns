Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix NULL pointer dereference on fastopen early fallback

In case of early fallback to TCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock() deletes
the subflow context before returning the newly allocated sock to
the caller.

The fastopen path does not cope with the above unconditionally
dereferencing the subflow context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95135835519b0ab931c39908b2c99e9fb3c9068b
