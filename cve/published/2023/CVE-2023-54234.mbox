Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix missing mrioc->evtack_cmds initialization

Commit c1af985d27da ("scsi: mpi3mr: Add Event acknowledgment logic")
introduced an array mrioc->evtack_cmds but initialization of the array
elements was missed. They are just zero cleared. The function
mpi3mr_complete_evt_ack() refers host_tag field of the elements. Due to the
zero value of the host_tag field, the function calls clear_bit() for
mrico->evtack_cmds_bitmap with wrong bit index. This results in memory
access to invalid address and "BUG: KASAN: use-after-free". This BUG was
observed at eHBA-9600 firmware update to version 8.3.1.0. To fix it, add
the missing initialization of mrioc->evtack_cmds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
