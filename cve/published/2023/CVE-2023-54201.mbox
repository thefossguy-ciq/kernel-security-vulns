Subject: CVE-2023-54201: RDMA/efa: Fix wrong resources deallocation order

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/efa: Fix wrong resources deallocation order

When trying to destroy QP or CQ, we first decrease the refcount and
potentially free memory regions allocated for the object and then
request the device to destroy the object. If the device fails, the
object isn't fully destroyed so the user/IB core can try to destroy the
object again which will lead to underflow when trying to decrease an
already zeroed refcount.

Deallocate resources in reverse order of allocating them to safely free
them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54201 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
