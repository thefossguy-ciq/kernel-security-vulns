Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid5-cache: fix a deadlock in r5l_exit_log()

Commit b13015af94cf ("md/raid5-cache: Clear conf->log after finishing
work") introduce a new problem:

// caller hold reconfig_mutex
r5l_exit_log
 flush_work(&log->disable_writeback_work)
			r5c_disable_writeback_async
			 wait_event
			  /*
			   * conf->log is not NULL, and mddev_trylock()
			   * will fail, wait_event() can never pass.
			   */
 conf->log = NULL

Fix this problem by setting 'config->log' to NULL before wake_up() as it
used to be, so that wait_event() from r5c_disable_writeback_async() can
exist. In the meantime, move forward md_unregister_thread() so that
null-ptr-deref this commit fixed can still be fixed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
