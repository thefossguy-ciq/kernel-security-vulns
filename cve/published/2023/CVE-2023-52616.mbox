Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init

When the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized, some fields are not
cleared, causing a crash when referencing the field when the
structure was released. Initially, this issue was ignored because
memory for mpi_ec_ctx is allocated with the __GFP_ZERO flag.
For example, this error will be triggered when calculating the
Za value for SM2 separately.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52616 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
