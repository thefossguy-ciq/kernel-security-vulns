Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: mediatek: fix race conditions with genpd

If the power domains are registered first with genpd and *after that*
the driver attempts to power them on in the probe sequence, then it is
possible that a race condition occurs if genpd tries to power them on
in the same time.
The same is valid for powering them off before unregistering them
from genpd.
Attempt to fix race conditions by first removing the domains from genpd
and *after that* powering down domains.
Also first power up the domains and *after that* register them
to genpd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52645 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
