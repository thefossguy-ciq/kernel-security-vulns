Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid potential memory corruption in __update_iostat_latency()

Add iotype sanity check to avoid potential memory corruption.
This is to fix the compile error below:

fs/f2fs/iostat.c:231 __update_iostat_latency() error: buffer overflow
'io_lat->peak_lat[type]' 3 <= 3

vim +228 fs/f2fs/iostat.c

  211  static inline void __update_iostat_latency(struct bio_iostat_ctx
	*iostat_ctx,
  212					enum iostat_lat_type type)
  213  {
  214		unsigned long ts_diff;
  215		unsigned int page_type = iostat_ctx->type;
  216		struct f2fs_sb_info *sbi = iostat_ctx->sbi;
  217		struct iostat_lat_info *io_lat = sbi->iostat_io_lat;
  218		unsigned long flags;
  219
  220		if (!sbi->iostat_enable)
  221			return;
  222
  223		ts_diff = jiffies - iostat_ctx->submit_ts;
  224		if (page_type >= META_FLUSH)
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^

  225			page_type = META;
  226
  227		spin_lock_irqsave(&sbi->iostat_lat_lock, flags);
 @228		io_lat->sum_lat[type][page_type] += ts_diff;
                                      ^^^^^^^^^
Mixup between META_FLUSH and NR_PAGE_TYPE leads to memory corruption.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53214 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
