Subject: CVE-2023-53694: riscv: ftrace: Fixup panic by disabling preemption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: ftrace: Fixup panic by disabling preemption

In RISCV, we must use an AUIPC + JALR pair to encode an immediate,
forming a jump that jumps to an address over 4K. This may cause errors
if we want to enable kernel preemption and remove dependency from
patching code with stop_machine(). For example, if a task was switched
out on auipc. And, if we changed the ftrace function before it was
switched back, then it would jump to an address that has updated 11:0
bits mixing with previous XLEN:12 part.

p: patched area performed by dynamic ftrace
ftrace_prologue:
p|      REG_S   ra, -SZREG(sp)

					...
p|      jalr    -?(ra) <------------- switched back
p|      REG_L   ra, -SZREG(sp)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
