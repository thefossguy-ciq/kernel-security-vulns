Subject: CVE-2023-53376: scsi: mpi3mr: Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Use number of bits to manage bitmap sizes

To allocate bitmaps, the mpi3mr driver calculates sizes of bitmaps using
byte as unit. However, bitmap helper functions assume that bitmaps are
allocated using unsigned long as unit. This gap causes memory access beyond
the bitmap sizes and results in "BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds".  The BUG
was observed at firmware download to eHBA-9600. Call trace indicated that
the out-of-bounds access happened in find_first_zero_bit() called from
mpi3mr_send_event_ack() for miroc->evtack_cmds_bitmap.

To fix the BUG, do not use bytes to manage bitmap sizes. Instead, use
number of bits, and call bitmap helper functions which take number of bits
as arguments. For memory allocation, call bitmap_zalloc() instead of
kzalloc() and krealloc(). For memory free, call bitmap_free() instead of
kfree(). For zero clear, call bitmap_clear() instead of memset().

Remove three fields for bitmap byte sizes in struct scmd_priv which are no
longer required. Replace the field dev_handle_bitmap_sz with
dev_handle_bitmap_bits to keep number of bits of removepend_bitmap across
resize.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53376 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
