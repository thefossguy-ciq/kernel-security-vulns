Subject: CVE-2023-54247: bpf: Silence a warning in btf_type_id_size()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Silence a warning in btf_type_id_size()

syzbot reported a warning in [1] with the following stacktrace:
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5005 at kernel/bpf/btf.c:1988 btf_type_id_size+0x2d9/0x9d0 kernel/bpf/btf.c:1988

   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd

With the following btf
  [1] DECL_TAG 'a' type_id=4 component_idx=-1
  [2] PTR '(anon)' type_id=0
  [3] TYPE_TAG 'a' type_id=2
  [4] VAR 'a' type_id=3, linkage=static
and when the bpf_attr.btf_key_type_id = 1 (DECL_TAG),
the following WARN_ON_ONCE in btf_type_id_size() is triggered:
  if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!btf_type_is_modifier(size_type) &&
                   !btf_type_is_var(size_type)))
          return NULL;

Note that 'return NULL' is the correct behavior as we don't want
a DECL_TAG type to be used as a btf_{key,value}_type_id even
for the case like 'DECL_TAG -> STRUCT'. So there
is no correctness issue here, we just want to silence warning.

To silence the warning, I added DECL_TAG as one of kinds in
btf_type_nosize() which will cause btf_type_id_size() returning
NULL earlier without the warning.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
