Subject: CVE-2023-54324: dm: fix a race condition in retrieve_deps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: fix a race condition in retrieve_deps

There's a race condition in the multipath target when retrieve_deps
races with multipath_message calling dm_get_device and dm_put_device.
retrieve_deps walks the list of open devices without holding any lock
but multipath may add or remove devices to the list while it is
running. The end result may be memory corruption or use-after-free
memory access.

See this description of a UAF with multipath_message():
https://listman.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2022-October/052373.html

Fix this bug by introducing a new rw semaphore "devices_lock". We grab
devices_lock for read in retrieve_deps and we grab it for write in
dm_get_device and dm_put_device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54324 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
