Subject: CVE-2023-53828: Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_add_adv_monitor()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Avoid use-after-free in dbg for hci_add_adv_monitor()

KSAN reports use-after-free in hci_add_adv_monitor().

While adding an adv monitor,
    hci_add_adv_monitor() calls ->
    msft_add_monitor_pattern() calls ->
    msft_add_monitor_sync() calls ->
    msft_le_monitor_advertisement_cb() calls in an error case ->
    hci_free_adv_monitor() which frees the *moniter.

This is referenced by bt_dev_dbg() in hci_add_adv_monitor().

Fix the bt_dev_dbg() by using handle instead of monitor->handle.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
