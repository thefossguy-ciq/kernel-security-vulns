Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Block switchdev mode when ADQ is active and vice versa

ADQ and switchdev are not supported simultaneously. Enabling both at the
same time can result in nullptr dereference.

To prevent this, check if ADQ is active when changing devlink mode to
switchdev mode, and check if switchdev is active when enabling ADQ.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53442 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
