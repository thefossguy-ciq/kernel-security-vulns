Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Fix memory leak of PBLE objects

On rmmod of irdma, the PBLE object memory is not being freed. PBLE object
memory are not statically pre-allocated at function initialization time
unlike other HMC objects. PBLEs objects and the Segment Descriptors (SD)
for it can be dynamically allocated during scale up and SD's remain
allocated till function deinitialization.

Fix this leak by adding IRDMA_HMC_IW_PBLE to the iw_hmc_obj_types[] table
and skip pbles in irdma_create_hmc_obj but not in irdma_del_hmc_objects().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
