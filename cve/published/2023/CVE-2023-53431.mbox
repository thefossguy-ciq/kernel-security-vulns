Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ses: Don't attach if enclosure has no components

An enclosure with no components can't usefully be operated by the driver
(since effectively it has nothing to manage), so report the problem and
don't attach. Not attaching also fixes an oops which could occur if the
driver tries to manage a zero component enclosure.

[mkp: Switched to KERN_WARNING since this scenario is common]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53431 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
