Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sev: Make enc_dec_hypercall() accept a size instead of npages

enc_dec_hypercall() accepted a page count instead of a size, which
forced its callers to round up. As a result, non-page aligned
vaddrs caused pages to be spuriously marked as decrypted via the
encryption status hypercall, which in turn caused consistent
corruption of pages during live migration. Live migration requires
accurate encryption status information to avoid migrating pages
from the wrong perspective.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
