Subject: CVE-2023-53803: scsi: ses: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in ses_enclosure_data_process()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ses: Fix slab-out-of-bounds in ses_enclosure_data_process()

A fix for:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ses_enclosure_data_process+0x949/0xe30 [ses]
Read of size 1 at addr ffff88a1b043a451 by task systemd-udevd/3271

Checking after (and before in next loop) addl_desc_ptr[1] is sufficient, we
expect the size to be sanitized before first access to addl_desc_ptr[1].
Make sure we don't walk beyond end of page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53803 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
