Subject: CVE-2023-53791: md: fix warning for holder mismatch from export_rdev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: fix warning for holder mismatch from export_rdev()

Commit a1d767191096 ("md: use mddev->external to select holder in
export_rdev()") fix the problem that 'claim_rdev' is used for
blkdev_get_by_dev() while 'rdev' is used for blkdev_put().

However, if mddev->external is changed from 0 to 1, then 'rdev' is used
for blkdev_get_by_dev() while 'claim_rdev' is used for blkdev_put(). And
this problem can be reporduced reliably by following:

New file: mdadm/tests/23rdev-lifetime

devname=${dev0##*/}
devt=`cat /sys/block/$devname/dev`
pid=""
runtime=2

clean_up_test() {
        pill -9 $pid
        echo clear > /sys/block/md0/md/array_state
}

trap 'clean_up_test' EXIT

add_by_sysfs() {
        while true; do
                echo $devt > /sys/block/md0/md/new_dev
        done
}

remove_by_sysfs(){
        while true; do
                echo remove > /sys/block/md0/md/dev-${devname}/state
        done
}

echo md0 > /sys/module/md_mod/parameters/new_array || die "create md0 failed"

add_by_sysfs &
pid="$pid $!"

remove_by_sysfs &
pid="$pid $!"

sleep $runtime
exit 0

Test cmd:

./test --save-logs --logdir=/tmp/ --keep-going --dev=loop --tests=23rdev-lifetime

Test result:

Fix the problem by recording if 'rdev' is used as holder.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/99fcd427178d0f58f5520f8f01df727f8eaeb2c7
