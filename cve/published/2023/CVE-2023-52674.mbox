Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: scarlett2: Add clamp() in scarlett2_mixer_ctl_put()

Ensure the value passed to scarlett2_mixer_ctl_put() is between 0 and
SCARLETT2_MIXER_MAX_VALUE so we don't attempt to access outside
scarlett2_mixer_values[].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52674 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
