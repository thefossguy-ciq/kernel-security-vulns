Subject: CVE-2023-53794: cifs: fix session state check in reconnect to avoid use-after-free issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix session state check in reconnect to avoid use-after-free issue

Don't collect exiting session in smb2_reconnect_server(), because it
will be released soon.

Note that the exiting session will stay in server->smb_ses_list until
it complete the cifs_free_ipc() and logoff() and then delete itself
from the list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53794 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e4f5c3f01fb0e51ca438e43262d858daf9a0a76
