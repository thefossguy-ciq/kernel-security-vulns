Subject: CVE-2023-53395: ACPICA: Add AML_NO_OPERAND_RESOLVE flag to Timer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: Add AML_NO_OPERAND_RESOLVE flag to Timer

ACPICA commit 90310989a0790032f5a0140741ff09b545af4bc5

According to the ACPI specification 19.6.134, no argument is required to be passed for ASL Timer instruction. For taking care of no argument, AML_NO_OPERAND_RESOLVE flag is added to ASL Timer instruction opcode.

When ASL timer instruction interpreted by ACPI interpreter, getting error. After adding AML_NO_OPERAND_RESOLVE flag to ASL Timer instruction opcode, issue is not observed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
