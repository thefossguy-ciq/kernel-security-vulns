Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/habanalabs: postpone mem_mgr IDR destruction to hpriv_release()

The memory manager IDR is currently destroyed when user releases the
file descriptor.
However, at this point the user context might be still held, and memory
buffers might be still in use.
Later on, calls to release those buffers will fail due to not finding
their handles in the IDR, leading to a memory leak.
To avoid this leak, split the IDR destruction from the memory manager
fini, and postpone it to hpriv_release() when there is no user context
and no buffers are used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53353 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.3.4 with commit 840de329ca99cafd0cdde9c6ac160b1330942aba
	Fixed in 6.4 with commit 2e8e9a895c4589f124a37fc84d123b5114406e94

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53353
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/840de329ca99cafd0cdde9c6ac160b1330942aba
