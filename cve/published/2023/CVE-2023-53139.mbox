Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fdp: add null check of devm_kmalloc_array in fdp_nci_i2c_read_device_properties

devm_kmalloc_array may fails, *fw_vsc_cfg might be null and cause
out-of-bounds write in device_property_read_u8_array later.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53139 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
