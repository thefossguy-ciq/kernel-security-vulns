Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of/fdt: run soc memory setup when early_init_dt_scan_memory fails

If memory has been found early_init_dt_scan_memory now returns 1. If
it hasn't found any memory it will return 0, allowing other memory
setup mechanisms to carry on.

Previously early_init_dt_scan_memory always returned 0 without
distinguishing between any kind of memory setup being done or not. Any
code path after the early_init_dt_scan memory call in the ramips
plat_mem_setup code wouldn't be executed anymore. Making
early_init_dt_scan_memory the only way to initialize the memory.

Some boards, including my mt7621 based Cudy X6 board, depend on memory
initialization being done via the soc_info.mem_detect function
pointer. Those wouldn't be able to obtain memory and panic the kernel
during early bootup with the message "early_init_dt_alloc_memory_arch:
Failed to allocate 12416 bytes align=0x40".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53341 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04836fc5b720dfa32ff781383d84f63019abf9b9
