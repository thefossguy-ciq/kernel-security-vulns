Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: don't call rq_qos_ops->done_bio if the bio isn't tracked

rq_qos framework is only applied on request based driver, so:

1) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio based driver

2) rq_qos_done_bio() needn't to be called for bio which isn't tracked,
such as bios ended from error handling code.

Especially in bio_endio():

1) request queue is referred via bio->bi_bdev->bd_disk->queue, which
may be gone since request queue refcount may not be held in above two
cases

2) q->rq_qos may be freed in blk_cleanup_queue() when calling into
__rq_qos_done_bio()

Fix the potential kernel panic by not calling rq_qos_ops->done_bio if
the bio isn't tracked. This way is safe because both ioc_rqos_done_bio()
and blkcg_iolatency_done_bio() are nop if the bio isn't tracked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47412 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.14.11 with commit 004b8f8a6912
	Fixed in 5.15 with commit a647a524a467

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
