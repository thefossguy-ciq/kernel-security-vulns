Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: fix Use-after-Free, hold skb ref while in use

This patch fixes a Use-after-Free found by the syzbot.

The problem is that a skb is taken from the per-session skb queue,
without incrementing the ref count. This leads to a Use-after-Free if
the skb is taken concurrently from the session queue due to a CTS.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47232 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
