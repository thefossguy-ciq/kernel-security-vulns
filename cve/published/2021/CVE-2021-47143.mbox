Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: remove device from smcd_dev_list after failed device_add()

If the device_add() for a smcd_dev fails, there's no cleanup step that
rolls back the earlier list_add(). The device subsequently gets freed,
and we end up with a corrupted list.

Add some error handling that removes the device from the list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47143 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
