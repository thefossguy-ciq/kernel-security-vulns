Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: virtio: disable timeout handling

If a timeout is hit, it can result is incorrect data on the I2C bus
and/or memory corruptions in the guest since the device can still be
operating on the buffers it was given while the guest has freed them.

Here is, for example, the start of a slub_debug splat which was
triggered on the next transfer after one transfer was forced to timeout
by setting a breakpoint in the backend (rust-vmm/vhost-device):

 BUG kmalloc-1k (Not tainted): Poison overwritten

 	vfs_ioctl+0x21/0x30

There is no simple fix for this (the driver would have to always create
bounce buffers and hold on to them until the device eventually returns
the buffers), so just disable the timeout support for now.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47561 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.15 with commit 3cfc88380413 and fixed in 5.15.6 with commit cc432b0727ce

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2021-47561
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-virtio.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc432b0727ce404cc13e8f6b5ce29f412c3f9f1f
