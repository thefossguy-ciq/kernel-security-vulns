Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: wcd934x: Fix shift-out-of-bounds error

bit-mask for pins 0 to 4 is BIT(0) to BIT(4) however we ended up with BIT(n - 1)
which is not right, and this was caught by below usban check

UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in drivers/gpio/gpio-wcd934x.c:34:14

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47263 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
