Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix ltout double free on completion race

Always remove linked timeout on io_link_timeout_fn() from the master
request link list, otherwise we may get use-after-free when first
io_link_timeout_fn() puts linked timeout in the fail path, and then
will be found and put on master's free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47123 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
