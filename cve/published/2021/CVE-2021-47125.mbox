Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_htb: fix refcount leak in htb_parent_to_leaf_offload

The commit ae81feb7338c ("sch_htb: fix null pointer dereference
on a null new_q") fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug, but it
is not correct.

Because htb_graft_helper properly handles the case when new_q
is NULL, and after the previous patch by skipping this call
which creates an inconsistency : dev_queue->qdisc will still
point to the old qdisc, but cl->parent->leaf.q will point to
the new one (which will be noop_qdisc, because new_q was NULL).
The code is based on an assumption that these two pointers are
the same, so it can lead to refcount leaks.

The correct fix is to add a NULL pointer check to protect
qdisc_refcount_inc inside htb_parent_to_leaf_offload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47125 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2411c02d03892a5057499f8102d0cc1e0f852416
