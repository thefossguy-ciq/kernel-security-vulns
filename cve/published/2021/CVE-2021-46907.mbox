Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Don't use vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an array index

__vmx_handle_exit() uses vcpu->run->internal.ndata as an index for
an array access.  Since vcpu->run is (can be) mapped to a user address
space with a writer permission, the 'ndata' could be updated by the
user process at anytime (the user process can set it to outside the
bounds of the array).
So, it is not safe that __vmx_handle_exit() uses the 'ndata' that way.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46907 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f64753835a78c7d2cc2932a5808ef3b7fd4c050
