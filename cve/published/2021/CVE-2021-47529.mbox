Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iwlwifi: Fix memory leaks in error handling path

memory already allocated in 'reduce_power_data' should be freed before
returning, otherwise it is leaking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47529 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.14 with commit 9dad325f9d57 and fixed in 5.15.7 with commit 4768935c2540

	drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/fw/uefi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4768935c25403ba96e7a745645df24a51a774b7e
