Subject: CVE-2021-47340: jfs: fix GPF in diFree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix GPF in diFree

Avoid passing inode with
JFS_SBI(inode->i_sb)->ipimap == NULL to
diFree()[1]. GFP will appear:

	struct inode *ipimap = JFS_SBI(ip->i_sb)->ipimap;
	struct inomap *imap = JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap;

JFS_IP() will return invalid pointer when ipimap == NULL

Call Trace:
 diFree+0x13d/0x2dc0 fs/jfs/jfs_imap.c:853 [1]
 jfs_evict_inode+0x2c9/0x370 fs/jfs/inode.c:154

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
