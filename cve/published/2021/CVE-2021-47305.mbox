Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-buf/sync_file: Don't leak fences on merge failure

Each add_fence() call does a dma_fence_get() on the relevant fence.  In
the error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences
got leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't
freeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always
zero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on
every error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47305 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
