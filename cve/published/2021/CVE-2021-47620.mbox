Subject: CVE-2021-47620: Bluetooth: refactor malicious adv data check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: refactor malicious adv data check

Check for out-of-bound read was being performed at the end of while
num_reports loop, and would fill journal with false positives. Added
check to beginning of loop processing so that it doesn't get checked
after ptr has been advanced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47620 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
