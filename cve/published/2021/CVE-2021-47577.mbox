Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io-wq: check for wq exit after adding new worker task_work

We check IO_WQ_BIT_EXIT before attempting to create a new worker, and
wq exit cancels pending work if we have any. But it's possible to have
a race between the two, where creation checks exit finding it not set,
but we're in the process of exiting. The exit side will cancel pending
creation task_work, but there's a gap where we add task_work after we've
canceled existing creations at exit time.

Fix this by checking the EXIT bit post adding the creation task_work.
If it's set, run the same cancelation that exit does.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47577 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.15.11 with commit 4b4e5bbf9386
	Fixed in 5.16 with commit 71a85387546e

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2021-47577
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/io-wq.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b4e5bbf9386d4ec21d91c0cb0fd60b9bba778ec
