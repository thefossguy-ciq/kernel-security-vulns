Subject: CVE-2021-47645: media: staging: media: zoran: calculate the right buffer number for zoran_reap_stat_com

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: staging: media: zoran: calculate the right buffer number for zoran_reap_stat_com

On the case tmp_dcim=1, the index of buffer is miscalculated.
This generate a NULL pointer dereference later.

So let's fix the calcul and add a check to prevent this to reappear.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47645 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
