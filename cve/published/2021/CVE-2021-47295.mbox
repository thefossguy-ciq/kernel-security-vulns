Subject: CVE-2021-47295: net: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work

Syzbot reported memory leak in tcindex_set_parms(). The problem was in
non-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work().

In tcindex_set_parms() new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from
old one are copied to new one, but not the perfect hash. Since
tcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old
tcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
