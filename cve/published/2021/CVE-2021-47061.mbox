Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Destroy I/O bus devices on unregister failure _after_ sync'ing SRCU

If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when unregistering a
device, wait to destroy the device until after all readers are guaranteed
to see the new null bus.  Destroying devices before the bus is nullified
could lead to use-after-free since readers expect the devices on their
reference of the bus to remain valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47061 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
