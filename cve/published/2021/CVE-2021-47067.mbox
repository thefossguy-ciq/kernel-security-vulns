Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc/tegra: regulators: Fix locking up when voltage-spread is out of range

Fix voltage coupler lockup which happens when voltage-spread is out
of range due to a bug in the code. The max-spread requirement shall be
accounted when CPU regulator doesn't have consumers. This problem is
observed on Tegra30 Ouya game console once system-wide DVFS is enabled
in a device-tree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47067 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
