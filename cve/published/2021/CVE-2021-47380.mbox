Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: amd_sfh: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

devm_add_action_or_reset() can suddenly invoke amd_mp2_pci_remove() at
registration that will cause NULL pointer dereference since
corresponding data is not initialized yet. The patch moves
initialization of data before devm_add_action_or_reset().

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/hid/amd-sfh-hid/amd_sfh_pcie.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
