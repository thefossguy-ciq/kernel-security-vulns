Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

batman-adv: Avoid WARN_ON timing related checks

The soft/batadv interface for a queued OGM can be changed during the time
the OGM was queued for transmission and when the OGM is actually
transmitted by the worker.

But WARN_ON must be used to denote kernel bugs and not to print simple
warnings. A warning can simply be printed using pr_warn.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47252 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
