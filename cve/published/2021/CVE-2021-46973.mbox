Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: qrtr: Avoid potential use after free in MHI send

It is possible that the MHI ul_callback will be invoked immediately
following the queueing of the skb for transmission, leading to the
callback decrementing the refcount of the associated sk and freeing the
skb.

As such the dereference of skb and the increment of the sk refcount must
happen before the skb is queued, to avoid the skb to be used after free
and potentially the sk to drop its last refcount..

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
