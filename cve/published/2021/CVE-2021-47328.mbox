Subject: CVE-2021-47328: scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets

If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.

We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
iscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session call
to remove the target and it's devices, and know after that point there is
no device or scsi-ml callout trying to access the session.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47328 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
