Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: free queued packets when closing socket

As reported by syzbot [1], there is a memory leak while closing the
socket. We partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b
("vsock/virtio: free packets during the socket release"), but we
forgot to drain the RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by
the scheduled work.

To avoid future issues, let's use the new virtio_transport_remove_sock()
to drain the RX queue before removing the socket from the af_vsock lists
calling vsock_remove_sock().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
