Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Use after free in __vmbus_open()

The "open_info" variable is added to the &vmbus_connection.chn_msg_list,
but the error handling frees "open_info" without removing it from the
list.  This will result in a use after free.  First remove it from the
list, and then free it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
