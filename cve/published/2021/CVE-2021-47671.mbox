Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: etas_es58x: es58x_rx_err_msg(): fix memory leak in error path

In es58x_rx_err_msg(), if can->do_set_mode() fails, the function
directly returns without calling netif_rx(skb). This means that the
skb previously allocated by alloc_can_err_skb() is not freed. In other
terms, this is a memory leak.

This patch simply removes the return statement in the error branch and
let the function continue.

Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for
details.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
