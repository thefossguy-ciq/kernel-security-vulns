Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning

If get_num_sdma_queues or get_num_xgmi_sdma_queues is 0, we end up
doing a shift operation where the number of bits shifted equals
number of bits in the operand. This behaviour is undefined.

Set num_sdma_queues or num_xgmi_sdma_queues to ULLONG_MAX, if the
count is >= number of bits in the operand.

Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1472

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-4460 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
