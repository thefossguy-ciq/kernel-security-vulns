Subject: CVE-2021-47182: USB: gadget: detect too-big endpoint 0 requests

Description
===========

USB: gadget: detect too-big endpoint 0 requests

Sometimes USB hosts can ask for buffers that are too large from endpoint
0, which should not be allowed.  If this happens for OUT requests, stall
the endpoint, but for IN requests, trim the request size to the endpoint
buffer size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47182 to this issue.

older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual change to resolve this
issue can be found at:
