Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: allow conditional reschedule for intensive iterators

If we have a lot of threads and rings, the tctx list can get quite big.
This is especially true if we keep creating new threads and rings.
Likewise for the provided buffers list. Be nice and insert a conditional
reschedule point while iterating the nodes for deletion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47411 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.14.11 with commit 648f59a06b0e
	Fixed in 5.15 with commit 8bab4c09f24e

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2021-47411
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/io_uring.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/648f59a06b0e1fec7a4158cdee9acd362e493ce1
