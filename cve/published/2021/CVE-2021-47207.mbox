Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: gus: fix null pointer dereference on pointer block

The pointer block return from snd_gf1_dma_next_block could be
null, so there is a potential null pointer dereference issue.
Fix this by adding a null check before dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47207 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
