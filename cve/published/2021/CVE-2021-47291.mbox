Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix another slab-out-of-bounds in fib6_nh_flush_exceptions

While running the self-tests on a KASAN enabled kernel, I observed a
slab-out-of-bounds splat very similar to the one reported in
commit 821bbf79fe46 ("ipv6: Fix KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds Read in
 fib6_nh_flush_exceptions").

We additionally need to take care of fib6_metrics initialization
failure when the caller provides an nh.

The fix is similar, explicitly free the route instead of calling
fib6_info_release on a half-initialized object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47291 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
