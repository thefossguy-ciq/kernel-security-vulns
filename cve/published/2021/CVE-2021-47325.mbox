Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Fix arm_smmu_device refcount leak in address translation

The reference counting issue happens in several exception handling paths
of arm_smmu_iova_to_phys_hard(). When those error scenarios occur, the
function forgets to decrease the refcount of "smmu" increased by
arm_smmu_rpm_get(), causing a refcount leak.

Fix this issue by jumping to "out" label when those error scenarios
occur.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47325 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
