Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

m68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits

Don't clear the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag
and counter overflow. As Michael reported, "This results in no timer
interrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs
in calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated."

On mvme16x, enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with
mvme147.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47016 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
