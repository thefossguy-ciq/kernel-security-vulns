Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ll_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used

With the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple and
efficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.
But in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments from
the skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not the
first.

Without this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the first
BD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit_done, and the
remaining BDs are still being processed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47224 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/xilinx/ll_temac_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
