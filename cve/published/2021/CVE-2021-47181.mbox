Subject: CVE-2021-47181: USB: gadget: bRequestType is a bitfield, not a enum

Description
===========

USB: gadget: bRequestType is a bitfield, not a enum

Szymon rightly pointed out that the previous check for the endpoint
direction in bRequestType was not looking at only the bit involved, but
rather the whole value.  Normally this is ok, but for some request
types, bits other than bit 8 could be set and the check for the endpoint
length could not stall correctly.

Fix that up by only checking the single bit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47181 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
