Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix an Oopsable condition in __nfs_pageio_add_request()

Ensure that nfs_pageio_error_cleanup() resets the mirror array contents,
so that the structure reflects the fact that it is now empty.
Also change the test in nfs_pageio_do_add_request() to be more robust by
checking whether or not the list is empty rather than relying on the
value of pg_count.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47167 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
