Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm rq: don't queue request to blk-mq during DM suspend

DM uses blk-mq's quiesce/unquiesce to stop/start device mapper queue.

But blk-mq's unquiesce may come from outside events, such as elevator
switch, updating nr_requests or others, and request may come during
suspend, so simply ask for blk-mq to requeue it.

Fixes one kernel panic issue when running updating nr_requests and
dm-mpath suspend/resume stress test.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47498 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.14.14 with commit 8ca9745efe35
	Fixed in 5.15 with commit b4459b11e840

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2021-47498
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/md/dm-rq.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ca9745efe3528feb06ca4e117188038eea2d351
