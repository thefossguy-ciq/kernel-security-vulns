Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-rdma: Fix NULL deref when SEND is completed with error

When running some traffic and taking down the link on peer, a
retry counter exceeded error is received. This leads to
nvmet_rdma_error_comp which tried accessing the cq_context to
obtain the queue. The cq_context is no longer valid after the
fix to use shared CQ mechanism and should be obtained similar
to how it is obtained in other functions from the wc->qp.

[ 905.786331] nvmet_rdma: SEND for CQE 0x00000000e3337f90 failed with status transport retry counter exceeded (12).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
