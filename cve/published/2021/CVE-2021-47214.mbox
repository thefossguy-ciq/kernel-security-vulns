Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hugetlb, userfaultfd: fix reservation restore on userfaultfd error

Currently in the is_continue case in hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte(), if we
bail out using "goto out_release_unlock;" in the cases where idx >=
size, or !huge_pte_none(), the code will detect that new_pagecache_page
== false, and so call restore_reserve_on_error().  In this case I see
restore_reserve_on_error() delete the reservation, and the following
call to remove_inode_hugepages() will increment h->resv_hugepages
causing a 100% reproducible leak.

We should treat the is_continue case similar to adding a page into the
pagecache and set new_pagecache_page to true, to indicate that there is
no reservation to restore on the error path, and we need not call
restore_reserve_on_error().  Rename new_pagecache_page to
page_in_pagecache to make that clear.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47214 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
