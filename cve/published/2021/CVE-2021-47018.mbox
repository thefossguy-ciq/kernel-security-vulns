Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/64: Fix the definition of the fixmap area

At the time being, the fixmap area is defined at the top of
the address space or just below KASAN.

This definition is not valid for PPC64.

For PPC64, use the top of the I/O space.

Because of circular dependencies, it is not possible to include
asm/fixmap.h in asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h , so define a fixed size
AREA at the top of the I/O space for fixmap and ensure during
build that the size is big enough.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47018 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/powerpc/include/asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h
	arch/powerpc/include/asm/fixmap.h
	arch/powerpc/include/asm/nohash/64/pgtable.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
