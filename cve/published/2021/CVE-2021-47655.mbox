Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: vdec: fixed possible memory leak issue

The venus_helper_alloc_dpb_bufs() implementation allows an early return
on an error path when checking the id from ida_alloc_min() which would
not release the earlier buffer allocation.

Move the direct kfree() from the error checking of dma_alloc_attrs() to
the common fail path to ensure that allocations are released on all
error paths in this function.

Addresses-Coverity: 1494120 ("Resource leak")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47655 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
