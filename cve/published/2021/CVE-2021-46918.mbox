Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: clear MSIX permission entry on shutdown

Add disabling/clearing of MSIX permission entries on device shutdown to
mirror the enabling of the MSIX entries on probe. Current code left the
MSIX enabled and the pasid entries still programmed at device shutdown.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46918 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.11 with commit 8e50d392652f and fixed in 5.11.16 with commit c84b8982d7aa

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
