Subject: CVE-2023-21660: fbdev: flush deferred IO before closing

Description
===========

fbdev: flush deferred IO before closing

When framebuffer gets closed, the queued deferred IO gets cancelled. This
can cause some last display data to vanish. This is problematic for users
who send a still image to the framebuffer, then close the file: the image
may never appear.

To ensure none of display data get lost, flush the queued deferred IO
first before closing.

Another possible solution is to delete the cancel_delayed_work_sync()
instead. The difference is that the display may appear some time after
closing. However, the clearing of page mapping after this needs to be
removed too, because the page mapping is used by the deferred work. It is
not completely obvious whether it is okay to not clear the page mapping.
For a patch intended for stable trees, go with the simple and obvious
solution.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-21660 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81f444f22816
