List of CVEs assigned to the Linux project.

They are in one of 4 states, that map directly to the subdirectories here:

	- reserved
		CVE identifer that we can use for a future issue as it has been
		assigned to our organization already.  This corresponds
		directly the RESERVED state of a identifier in the global CVE
		database.  When we run out, we will allocate new ones through
		the documented CVE api to do so.
	- published
		CVE identifier of a published issue.  Details for the issue are
		in the files, both a json format, and an email format, both are
		what we use to publish the needed information.  If the
		information changes, update the files and also update the
		global CVE database.
	- rejected
		CVE identifier that we have rejected.  The text in the
		identifier should explain the reasons.
	- returned
		CVE identifier that was previously reserved, but never actually
		used, so it was "rejected".  It can not be reused by any other
		orginization, but does not count against our quota of
		reserved-but-not-assigned cve ids.

See the file "schema" for more details about these directories and the contents
of the files in them.
