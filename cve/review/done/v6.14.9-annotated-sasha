bfb1d2b9021c2 arm64/mm: Check PUD_TYPE_TABLE in pud_bad()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code correctness/consistency improvement, not a security fix. The commit explicitly states it's about making `pud_bad()` perform consistent checks regardless of kernel configuration. 2. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit message describes this as making the check "always perform... regardless of the config" - it's about consistency, not fixing a vulnerability. 3. **Code analysis**: - Before: `pud_bad()` was defined as `!pud_table()`, but `pud_table()` was hard-coded to return `true` in certain configurations (64K pages or < 3 page table levels) - After: `pud_bad()` directly checks if `(pud_val(pud) & PUD_TYPE_MASK) != PUD_TYPE_TABLE` - This means in those specific configs, `pud_bad()` was always returning `false` (since `!true = false`), potentially missing actual bad PUD entries 4. **No exploitable condition**: While the previous behavior could theoretically miss detecting malformed PUD entries in specific configurations, there's no indication this creates an exploitable security vulnerability. The `pud_bad()` function is a sanity check used in debugging/error detection paths, not a security boundary. 5. **Similar commits comparison**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commits shown as examples (which fixed actual crashes, lockless walk issues, or file_map_count corruption), this commit is purely about making validation checks more consistent across configurations. The commit improves code robustness and debugging capabilities but doesn't address any security vulnerability or exploitable condition.
1062d81086156 iommufd: Disallow allocating nested parent domain with fault ID
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** CVE. **Explanation:** 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds a new validation check to prevent an unsupported configuration, but it's not fixing an existing security vulnerability. The code change adds: ```c + if ((flags & IOMMU_HWPT_FAULT_ID_VALID) && + (flags & IOMMU_HWPT_ALLOC_NEST_PARENT)) + return ERR_PTR(-EOPNOTSUPP); ``` 2. **Feature limitation, not security issue**: The commit message explicitly states this is disallowing a feature combination that lacks hardware support: "Some hardware lacks the capability to distinguish whether PRI occurs at stage 1 or stage 2." This is a functional limitation, not a security vulnerability. 3. **No existing exploitable condition**: The commit is proactively preventing a configuration that would be problematic due to hardware limitations. It's not fixing a condition that could be exploited for security purposes. 4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Added a domain owner check - a validation improvement - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): Extended drain functionality to cover RID faults - functional improvement - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Changed memory allocation flags from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL - optimization This commit follows the same pattern of adding validation/checks rather than fixing security vulnerabilities. 5. **Test-only changes**: Part of the changes are in the selftest file, adding test cases for the new validation, which further confirms this is a feature limitation rather than a security fix. The commit is adding defensive programming to prevent an unsupported configuration, which is good practice but doesn't constitute a security vulnerability fix that would warrant a CVE assignment.
062e8093592fb orangefs: Do not truncate file size
- [sasha] Let me examine this commit with the available information. The commit message states: "'len' is used to store the result of i_size_read(), so making 'len' a size_t results in truncation to 4GiB on 32-bit systems." Looking at the code changes: 1. In `orangefs_writepage_locked()`, `len` is changed from `size_t` to `loff_t` 2. In `orangefs_writepages_work()`, `len` and `off` are changed from `size_t`/undefined to `loff_t` The issue is that `i_size_read()` returns a `loff_t` (which is 64-bit), but it was being stored in a `size_t` variable. On 32-bit systems, `size_t` is only 32 bits, which means file sizes larger than 4GiB would be truncated to 4GiB. This is a clear data truncation bug that affects file operations on files larger than 4GiB on 32-bit systems. The truncation could lead to: - Data corruption when writing to files larger than 4GiB - Incorrect file size calculations - Potential data loss **Answer: YES** This commit fixes a security-relevant bug where file sizes were being truncated on 32-bit systems. The truncation of file sizes from 64-bit to 32-bit could lead to data corruption and loss when handling files larger than 4GiB on 32-bit systems. This is similar to the f2fs commits that received CVEs for fixing filesystem corruption issues. The bug allows unintended behavior that could compromise data integrity, making it a security vulnerability worthy of a CVE assignment.
07b5a2a13f470 pinctrl: bcm281xx: Use "unsigned int" instead of bare "unsigned"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Pure cosmetic change**: The commit explicitly states "No functional change" and only replaces bare "unsigned" with "unsigned int" to fix checkpatch warnings. In C, "unsigned" and "unsigned int" are exactly the same type - they are synonyms that compile to identical machine code. 2. **No security implications**: The changes are purely stylistic and do not affect: - Memory management or bounds checking - Access control or privilege handling - Data validation or input sanitization - Integer overflow/underflow behavior - Any security-sensitive operations 3. **Type equivalence confirmed**: As demonstrated by the test program, "unsigned" and "unsigned int" are the same type with identical size and behavior. The compiler treats them as completely equivalent. 4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the first three example commits which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they involve code refactoring, structure changes, or fixes that don't address security vulnerabilities. 5. **Checkpatch compliance only**: The sole purpose is to satisfy Linux kernel coding style guidelines enforced by the checkpatch tool, which prefers the explicit "unsigned int" form over bare "unsigned" for consistency. This is a pure code style cleanup with zero functional or security impact.
4cf364ca57d85 coresight: change coresight_trace_id_map's lock type to raw_spinlock_t
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I would say **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is converting a regular `spinlock_t` to a `raw_spinlock_t` for the `coresight_trace_id_map->lock`. This is a preventive measure to avoid potential lockdep issues in RT (real-time) kernels, not a fix for an actual security vulnerability. 2. **No current lockdep splat or bug**: Unlike the similar commits referenced (which show actual lockdep splats and "BUG: Invalid wait context" errors), this commit message indicates this is a proactive change. The commit message states "coresight_trace_id_map->lock **can be** acquired while coresight devices' drvdata_lock" (emphasis mine), suggesting this is addressing a potential issue rather than an actual bug. 3. **RT kernel compatibility**: The change is specifically to ensure compatibility with RT kernels where spinlocks are sleepable. In non-RT kernels, both spinlock_t and raw_spinlock_t behave the same way, so there's no security impact. 4. **Similar non-CVE commits**: Looking at the git history, I found similar coresight spinlock conversions (like commit 786eb82a36ef for coresight-etb10) that appear to be part of the same series and are also RT kernel compatibility changes rather than security fixes. 5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication of any exploitable condition, denial of service, or other security impact. This is purely a code correctness issue for RT kernel configurations. The change is a good practice to prevent potential issues when the coresight subsystem is used with RT kernels, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
7e76336e14de9 badblocks: Fix a nonsense WARN_ON() which checks whether a u64 variable < 0
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this specific commit more thoroughly: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is a code cleanup that fixes a nonsensical WARN_ON() condition, not a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **No Security Impact**: The original code had `WARN_ON(sectors < 0)` where `sectors` is of type `sector_t` (which is `u64`, an unsigned 64-bit integer). This condition could never be true since unsigned values cannot be negative. 2. **Pure Logic Fix**: The fix changes the WARN_ON to check `WARN_ON(sectors < len)` instead, which makes logical sense - it's checking for underflow before the subtraction `sectors -= len`. This is a correctness improvement, not a security fix. 3. **No Exploitable Vulnerability**: The original nonsensical WARN_ON would simply never trigger. There's no memory corruption, no information disclosure, no privilege escalation, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed. 4. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: This is similar to the historical commits shown that fix integer type issues (like commit d301f164c3fb about badblocks truncation) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". These are code quality improvements rather than security fixes. 5. **Warning Only**: WARN_ON() is a debugging aid that prints a warning but doesn't change program flow. The incorrect condition didn't cause any actual malfunction - it was just dead code that could never execute. The commit is purely a code cleanup to remove a logically impossible condition and replace it with a meaningful check that could actually detect programming errors during development.
2cadb8ef25a61 null_blk: generate null_blk configfs features string
- [sasha] Let me analyze the actual commit that was provided: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. The changes are purely cosmetic and functional improvements to the null_blk driver's configfs interface: 1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit generates the 'features' string dynamically instead of using a hardcoded constant. It iterates through the `nullb_device_attrs` table to concatenate feature names. 2. **No Security Impact**: - No memory corruption fixes - No access control changes - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes - The only functional change is adding the missing "index" feature to the string 3. **Code Analysis**: - The new code in `memb_group_features_show()` safely uses `snprintf()` with proper bounds checking - It includes overflow protection with the `WARN_ONCE` check - The alphabetical reordering of `nullb_device_attrs` is purely organizational 4. **Purpose**: This is a code quality improvement to: - Avoid checkpatch.pl warnings about split strings - Ensure the features list stays up-to-date automatically - Make the code more maintainable The commit explicitly states it's to avoid "WARNING: quoted string split across lines" and to prevent forgetting updates. There's no indication of any security issue being fixed.
ebedf8b7f05b9 wifi: iwlwifi: add support for Killer on MTL
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with the similar historical commits provided, I can now make a determination. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Hardware enablement only**: The commit merely adds two new PCI device ID entries (0x7F70 with subdevice IDs 0x1691 and 0x1692) to the existing device table. This is pure hardware enablement - adding support for new hardware variants. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes do not fix any security issue. They simply add device IDs to enable the Intel WiFi driver to recognize and support "Killer" branded WiFi adapters on MTL (likely Meteor Lake) platforms. 3. **Follows established pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, all of them also add device IDs or new hardware support configurations, and none were assigned CVEs. This is consistent with the practice that hardware enablement commits don't get CVEs. 4. **No behavior change for existing devices**: The changes only affect systems with the specific new device IDs being added. There's no modification to existing functionality that could introduce or fix security issues. 5. **Reference to feature request bug**: The commit references bug 219926, which appears to be a feature request for hardware support rather than a security issue. The commit is functionally identical to the similar commits shown (adding device IDs to iwl_dev_info_table or iwl_hw_card_ids), which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO". This is standard hardware enablement work in the iwlwifi driver.
83b28cfe79646 rcu: handle quiescent states for PREEMPT_RCU=n, PREEMPT_COUNT=y
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds support for a new kernel configuration combination (PREEMPT_LAZY=y, PREEMPT_DYNAMIC=n) that results in (PREEMPT_COUNT=y, PREEMPT_RCU=n). Without this patch, this specific configuration would not properly report RCU quiescent states, but this is not fixing an existing vulnerability - it's adding support for a new feature. 2. **New feature support**: The commit message clearly states it's handling a new configuration scenario that arises with PREEMPT_LAZY. The code change adds an additional condition to detect quiescent states when `CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT` is enabled but `PREEMPT_RCU` is not. 3. **No exploitation path**: The lack of proper quiescent state reporting in this specific configuration would potentially lead to RCU performance issues or possibly RCU stalls, but there's no indication this creates a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. 4. **Enhancement rather than bug fix**: The change enhances RCU's ability to detect quiescent states in a new configuration scenario. The comment update reflects this: "or while not holding the task preempt count (with PREEMPT_COUNT=y)". 5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them received CVEs despite dealing with RCU synchronization and quiescent state handling. They were all treated as correctness improvements or feature enhancements rather than security fixes. The commit is properly handling a new kernel configuration combination to ensure RCU works correctly, but it's not fixing a security vulnerability in existing code.
432051806f614 bpf: Make every prog keep a copy of ctx_arg_info
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it's a preparatory refactoring change that modifies how BPF programs manage ctx_arg_info data structures. Here's why: 1. **Not a security fix**: The commit explicitly states it's preparing for a future feature ("In the next patch where we support acquiring a referenced kptr..."). It's not fixing any existing vulnerability. 2. **Design improvement, not vulnerability fix**: The change converts ctx_arg_info from a shared read-only structure to per-program copies. This is an architectural improvement to support future functionality, not a security fix. 3. **No security-relevant patterns**: The code changes show: - Adding `kmemdup_array()` to create copies of ctx_arg_info - Adding cleanup code (`kfree(prog->aux->ctx_arg_info)`) - Changing pointer types from `const` to non-const - Modifying function return types for better error handling 4. **Similar to commit 1**: Like the first similar commit which refactored bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data (CVE Status: NO), this is also a refactoring change to improve code structure and prepare for future features. The commit is purely a preparatory change to enable program-specific information storage in ctx_arg_info for future BPF struct_ops improvements, with no security implications.
d838605fea6ea gfs2: Check for empty queue in run_queue
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes shown in the commit diff. Looking at the changes in the `run_queue` function: **Before the change:** - The function declared `struct gfs2_holder *gh = NULL;` - In the else branch, it would find the first waiter with `gh = find_first_waiter(gl);` - Then immediately use `gl->gl_target = gh->gh_state;` without checking if gh is NULL - Finally call `do_xmote(gl, gh, gl->gl_target);` **After the change:** - The function declares `struct gfs2_holder *gh;` without initialization - In the else branch, it finds the first waiter with `gh = find_first_waiter(gl);` - **Now adds a NULL check**: `if (!gh) goto out_unlock;` - Only proceeds to use gh if it's not NULL This is clearly a bug fix that prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference. If `find_first_waiter(gl)` returns NULL (indicating an empty queue), the old code would attempt to access `gh->gh_state` on a NULL pointer, which would cause a kernel crash. **Security Impact Analysis:** - This is a NULL pointer dereference bug in the kernel - It could lead to a kernel panic/crash (denial of service) - The bug is in the GFS2 filesystem locking mechanism - An attacker with local access who can trigger specific GFS2 operations might be able to cause a system crash - This represents a reliability and availability issue **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug that could cause a kernel crash, this appears to be a reliability/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. The bug would require specific timing conditions in the GFS2 filesystem's glock queue handling, and there's no clear attack vector that would allow an unprivileged user to reliably trigger this condition. The crash would be a simple NULL pointer dereference leading to a kernel panic, not memory corruption or privilege escalation. This is more of a quality/reliability issue than a security vulnerability warranting a CVE.
5595c31c37095 x86/Kconfig: make CFI_AUTO_DEFAULT depend on !RUST or Rust >= 1.88
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code: **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit addresses a situation where legitimate Rust code triggers a kernel panic due to incompatibility between Rust's CFI annotations and the kernel's FineIBT implementation. Key reasons: 1. **No vulnerability is being fixed** - The issue is that Rust's `core::fmt::rt::Argument::fmt()` function has CFI disabled (`#[no_sanitize(cfi, kcfi)]`), which causes a Control Protection fault when FineIBT is enabled. This is a false positive, not an actual security issue. 2. **The crash is a security feature working correctly** - FineIBT is doing exactly what it's supposed to do: detecting and blocking a CFI violation. The problem is that Rust's standard library legitimately needs to bypass CFI for this specific function due to its implementation details. 3. **The change reduces security, not increases it** - The fix actually weakens security by disabling FineIBT when Rust < 1.88 is used, falling back to the less secure kCFI-only mode. This is a trade-off for compatibility. 4. **Temporary compatibility issue** - This will be resolved in Rust 1.88 (scheduled for 2025-06-26), making it a transient compatibility problem rather than a fundamental security issue. The crash stack trace and BUG at `arch/x86/kernel/cet.c:132` shows the kernel's Control-flow Enforcement Technology correctly detecting what it perceives as a CFI violation, but in this case it's a false positive due to Rust's legitimate use of CFI-bypassing annotations.
bf3624cf1c370 netdevsim: call napi_schedule from a timer context
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination: **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. Brief explanation referencing specific parts of the code changes: 1. **Test/Development Driver Only**: The netdevsim driver is explicitly described as "Simulated networking device for testing" in its MODULE_DESCRIPTION and the Kconfig states "This driver is a developer testing tool and software model that can be used to test various control path networking APIs". 2. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a NOHZ tick-stop warning ("NOHZ tick-stop error: local softirq work is pending") which is a kernel debugging/warning message, not a security vulnerability. It indicates improper softirq handling but doesn't represent a security issue. 3. **No Security Impact**: The code change simply moves napi_schedule() calls from direct invocation in nsim_start_xmit() to being called from an hrtimer context (nsim_napi_schedule()). This addresses a context issue where softirqs weren't being properly handled, but there's no: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information leak - Denial of service (beyond the warning message) - Access control bypass 4. **Similar Pattern to Non-CVE Commits**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 1 (77e45145e303) which also addressed NOHZ tick-stop errors by adjusting how napi_schedule() is called, and that commit was marked as "CVE Status: NO". The change is a proper fix for a kernel warning in a test driver, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
9ce71e85b29eb phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2: Assert PLL reset on PHY power off
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my decision: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Impact**: The commit purely addresses a power consumption optimization issue. The code change adds PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) reset assertion during PHY power-off to save power. There is no security vulnerability being fixed. 2. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the specific changes: - The commit adds `val |= USB2_USBCTR_PLL_RST` when powering off the PHY - This mirrors what's already done during power-on (assert then deassert PLL reset) - The change only affects power consumption, not functionality or security 3. **Commit Message**: The commit message explicitly states "This saves power" - indicating this is a power optimization, not a security fix. 4. **No Attack Vector**: The missing PLL reset during power-off doesn't create any exploitable condition. It simply means the PLL continues running when it could be turned off, wasting power. 5. **Similar Patterns**: Looking at similar commits in the examples: - Commit 4 (stm32 refcount leak) received a CVE because it fixed a resource leak that could lead to denial of service - Commits 1-3 and 5 (various PHY power/initialization fixes) did NOT receive CVEs because they addressed power management or initialization sequences without security implications This is a typical power management optimization that improves the driver's efficiency but does not address any security vulnerability.
3e14c7207a975 clk: s2mps11: initialise clk_hw_onecell_data::num before accessing ::hws[] in probe()
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. Let me summarize the key points: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a bounds checking warning from UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer), not an exploitable security vulnerability. The issue only manifests when CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS is enabled, which is a debugging/hardening feature. 2. **Order of operations issue only**: The fix simply moves the initialization of `clk_data->num = S2MPS11_CLKS_NUM` to occur before the array access at `clk_data->hws[i]`. The array is properly allocated with the correct size via `struct_size(clk_data, hws, S2MPS11_CLKS_NUM)`, so there's no actual buffer overflow or memory corruption. 3. **No security impact**: The code correctly: - Allocates the structure with the right size using `struct_size()` - Loops within bounds (`i < S2MPS11_CLKS_NUM`) - S2MPS11_CLKS_NUM is a compile-time constant (3) 4. **Pattern matches similar non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 5 (clk: en7523) with the exact same pattern was marked as "CVE Status: NO", while the others were marked "YES". The key difference is that commits 1-4 deal with dynamic discovery of clocks where the array size could potentially be unbounded, while this commit (like commit 5) deals with a fixed, compile-time constant number of clocks. 5. **Development/debugging issue**: This is a correctness issue to satisfy the `__counted_by` annotation requirements for proper bounds checking during development, not a runtime security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. The change is a good practice fix to ensure the bounds sanitizer works correctly, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
f95d186255b31 btrfs: avoid NULL pointer dereference if no valid csum tree
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE. While initially it appeared this might require privileged access, my deeper analysis reveals this is a security vulnerability for the following reasons: 1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Leading to DoS**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that occurs when the btrfs filesystem is mounted with `rescue=idatacsums` and a scrub operation is performed. The crash happens because `csum_root` is NULL but the code still tries to use it. 2. **Attack Vector**: Although the scrub ioctl requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN, the critical factor is that once a filesystem is mounted with `rescue=idatacsums` by an administrator (perhaps to recover data), any subsequent scrub operation will crash the system. This creates a denial of service condition. 3. **Similar Pattern Recognition**: Looking at the similar commits provided, I see several CVEs were assigned for NULL pointer dereferences in btrfs, particularly: - The first two similar commits about "avoid NULL pointer dereference if no valid extent tree" were assigned CVEs - These had very similar patterns - NULL checks were missing for critical data structures 4. **Security Impact**: The vulnerability allows a local attacker with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to crash the system when specific mount options are in use. While this requires elevated privileges, it's still a security issue because: - It can be used to disrupt system availability - The mount option might be set for legitimate recovery purposes, and then the vulnerability becomes exploitable - System administrators with limited privileges (CAP_SYS_ADMIN but not full root) could exploit this 5. **Code Pattern**: The fix adds a check for `!csum_root` alongside the existing `!extent_root` check, preventing the NULL pointer dereference that would occur later when `btrfs_lookup_csums_bitmap()` is called with a NULL `csum_root`. This matches the pattern of other btrfs NULL pointer dereference fixes that received CVEs, making it appropriate for CVE assignment.
0f05886a40fdc fpga: altera-cvp: Increase credit timeout
- [sasha] Now I have enough information to make a determination. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit simply increases a timeout value from 20ms to 40ms for SDM (Secure Device Manager) credit responses during FPGA configuration. It's a reliability/robustness improvement, not a security fix. 2. **No Security Impact**: The timeout affects how long the driver waits for the SDM to respond with transmission credits. When the timeout occurs: - The function returns `-ETIMEDOUT` - The error is propagated up to the caller - The FPGA configuration fails gracefully with an error message - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues occur 3. **Performance/Reliability Issue**: The commit message clearly states this is to fix failures in "internal stress tests running at 500 loops" - this is a reliability issue under stress conditions, not a security vulnerability. 4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This change is similar to the other timeout increases shown in the examples that were marked as "CVE Status: NO": - "mei: vsc: Prevent timeout error with added delay" (increased timeouts, NO CVE) - "spi: zynqmp-gqspi: Scale timeout by data size" (timeout scaling, NO CVE) - "ASoC: rt722-sdca: increase clk_stop_timeout" (timeout increase, NO CVE) 5. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit the previous 20ms timeout to cause harm. The timeout simply ensures reliable communication with hardware during FPGA programming operations. The commit pattern matches other reliability improvements that increase timeouts to handle edge cases or stress conditions, none of which warrant CVE assignment.
5bb12b1837c0b ext4: Add support for EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_QUERY_LEAF_BLOCKS
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is a feature enhancement that adds support for a new flag `EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_QUERY_LEAF_BLOCKS` to handle a specific case in atomic write operations where contiguous extents can be split across adjacent leaf nodes in the extent tree. Key reasons why this is not a security fix: 1. **Feature addition, not a bug fix**: The commit explicitly states it "adds support" for a new feature to handle atomic writes properly when extents span leaf boundaries. 2. **No security vulnerability being addressed**: The problem described is a functional limitation where atomic writes might be split into multiple operations if contiguous extents happen to be stored across adjacent leaf nodes. This is a correctness/performance issue for atomic writes, not a security vulnerability. 3. **Defensive programming, not vulnerability patching**: The WARN_ON_ONCE checks and validation in the code are standard defensive programming practices for a new feature, not fixes for exploitable conditions. 4. **No memory corruption or privilege escalation risk**: The code adds logic to query adjacent leaf nodes to coalesce extents - there's no evidence of fixing buffer overflows, use-after-free, information disclosure, or other security issues. 5. **Part of a larger feature set**: This is clearly part of the atomic write support feature being added to ext4 (as evidenced by related commits), not a security fix. The commit is similar to the other "NO" examples which add functionality or improve correctness without addressing security vulnerabilities.
a7d755ed9ce97 io_uring: fix overflow resched cqe reordering
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer. **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Security Impact - CQE Reordering**: The commit fixes a bug where Completion Queue Entries (CQEs) can be reordered, which is a security-relevant issue. CQE ordering is critical for io_uring's correctness guarantees, particularly for: - Linked operations (where one operation depends on another) - F_MORE flag users (multi-shot operations) - General ordering guarantees that applications rely on 2. **Root Cause**: When the overflow flush function releases locks to reschedule (via `io_cq_unlock_post()` and `mutex_unlock()`), the CQE cache pointers (`ctx->cqe_cached` and `ctx->cqe_sentinel`) are reset by `io_cqe_cache_refill()`. Any new CQE emitters that run while the locks are released won't be forced into `io_cqe_cache_refill()` and can insert CQEs out of order. 3. **The Fix**: The patch adds `ctx->cqe_sentinel = ctx->cqe_cached;` before releasing the locks, which ensures that any new CQE emitters will be forced to go through `io_cqe_cache_refill()` and maintain proper ordering. 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: - The first two similar commits with "CVE Status: YES" were assigned CVEs for the original issue of not checking for reschedule during overflow flush (DoS vulnerability) - This new commit fixes a **different security issue** introduced by that fix - the reordering of completion events 5. **Exploitability**: While this requires triggering the overflow flush path with a large number of entries (as noted in the comments, "silly syzbot cases"), the consequence of CQE reordering can lead to: - Application logic errors - Race conditions - Potential privilege escalation if applications make security decisions based on CQE ordering - Data corruption if operations are processed out of order The security impact of breaking ordering guarantees in an asynchronous I/O subsystem is significant enough to warrant a CVE assignment.
2c0391b29b27f riscv: Allow NOMMU kernels to access all of RAM
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this commit fixes a security vulnerability or is just a feature enhancement. **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a feature enhancement that removes a limitation in NOMMU kernels where they couldn't access memory below the kernel link address. The commit changes `PAGE_OFFSET` for NOMMU configurations to be dynamically set to `phys_ram_base` instead of using a fixed `CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET`. 2. **No memory corruption fix**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (especially commit aea702dde7e9), this commit doesn't fix any memory corruption issues. The previous CVE-worthy commits fixed: - Memory corruption where "mm initialization runs off the beginning of mem_map and corrupts adjacent kernel memory" - Out-of-bounds access to vmemmap structures - Issues with PFN calculations causing kernel memory corruption 3. **Functional limitation removal**: The commit message states it "Remove[s] this restriction" - it's removing a functional limitation, not fixing a security bug. The previous behavior simply prevented access to certain memory regions in NOMMU configurations, which is a limitation but not a vulnerability. 4. **No fixes tag**: The commit doesn't have a "Fixes:" tag, suggesting it's not addressing a bug but rather implementing a new capability. 5. **Part of a feature series**: Looking at the context, this appears to be part of a series implementing relocatable NOMMU kernels, which is a feature enhancement rather than a security fix. The key difference from the CVE-worthy similar commits is that those fixed actual memory corruption bugs that could lead to system crashes or potential exploitation, while this commit simply enables access to previously inaccessible memory regions in NOMMU configurations.
eeb0819318cc0 fs/ntfs3: remove ability to change compression on mounted volume
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this specific commit warrants a CVE: **NO** This commit removes functionality rather than fixing a security vulnerability. While the previous commit (b432163ebd15) that it references did fix a security issue with changing compression states, this commit is purely a code removal/cleanup that eliminates the problematic feature entirely. Key reasons: 1. **No vulnerability is being fixed** - The commit removes the ability to change compression on mounted volumes, which is a feature removal, not a security fix 2. **Preventive measure** - This is a proactive removal of code deemed "not safe and not maintainable" 3. **No exploitable condition** - After this change, users simply cannot change compression states, so there's no vulnerability to exploit 4. **Similar to removing experimental features** - This is analogous to removing an experimental or problematic feature before it causes issues The previous commit (b432163ebd15) that added proper locking and a_ops updates would be a better candidate for a CVE as it fixed an actual race condition/corruption issue. This commit just removes the entire feature to prevent future issues.
30d68cb0c37eb ima: process_measurement() needlessly takes inode_lock() on MAY_READ
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it's a performance optimization that addresses an unnecessary lock acquisition problem. Here's why: 1. **Performance Optimization, Not Security Fix**: The commit message clearly states this is addressing a "performance problem for extremely heavy read-only workloads" where the inode_lock() was being taken unnecessarily. 2. **No Security Impact**: The change only affects when `violation_check` is set to true. It adds additional conditions to avoid taking the lock when: - There's no IMA_MEASURE action to be taken, AND - The file is not open for write 3. **Lock Still Taken When Needed**: The inode_lock() is still taken in all cases where actual IMA actions need to be performed or where there's a potential ToMToU (Time-of-Measure, Time-of-Use) violation to check. 4. **No Vulnerability Being Fixed**: The original code was overly conservative (taking the lock even when unnecessary for read-only operations), but this didn't create a security vulnerability - it just caused performance degradation. 5. **Similar to Other Non-CVE IMA Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, other IMA performance optimizations and flag handling improvements (commits 1-4) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", while only the use-after-free fix (commit 5) received a CVE. The change is a legitimate optimization that reduces lock contention without compromising the security guarantees of the IMA subsystem.
fba4d19f37314 drm/amd/display: Add opp recout adjustment
- [sasha] **NO** While this commit introduces a function (`spl_opp_adjust_rect`) with insufficient bounds checking that could theoretically lead to integer overflows, this does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Internal Display Pipeline Function**: This code operates within AMD's display driver's internal scaling and plane processing pipeline (SPL - Scaler and Plane Processing Library). The adjustment values come from internal driver calculations, not from untrusted user input. 2. **Limited Attack Surface**: The `opp_recout_adjust` values are set internally by the driver based on display configuration and YUV format requirements. There's no direct path for an attacker to control these values. 3. **Display Subsystem Context**: This is a display formatting/scaling adjustment for subsampled YUV formats. Even if overflow occurred, it would likely result in display corruption rather than exploitable memory corruption. 4. **Comparison with Similar Non-CVE Commits**: The similar commits shown (handling ODM scaling, viewport calculations, video caps limits) were not assigned CVEs despite dealing with similar display geometry calculations. 5. **No Security Boundary Crossing**: This doesn't involve privilege escalation, information disclosure across security boundaries, or remote code execution vectors. While the code could benefit from better bounds checking and overflow protection as a matter of good engineering practice, the lack of an exploitable attack vector from untrusted sources means this is a code quality issue rather than a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
5c03f9f4d3629 watchdog: aspeed: Update bootstatus handling
- [sasha] Now I understand the changes better. Let me analyze the security implications: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It updates the bootstatus handling logic for the ASPEED watchdog driver to provide more accurate and platform-specific reporting of reset causes. The changes include: 1. **Improved boot status reporting**: The commit moves from a simple check of `WDT_TIMEOUT_STATUS_BOOT_SECONDARY` to a more comprehensive approach that reads the actual reset status from SCU (System Control Unit) registers. 2. **Platform-specific handling**: Different ASPEED platforms (AST2400, AST2500, AST2600) have different ways of recording watchdog reset events, and this commit properly handles these differences. 3. **Status clearing**: The code adds logic to clear the watchdog reset event flags after reading them, ensuring accurate status for future boots. The key observation is that this is purely a diagnostic/reporting enhancement. The bootstatus field is used to inform userspace (via `/sys/class/watchdog/watchdogX/bootstatus`) about why the system was last reset. This information is read-only from userspace and doesn't affect system security or stability. There's no evidence of: - Memory corruption fixes - Access control bypasses - Privilege escalation fixes - Input validation improvements - Race condition fixes - Information disclosure fixes The code changes are limited to improving the accuracy of boot status reporting, which is a functional enhancement rather than a security fix.
8c9da7cd0bbcc drm/mediatek: mtk_dpi: Add checks for reg_h_fre_con existence
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue! The new `mt8195_conf` configuration has `support_direct_pin = true` but does **NOT** set `reg_h_fre_con`. This means `reg_h_fre_con` will be 0 (default initialized). Without the checks added in this commit, when `mtk_dpi_config_2n_h_fre()` or `mtk_dpi_config_disable_edge()` are called for the MT8195 DPI configuration, they would try to access register at offset 0, which could lead to: 1. **Invalid memory access**: Writing to `dpi->regs + 0` would write to the base address of the memory-mapped register region, which might be an invalid/reserved register 2. **Unpredictable behavior**: Writing to unintended registers could cause hardware malfunction 3. **System crash**: In worst case, accessing invalid memory regions could cause kernel panic This is a **NULL pointer dereference** vulnerability in the sense that it's dereferencing offset 0, which is similar to a NULL pointer issue. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This is a preparatory/defensive programming change that adds NULL checks to prevent potential issues with future hardware support. The commit message explicitly states "In preparation for adding support for newer DPI instances". 2. **No existing vulnerable configuration**: At the time of this commit, there is no existing configuration in the kernel that has `support_direct_pin = true` without setting `reg_h_fre_con`. The MT8195 DPI configuration that would trigger this issue is added in a later commit (48bfb13cc8cb). 3. **Preventive measure**: This is proactive code hardening to support future hardware, not a fix for an existing security issue. The code without these checks was working correctly for all existing hardware configurations. 4. **No exploitable attack vector**: Even if the issue existed, it would only affect specific MediaTek hardware configurations during display initialization, not create an exploitable security vulnerability that could be triggered by an attacker. The commit is good defensive programming practice to prevent potential issues with new hardware support, but it does not fix an existing security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
50f37fc2a39c4 ipv4: ip_gre: Fix set but not used warning in ipgre_err() if IPv4-only
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a code cleanup to fix a compiler warning. The commit message explicitly states it's fixing a "set but not used warning" that occurs when CONFIG_IPV6 is disabled. 2. **No functional change**: The code changes simply move the `data_len` variable declaration and initialization inside the `#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)` block where it's actually used. This is a scope reduction that has no impact on program behavior. 3. **No security implications**: - The variable was already being set correctly when needed (for ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED messages) - It was already being passed correctly to `ip6_err_gen_icmpv6_unreach()` when IPv6 is enabled - When IPv6 is disabled, the entire code block that uses `data_len` is compiled out, so the unused variable had no effect 4. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), which all received "CVE Status: NO". Those commits also fixed compiler warnings by adjusting variable scope or using IS_ENABLED() macros without changing functionality. 5. **Build-time issue only**: The issue only manifests as a compiler warning when building with specific configuration options (CONFIG_NET_IPGRE=y and CONFIG_IPV6=n) and has no runtime impact. This is a typical code maintenance commit that improves code quality by eliminating compiler warnings but does not fix any security vulnerability.
2b15a0693f70d net: pktgen: fix mpls maximum labels list parsing
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a simple off-by-one error in bounds checking that prevented users from using all 16 MPLS labels. The bug made the parser reject valid input at exactly MAX_MPLS_LABELS (16) entries when it should have allowed them. 2. **No memory corruption or overflow**: The fix moves the bounds check from after incrementing `n` to before, ensuring proper validation. The original code still prevented buffer overflow - it just did so one element too early. The array `labels[MAX_MPLS_LABELS]` has 16 elements (indices 0-15), and the original code would reject at n=16, preventing any out-of-bounds access. 3. **Functional limitation only**: The commit message shows this was just a usability issue - users couldn't specify the full 16 MPLS labels they should have been able to use. The error message "Argument list too long" (-E2BIG) was returned prematurely. 4. **pktgen is a testing tool**: The pktgen module is a packet generator tool used for network testing and benchmarking, typically used by developers and system administrators in controlled environments, not a core security component. 5. **Safe error handling**: The code properly returns -E2BIG when the limit is exceeded, preventing any unsafe behavior. The code change simply ensures users can utilize all 16 MPLS label slots as intended, rather than being limited to 15. This is a functional fix, not a security fix.
4a57346652154 wifi: rtw89: coex: Separated Wi-Fi connecting event from Wi-Fi scan event
- [sasha] Looking at this WiFi driver commit, I need to analyze the commit message and code changes: **Commit Message Analysis:** - Title: "wifi: rtw89: coex: Separated Wi-Fi connecting event from Wi-Fi scan event" - The commit describes separating Wi-Fi connecting events from Wi-Fi scan events for coexistence handling - It mentions that Wi-Fi connecting processes don't need firmware slot control assignment - It fixes an issue where firmware wouldn't toggle slots because the driver wasn't providing slot schedule information - It ensures the 4-way handshake status is canceled when the connecting event ends **Code Changes Analysis:** 1. In `_action_wl_scan()`: - Added a condition to check `btc->cx.state_map != BTC_WLINKING` before executing scan offload logic - This prevents incorrect handling when in a connecting state 2. In `rtw89_btc_ntfy_scan_finish()`: - Added `btc->dm.tdma_instant_excute = 1;` to enable immediate TDMA execution 3. In `rtw89_btc_ntfy_role_info()`: - Extended the condition for clearing the 4-way handshake status to include `BTC_ROLE_MSTS_STA_CONN_END` in addition to `BTC_ROLE_MSTS_STA_DIS_CONN` **Security Impact Assessment:** This appears to be a functional fix for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence management, not a security vulnerability fix. The changes: - Improve state management between Wi-Fi scanning and connecting events - Fix slot scheduling issues that could cause connectivity problems - Ensure proper cleanup of handshake state There are no indications of: - Memory corruption fixes - Buffer overflow fixes - Access control issues - Race condition fixes - Privilege escalation fixes - Input validation improvements The commit addresses a functional issue where the firmware wouldn't properly toggle slots during Wi-Fi connection attempts, which could lead to connectivity issues but not security vulnerabilities. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a functional fix for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth coexistence handling that improves connectivity behavior but does not address any security vulnerabilities. The changes are limited to state management and timing adjustments for coexistence features, with no security-sensitive modifications.
16705e52e6291 ext4: make regular file's buffered write path support large folios
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Feature Enhancement, Not a Bug Fix**: The commit is adding support for large folios (multi-page memory units) to ext4's buffered write path. The commit message clearly states "To support larger folios, modify..." - this is a new feature implementation, not fixing a security vulnerability. 2. **Safe Code Changes**: The changes are converting hardcoded PAGE_SIZE calculations to use proper folio-aware helpers: - `pos & (PAGE_SIZE - 1)` → `offset_in_folio(folio, pos)` - `BUG_ON(to > PAGE_SIZE)` → `BUG_ON(to > folio_size(folio))` - Added length validation: `if (pos + len > folio_pos(folio) + folio_size(folio))` 3. **Proper Bounds Checking**: The commit actually adds additional safety checks. The new code properly validates that write operations don't exceed the folio boundaries with the added check: ```c if (pos + len > folio_pos(folio) + folio_size(folio)) len = folio_pos(folio) + folio_size(folio) - pos; ``` 4. **Part of a Feature Series**: Looking at surrounding commits (fdbd0df9d4a3 "ext4: make ext4_mpage_readpages() support large folios"), this is part of a coordinated effort to add large folio support to ext4, not fixing any existing vulnerability. 5. **No Security Impact**: The changes don't fix any memory corruption, information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other security issues. They're purely adapting existing code to work with variable-sized folios instead of fixed PAGE_SIZE units. This is similar to the historical commits shown that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - they were code improvements and feature additions rather than security fixes.
ed3b274abc400 ASoC: codecs: wsa883x: Correct VI sense channel mask
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, let me now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The change corrects a channel mask configuration from `0x3` (2 channels) to `0x1` (1 channel) for the VI sense port. This is a configuration error, not a security vulnerability. 2. **VI sense functionality**: VI sense (Voltage/Current sensing) is used for speaker protection and monitoring. It's a feedback mechanism that reads voltage and current data from the speaker to prevent damage and optimize performance. 3. **Impact analysis**: - The commit message states this fixes "garbage being recorded by the speaker when testing the VI sense feedback path" - This is a functional bug that causes incorrect data in the audio feedback path - The issue only affects audio quality/functionality during VI sense testing, not system security 4. **No security implications**: - No memory corruption or buffer overflows - No privilege escalation possibilities - No access control bypass - No information disclosure of sensitive data (just incorrect audio feedback data) - The "garbage" data is simply incorrect audio samples, not memory contents from other processes 5. **Supporting evidence from code**: - The `wsa_sink_dpn_prop` configuration already correctly specifies `min_ch = 1, max_ch = 1` for the VISENSE port - This is purely a configuration mismatch in the port config structure - Similar to the reference commits shown (which also have "CVE Status: NO"), this is a simple mask correction This is a typical audio driver bug fix that improves functionality but has no security implications.
5ccf1b8ae76dd xen/pci: Do not register devices with segments >= 0x10000
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a vulnerability fix**: This commit adds defensive bounds checking to prevent potential issues, but it's not fixing an existing security vulnerability. It's a proactive measure to handle a limitation in the Xen hypercall interface. 2. **Interface limitation handling**: The commit addresses an architectural limitation where Xen's hypercall interface only supports 16-bit PCI segment values, while Linux can have segments >= 0x10000 (particularly with VMD devices). This is not a security bug but rather a compatibility issue. 3. **No exploitable condition**: The code changes show that before this patch, attempts to register devices with high segment numbers would likely fail or cause errors. The commit message states "would result in errors at best, or overlaps with existing devices living on the truncated equivalent segment values." While overlap could theoretically be problematic, there's no indication this was exploitable for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service. 4. **Graceful handling**: The changes simply add checks to skip registration/unregistration/reset operations for devices with segment numbers that exceed the Xen interface limits, returning success (0) and logging an informational message. This prevents errors but doesn't fix a security vulnerability. 5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they show PCI-related changes for compatibility, hardware support, and configuration - none of which were assigned CVEs. This commit follows the same pattern of improving compatibility and robustness rather than fixing a security issue. The commit improves the robustness of the Xen PCI handling code but does not address an actual security vulnerability.
9f00e2218e15a wifi: rtw88: Fix rtw_update_sta_info() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes rate mask calculations for the RTL8814AU wireless adapter's firmware communication. This is a functional fix that ensures the driver correctly communicates supported data rates (specifically 3SS and 4SS HT rates) to the firmware. 2. **No security impact**: The changes involve: - Adding proper handling of rx_mask[2] and rx_mask[3] for 3/4 spatial stream HT rates - Filtering rate masks based on hardware capabilities (nss = 1, 2, or 3) - Updating tx_num calculation to use actual hardware spatial stream count 3. **Bug type**: This is a logic error where the driver was not properly handling all spatial stream configurations for RTL8814AU (which supports up to 3 spatial streams). The fix ensures proper rate negotiation but doesn't address any security boundary violations, memory safety issues, or exploitable conditions. 4. **Impact is functional only**: The bug would result in suboptimal rate selection or incorrect firmware configuration, potentially affecting performance but not security. The similar commits analyzed also show a pattern of functional fixes and enhancements to the rtw88 driver (rate calculations, power management, etc.) that were not assigned CVEs, reinforcing that this type of change is not security-relevant.
cb0de06d1b0af drm/amdgpu: remove all KFD fences from the BO on release
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to evaluate: 1. **Nature of the change**: This commit modifies how eviction fences are removed when a buffer object (BO) is released 2. **Key changes**: - Changes from `amdgpu_amdkfd_remove_fence_on_pt_pd_bos()` to `amdgpu_amdkfd_remove_all_eviction_fences()` - Modifies locking behavior - now locks the private `_resv` object instead of the shared `resv` - Changes how fences are handled during BO release - Adds proper locking with `dma_resv_trylock()` at the beginning of release notification 3. **Security implications**: - The old code had a complex path through parent BOs that could potentially lead to race conditions - The new code ensures proper locking of the private reservation object during release - This prevents potential race conditions where eviction fences could be accessed while the BO is being released - The commit message mentions preventing "unnecessary eviction" but the code changes show proper synchronization improvements 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: - The commit with CVE status YES (drm/amdgpu/mes: fix use-after-free issue) explicitly fixed a UAF vulnerability - Recent commits in the same area (13d0724f0ffe, af7160c25c68) fixed use-after-unlock and fence dereference issues - This commit appears to fix a potential race condition in fence handling during BO release **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. While it does improve synchronization and fix a potential race condition in the eviction fence handling during buffer object release, it appears to be a correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. The changes ensure proper locking and prevent unnecessary evictions, but there's no clear indication of exploitable security impact such as memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. The commit is more about optimization and correctness in the fence management system rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
00a134fc2bb4a MIPS: pm-cps: Use per-CPU variables as per-CPU, not per-core
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination: **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The issue causes incorrect sharing of power management synchronization variables between CPUs in multi-cluster MIPS systems. 2. **Impact is Power Management Functionality**: The affected code is in the power management subsystem (pm-cps.c) and deals with synchronization when CPUs enter/exit low-power states. When CPUs from different clusters incorrectly share these variables: - `nc_asm_enter`: Entry functions for non-coherent states - `ready_count`: Counting VPEs ready for non-coherent operation - `pm_barrier`: Synchronization barrier for deep idle states 3. **No Security Consequences**: The incorrect sharing would cause synchronization issues between unrelated CPUs during power state transitions, potentially leading to: - Incorrect power state coordination - CPUs not properly entering/exiting idle states - Possible system instability during power management operations However, there's no evidence this creates exploitable conditions like: - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Memory corruption - Denial of service beyond normal system instability 4. **Limited Scope**: The issue only affects multi-cluster MIPS systems, which have a limited deployment base, and only manifests during power management operations. 5. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: Looking at the reference commits, this is similar to commit 2 (drivers: perf: Fix smp_processor_id() use in preemptible code) and commit 5 (cpu: Fix broken cmdline "nosmp" and "maxcpus=0") which were functional fixes without security implications and did not receive CVEs. The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves system stability on multi-cluster MIPS platforms, but it does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
8260731ccad04 drm/gem: Internally test import_attach for imported objects
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Logic fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes an incorrect test condition in `drm_gem_is_imported()`. The original implementation tested `obj->dma_buf && (obj->dma_buf->priv != obj)`, but during cleanup, `dma_buf` can be NULL, causing the function to incorrectly return false for imported objects. 2. **No security impact**: The issue causes incorrect cleanup path selection (treating imported objects as native objects during cleanup), but this doesn't lead to: - Memory corruption - Use-after-free vulnerabilities - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Denial of service 3. **Cleanup path correctness**: Looking at the code paths affected (e.g., in `drm_gem_shmem_free()`), when an imported object is incorrectly treated as native: - It attempts to clean up resources that don't exist for imported objects - The code has proper NULL checks and error handling - No memory safety issues arise from this incorrect classification 4. **Similar to non-CVE examples**: This issue is similar to the first example commit (omap_gem locking fix) which was marked as NO CVE - both fix logic errors in resource management without security implications. The commit is a correctness fix that ensures imported GEM objects are properly identified during cleanup, preventing potential resource leaks or incorrect cleanup operations, but it does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities.
9cd3f4efc8704 drm/xe/sa: Always call drm_suballoc_manager_fini()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Resource leak, not exploitable vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a missing cleanup call (`drm_suballoc_manager_fini()`) in an error path when `kvzalloc()` fails. This leads to a resource leak of already initialized lists and wait queues in the `drm_suballoc_manager` structure, but not to any exploitable security vulnerability. 2. **Limited impact**: The code shows that if `kvzalloc()` fails after `drm_suballoc_manager_init()` has been called, the function returns an error without calling the corresponding `fini()` function. However: - The memory allocated by `drmm_kzalloc()` for the manager itself is properly cleaned up via the DRM managed resource system - The only resources leaked are some initialized list heads and a wait queue head (from lines 75-81 in `drm_suballoc_manager_init()`) - This is a minor memory leak that only occurs in an already-failing allocation path 3. **No security boundary crossing**: The commit doesn't fix any issues related to: - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Memory corruption - Access control bypass - Race conditions affecting security 4. **Defensive programming**: The fix is more about proper cleanup ordering and defensive programming practices rather than addressing a security vulnerability. Moving `drm_suballoc_manager_init()` after the `kvzalloc()` call ensures that if allocation fails, there's nothing to clean up. 5. **Pattern comparison**: Comparing with the provided similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES", those involved actual crashes (NULL pointer dereferences causing oops) that could potentially be exploited for denial of service. This commit only addresses a minor resource leak in an error path.
85aad7cc41787 rcu: Fix get_state_synchronize_rcu_full() GP-start detection
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a race condition in RCU's grace period detection that can cause `poll_state_synchronize_rcu_full()` to incorrectly report that a grace period has completed when it hasn't. This occurs in an extremely rare scenario involving CPU hotplug operations and specific timing windows. 2. **Limited impact and exploitation difficulty**: - The commit message explicitly states it took "many weeks to convince rcutorture to reproduce this more frequently than once per year" - Requires frequent CPU-hotplug operations (50ms intervals) - Requires specific kernel configurations (CONFIG_PROVE_RCU=y, TREE03.boot settings) - Requires "extremely heavy use of get_state_synchronize_rcu_full()" - As of v6.12, only kfree_rcu() uses these APIs, and "not particularly heavily" 3. **No security implications in production**: - The bug manifests primarily in rcutorture testing scenarios with artificial conditions - The kfree_rcu() usage has WARN_ON_ONCE() checks that would catch premature grace period detection - The theoretical use-after-free mentioned requires specific kernel boot parameters (rcutree.rcu_normal_wake_from_gp=1) and is described as "theoretical" - No demonstrated path to exploitation in normal production workloads 4. **Detection and mitigation**: - The issue is caught by CONFIG_PROVE_RCU debugging - Production systems have WARN_ON checks that would detect the condition - The race window is extraordinarily small and requires precise timing This is a correctness bug in RCU's internal implementation that affects testing/debugging scenarios but does not present a realistic security vulnerability in production systems. The extreme difficulty of reproduction and lack of security impact in real-world scenarios make this unsuitable for CVE assignment.
d8c782cac5007 drm/amd/display: Initial psr_version with correct setting
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Limited Scope**: The uninitialized `psr_version` only affects **virtual links** - these are software-only display connections used for testing or special configurations, not physical hardware displays. 2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The code change is in the virtual link creation path (`num_virtual_links`), which is typically only used in controlled environments. There's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or remote attack vector. 3. **Initialization vs. Vulnerability**: While the commit does fix an uninitialized variable, this appears to be a correctness/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. The PSR feature would simply not work correctly on virtual displays without this initialization. 4. **Different from Similar CVE Commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs (commits 4 & 5) involved: - Physical hardware (dual eDP panels) - System hangs affecting real users - Feature regression that broke existing functionality This commit only affects virtual display initialization during link creation. 5. **No User Impact**: Virtual links are not typically exposed to end users and are primarily used for development/testing purposes. The worst case would be incorrect PSR behavior on a virtual display, not a system crash or security breach. While this is a good defensive programming fix that prevents potential issues with uninitialized memory, it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it doesn't represent a real security vulnerability affecting production systems or user-facing functionality.
08fafac4c9f28 kunit: tool: Use qboot on QEMU x86_64
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my determination: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Testing Infrastructure Only**: The change is purely in the KUnit testing framework configuration (`tools/testing/kunit/qemu_configs/x86_64.py`), which is used for kernel unit testing. This is development/testing infrastructure, not production kernel code. 2. **No Security Impact**: The change simply switches from SeaBIOS to qboot as the BIOS for QEMU when running x86_64 KUnit tests. This is a configuration preference that: - Only affects terminal display formatting during testing - Is described as making the terminal output cleaner and slightly faster - Has no impact on the actual kernel being tested or any production systems 3. **Developer Tool Enhancement**: The commit message explicitly states this is to improve the developer experience when using `--raw_output=all` flag with kunit.py. It's a quality-of-life improvement for developers running kernel unit tests. 4. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: There is no security vulnerability being addressed. The "mess of the terminal" mentioned refers to formatting/display issues, not any security concern. The code change is minimal - just adding `extra_qemu_params=['-bios', 'qboot.rom']` to use qboot instead of the default SeaBIOS for QEMU emulation during testing. This is entirely within the testing framework and has no security implications.
46d22b47df274 nvmet-tcp: don't restore null sk_state_change
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Let me analyze the commit: **YES** This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the nvmet-tcp driver. The vulnerability occurs when: 1. `nvmet_tcp_set_queue_sock()` is called when the TCP socket is not in TCP_ESTABLISHED state 2. In this case, `queue->state_change` is never initialized (remains NULL) because the code only sets it when `sock->sk->sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED` 3. Later, when `nvmet_tcp_restore_socket_callbacks()` is called during queue teardown, it unconditionally tries to restore `sock->sk->sk_state_change = queue->state_change` 4. This assigns NULL to `sock->sk->sk_state_change` 5. When the TCP stack later calls the state_change callback (e.g., during tcp_fin()), it dereferences the NULL pointer, causing a kernel crash The fix adds a NULL check before attempting to restore the callbacks. This is a classic NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can crash the kernel, making it a denial-of-service security issue. The crash trace in the commit message shows this happening in a real scenario where the NULL function pointer is called from tcp_fin(). This matches the pattern of similar CVE-assigned commits that fix NULL pointer dereferences leading to kernel crashes.
d6ebcde6d4ecf padata: do not leak refcount in reorder_work
- [sasha] **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While this commit fixes a memory leak, it does not meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE: 1. **Limited Security Impact**: This is a reference count leak that only occurs when `queue_work()` returns false (work already queued). This is a rare condition that happens when the same work item is queued multiple times in quick succession. 2. **Not Easily Exploitable**: The leak requires very specific timing conditions - the reorder_work must already be queued when padata_reorder() tries to queue it again. This is difficult for an attacker to reliably trigger. 3. **Resource Leak vs Security Vulnerability**: While memory leaks can theoretically lead to DoS through resource exhaustion, this particular leak: - Leaks only one reference per occurrence - Requires specific race conditions - Is self-limiting (can't repeatedly queue the same work) - Affects internal kernel crypto operations, not directly controllable by unprivileged users 4. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs fixed actual Use-After-Free vulnerabilities which can lead to memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, or system crashes. This commit only fixes a reference leak with limited impact. The commit is properly marked with `Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>` indicating it should be backported for correctness, but it's a reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability.
c7f50d0433a01 wifi: iwlwifi: don't warn when if there is a FW error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Impact**: The change simply avoids generating a warning (WARN_ONCE) when `iwl_trans_reclaim` is called during a firmware error state. It adds an early return check for `STATUS_FW_ERROR` before the existing `WARN_ONCE` check, similar to how other functions like `iwl_trans_tx` handle this condition. 2. **Cosmetic/Diagnostic Change**: The commit only suppresses a warning message that would appear in logs when the firmware is in an error state. The function already had proper error handling (it would return early after the warning). This change just makes it return silently instead of warning. 3. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message states this is to "don't warn when if there is a FW error" and explains it's unnecessary to warn during a pending restart after a firmware error. There's no mention of fixing any security vulnerability, crash, memory corruption, or privilege escalation. 4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (CVE Status: NO) - Changes error handling and logging behavior - Similar Commit 2 (CVE Status: NO) - Removes fw_running check and changes internal operations - Similar Commit 3 (CVE Status: NO) - Changes log level from KERN_ERR to IWL_DEBUG_FW 5. **Pattern Consistency**: The change follows the same pattern already used in `iwl_trans_tx` function, which checks for `STATUS_FW_ERROR` before the `WARN_ONCE` check. This is just making the error handling consistent across similar functions. This is a quality-of-life improvement to reduce log noise during firmware error conditions, not a security fix.
a79be02bba5c3 Fix mis-uses of 'cc-option' for warning disablement
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Build system issue only**: The commit fixes incorrect usage of the `cc-option` macro for compiler warning options. This is purely a build system issue that affects compiler flag detection, not runtime behavior. 2. **No security impact**: The changes replace `$(call cc-option, -Wno-xyz)` with `$(call cc-disable-warning, xyz)`. This only affects which compiler warnings are enabled/disabled during the build process. It doesn't change any runtime code or introduce any security vulnerabilities. 3. **Warning suppression only**: The affected code paths are: - Disabling `-Wno-stringop-overflow` warnings - Disabling `-Wno-unterminated-string-initialization` warnings - Disabling `-Wno-override-init` warnings in various architecture-specific files - Disabling `-Wno-frame-address` warnings 4. **Build correctness fix**: The issue being fixed is that `cc-option` doesn't properly detect unsupported `-Wno-*` flags because GCC silently accepts them, only complaining later when another warning triggers. This could cause unexpected build warnings but has no impact on the compiled code's security or functionality. 5. **Similar to historical non-CVE commits**: The first similar commit shown (kbuild: make -Woverride-init warnings more consistent) was marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit has the same nature - it's a build system cleanup for compiler warning handling. The commit is a build infrastructure improvement that ensures the build system correctly detects and uses compiler warning flags. It has no security implications whatsoever.
6c778f1b839b6 ice: Fix LACP bonds without SRIOV environment
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a functional bug that causes LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) bonds to fail when specific conditions are met. The failure results in incorrect LACP Aggregator IDs being assigned, which prevents proper bonding functionality but does not create a security vulnerability. 2. **Operational failure, not exploitable**: The bug causes a failure in network bonding configuration where two interfaces get different Aggregator IDs. This is a configuration/operational issue that leads to the bond not working properly, but it cannot be exploited for: - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Denial of service (beyond the bond simply not working as configured) - Remote code execution 3. **The fix adds validation checks**: The changes add checks for `ice_is_switchdev_running()` to ensure the driver doesn't proceed with certain LAG operations when switchdev mode is not active. This is a defensive programming practice to handle an edge case configuration scenario. 4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects systems with: - Intel ice network driver - SRIOV LAG DDP package enabled - Specific bonding configuration (802.3ad LACP mode) - Simultaneous addition of interfaces to the bond While this is a legitimate bug fix that improves the driver's handling of edge cases in LAG configuration, it does not represent a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
f34621f31e3be arm64: tegra: p2597: Fix gpio for vdd-1v8-dis regulator
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Explanation: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a simple device tree fix that corrects a GPIO pin assignment from pin 14 to pin 9 for the vdd_1v8_dis regulator enable signal. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The change does not fix any security vulnerability. It's correcting a hardware description error where the wrong GPIO pin was specified for controlling a display power regulator. 3. **Limited impact**: - The regulator is marked as "regulator-always-on", meaning the kernel keeps it enabled regardless of the GPIO state - The regulator name "VDD_LCD_1V8_DIS" indicates it powers the LCD display at 1.8V - This only affects the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 Developer Kit (tegra210-p2371-2180) 4. **Type of issue**: This is a functional correctness issue, not a security issue. Having the wrong GPIO pin might mean: - The regulator control wouldn't work properly if software tried to disable it - But since it's marked "always-on", this functionality isn't used anyway 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Like the similar commits shown (fixing DMA IDs, GPIO numbers, device tree locations), this is a hardware description correction that ensures the device tree accurately reflects the actual board design, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit simply ensures the device tree matches the board schematics, which is important for correctness but does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
e8cd8224a3079 drm/msm/dpu: Set possible clones for all encoders
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a feature enhancement that adds support for encoder cloning in the MSM/DPU driver, not a security fix. The changes: 1. **Add new functionality** - The `dpu_encoder_get_clones()` function is entirely new code that enables writeback encoders to be clones of DSI encoders (and vice versa). 2. **Conditional feature activation** - The clone mask is only set when concurrent writeback (CWB) is available (`catalog->cwb_count > 0`), indicating this is enabling a new capability rather than fixing existing broken behavior. 3. **No security implications** - The `possible_clones` field in DRM is used for display configuration purposes (allowing multiple outputs to show the same content). Not setting it doesn't create any security vulnerabilities - it just limits functionality. 4. **Part of a feature series** - This is patch 14 in a concurrent writeback feature series, as evidenced by the link format (`20250214-concurrent-wb-v6-14`). The code changes are purely additive and don't fix any memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security-relevant bugs. This is typical display driver feature development.
0bf2d838de1ff taskstats: fix struct taskstats breaks backward compatibility since version 15
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is an ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a backward compatibility break in the `taskstats` structure where new fields were added in the middle of the structure rather than at the end. 2. **No security impact**: The issue only affects userspace programs that use the taskstats interface for performance monitoring and accounting. Programs compiled against different kernel versions would see data misalignment, but this doesn't create any security vulnerabilities like: - No privilege escalation - No information disclosure of sensitive data - No denial of service - No memory corruption 3. **Limited scope**: The taskstats interface is primarily used by system accounting and performance monitoring tools (like getdelays). The misaligned data would cause incorrect statistics to be reported but wouldn't compromise system security. 4. **Version management issue**: The problem was that version 15 broke the ABI by inserting fields in the middle of the structure. The fix (version 16) moves these fields to the end to restore compatibility. This is a software engineering/compatibility issue, not a security issue. 5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to commit 1 in the examples (CVE Status: NO) which was also a structural refactoring without security implications. The commit message clearly states this is about fixing "backward compatibility" rather than addressing any security concern. While it's an important fix for maintaining ABI stability, it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment.
3a5fa55455db6 drm/amd/display: Support multiple options during psr entry.
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a hardware compatibility fix that adds a configuration option (`power_down_phy_before_disable_stream`) to handle certain panels that cannot properly process idle patterns during PSR (Panel Self Refresh) entry. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It addresses a display compatibility issue where some panels have trouble with idle patterns, requiring a different power-down sequence. 3. **Code changes analysis**: - Adds a new uint8_t flag to `psr_settings` structure - Simply copies this setting from the link configuration to the DMUB (Display Microcontroller Unit) firmware - No buffer overflow fixes, access control changes, or security boundary violations addressed 4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), they all deal with PSR functionality improvements, timing adjustments, and display compatibility fixes - none received CVEs because they're feature enhancements or compatibility fixes rather than security fixes. 5. **Impact**: The issue being fixed is a display functionality problem (panels not handling idle patterns properly), not a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. This is a typical display driver compatibility enhancement that allows the driver to work correctly with a wider range of hardware, not a security fix.
db1cafc77aaaf cpufreq: amd-pstate: Remove unnecessary driver_lock in set_boost
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It removes an unnecessary lock (`amd_pstate_driver_lock`) from the `amd_pstate_set_boost()` function to prevent a potential deadlock condition. Key points: 1. The commit message clearly states this is removing an "unnecessary" lock that could lead to a deadlock 2. The deadlock is a functionality/reliability issue, not a security vulnerability 3. The lock being removed was protecting per-policy operations, but the commit message explains that since `set_boost` is already a per-policy function, a driver-wide lock is not needed 4. This is a code quality improvement that prevents a potential deadlock between `set_boost` and `status_store()` paths 5. The similar commits shown also deal with locking improvements and cleanup in the amd-pstate driver, none of which were assigned CVEs While deadlocks can sometimes be security issues if they can be triggered by unprivileged users to cause denial of service, this appears to be a driver internal locking issue that would require privileged access to trigger (changing CPU frequency policies requires root/CAP_SYS_ADMIN). The commit is fixing a design issue rather than an exploitable vulnerability.
1041c117a2c33 cifs: Fix and improve cifs_query_path_info() and cifs_query_file_info()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** This commit is primarily a functionality improvement and compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the changes**: The commit improves compatibility with older Win9x SMB servers by: - Avoiding unsupported commands (CIFSSMBQPathInfo/CIFSSMBQFileInfo) on non-NT servers - Using fallback methods (CIFSFindFirst or SMBQueryInformation) when needed - Handling the fact that Win9x returns "bogus data" in certain attribute fields 2. **The "bogus data" issue**: While Win9x servers return incorrect attribute data (e.g., incorrectly marking files as reparse points), this is handled as a compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. The code simply avoids using these problematic commands. 3. **The wildcard handling**: The code adds protection against wildcard expansion in non-UNICODE mode (line 573: `strpbrk(full_path, "*?\"><")`). This is a defensive measure to prevent incorrect behavior when fallback functions expand wildcards, but there's no indication this fixes an exploitable vulnerability - it just ensures correct path querying behavior. 4. **Error handling**: The changes improve error handling and add proper fallback mechanisms, which is good defensive programming but doesn't fix a security vulnerability. 5. **Similar commits analysis**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) show that routine CIFS/SMB protocol handling improvements, compatibility fixes, and attribute handling corrections are not typically assigned CVEs. This is a quality improvement that makes the CIFS client more robust when dealing with legacy servers, but it doesn't fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
dfc88357b6b63 usb: xhci: Don't change the status of stalled TDs on failed Stop EP
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I'll provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Impact**: The commit fixes a race condition where the error code of a Transfer Descriptor (TD) could be incorrectly changed from -EPIPE (broken pipe/stall) to -EPROTO (protocol error). Both error codes indicate failures, and the difference is primarily semantic - it affects error reporting to userspace but doesn't create a security vulnerability. 2. **Theoretical Issue**: The commit message explicitly states "I haven't seen this case yet" - this is a theoretical race condition that the developer identified through code inspection, not an actual observed security issue. 3. **Error Handling Improvement**: The change prevents double-handling of a stalled endpoint by checking if the stall has already been processed (via the EP_HALTED flag check). This is a correctness improvement in error handling logic. 4. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The code change doesn't introduce any paths for: - Memory corruption - Information disclosure - Privilege escalation - Denial of service - Access control bypass 5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: The similar commits provided show that xHCI driver fixes related to Stop Endpoint command handling, race conditions, and error status management are typically not assigned CVEs. They are treated as driver reliability improvements. The key change is adding this check: ```c if (ep->ep_state & EP_HALTED) goto reset_done; ``` This simply prevents redundant processing of an already-handled stall condition, improving the driver's robustness but not addressing any security vulnerability.
76047483fe944 drm/ttm: fix the warning for hit_low and evict_low
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The code changes are purely documentation fixes: 1. **Nature of changes**: The commit only adds kernel-doc comments (documentation) for two existing struct members (`hit_low` and `evict_low`) in `struct ttm_bo_swapout_walk`. The actual code logic remains unchanged. 2. **No functional impact**: The changes are limited to adding two comment lines: - `/** @hit_low: Whether we should attempt to swap BO's with low watermark threshold */` - `/** @evict_low: If we cannot swap a bo when @try_low is false (first pass) */` 3. **Warning fixes**: The commit message explicitly states it's fixing documentation warnings from the kernel's documentation build system, not any security vulnerability or functional bug. 4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, particularly commits 1-4 which all have "CVE Status: NO", they show that documentation-only changes and minor code cleanups are not considered CVE-worthy. This commit is even more trivial than those examples as it only adds comments. 5. **No security implications**: Adding documentation comments cannot introduce, fix, or affect any security vulnerabilities. The struct members already existed and were functioning; this just documents their purpose.
41df56b1fc24c drm/amd/display: Use Nominal vBlank If Provided Instead Of Capping It
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a display timing calculation adjustment in the AMD GPU driver's Display Memory Logic (DML) code. The change modifies how vBlank (vertical blanking) intervals are calculated for display startup timing. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - The commit removes the capping logic that limited `vblank_nom` to `vblank_nom_default_in_line` - Changes `vblank_avail` calculation to use the full `timing->vblank_nom` value when provided - Adjusts the interlaced mode calculation to use `(vblank_size - 1) / 2.0` instead of `vblank_size / 2.0` 3. **No security implications**: - This is purely a display timing optimization in GPU driver code - No memory safety issues, bounds violations, or overflow conditions are being fixed - No privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service vulnerabilities - The changes are mathematical adjustments to display timing calculations - No user input validation issues or attack surfaces 4. **Context from similar commits**: - Similar display timing commits in the reference set (commits 1-4) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - Only commit 5, which fixed an actual array bounds check issue, was assigned a CVE - The UBSAN warning fix I found (eaf3adb8faab) addressed an actual overflow condition but this commit does not This is a functional improvement to display timing calculations that allows better utilization of available vBlank time, not a security fix.
935e7cb5bb801 tools/build: Don't pass test log files to linker
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes: **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** 1. **Build system improvement, not a security fix**: This commit modifies the build system's Makefile to properly handle test log files separately from object files during linking. The change filters out files ending with `_log` from being passed to the linker. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes show: - Adding `test-y := $(filter %_log, $(obj-y))` to separate log files - Removing log files from object list: `obj-y := $(filter-out %_log, $(obj-y))` - Maintaining dependency on test logs but not passing them to linker 3. **Build correctness issue**: This appears to fix a build system issue where test log files were incorrectly being passed to the linker along with object files. The linker (`ld -r`) would fail or produce incorrect results when given non-object files. 4. **Tools-only change**: This only affects the build system under `tools/build/`, not kernel code that runs in production. It's part of the development toolchain. 5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant behavior being fixed. It's purely a build-time improvement. The commit is similar to the reference commits shown (Linux version updates in Makefile) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - both are build system changes without security implications.
e8d2d287e26d9 i3c: master: svc: Fix implicit fallthrough in svc_i3c_master_ibi_work()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a missing `break` statement in a switch case that was causing an implicit fallthrough warning from Clang. The actual functional fix was already implemented in the referenced commit (0430bf9bc1ac), which added the `svc_i3c_master_emit_stop(master);` call for the MASTER_REQUEST case. This commit simply adds the missing `break` statement to satisfy compiler warnings about proper switch/case structure. The issue is: 1. **Purely cosmetic/compiler warning fix** - The code was already functionally correct after the previous fix 2. **No security impact** - This is addressing a code style/compiler warning issue, not a vulnerability 3. **No behavioral change** - The fallthrough to the default case (which also just breaks) had no functional impact 4. **Protocol compliance** - The underlying issue (fixed in the parent commit) was about I3C bus protocol compliance, not security This is a code quality improvement to eliminate compiler warnings, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
12df9ec3e1955 platform/x86/intel: hid: Add Pantherlake support
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed** - This commit is simply adding hardware support for a new Intel platform (Panther Lake) by adding its ACPI device ID "INTC10CC" to the existing device ID table. 2. **The changes are purely additive** - The commit only: - Adds one new device ID entry `{ "INTC10CC" }` - Performs cosmetic cleanup by removing unnecessary ", 0" from existing entries - These changes don't fix any security issue or vulnerability 3. **Similar to reference commits** - This follows the same pattern as the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), which all add device IDs for new hardware platforms and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Examples include: - Adding Panther Lake PCI IDs to HID drivers - Adding Panther Lake support to audio drivers - Adding Panther Lake IDs to other Intel platform drivers 4. **Driver functionality** - The Intel HID driver is a simple hotkey/button event driver that handles ACPI events for special keys on Intel platforms. Adding support for new hardware doesn't introduce or fix any security concerns. 5. **No security-sensitive code changes** - The commit doesn't modify any logic, memory handling, access control, or any other security-sensitive aspects of the driver. This is a routine hardware enablement patch that adds support for upcoming Intel hardware, with no security implications whatsoever.
d6fe0c69b3aa5 btrfs: handle empty eb->folios in num_extent_folios()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit **should NOT be assigned a CVE**. Here's my reasoning: **NO** This commit fixes a potential NULL pointer dereference that would cause a segfault when `eb->folios[0]` is NULL. However, this does not qualify as a security vulnerability for the following reasons: 1. **No security boundary crossed**: The crash would occur in kernel space, but there's no evidence that this can be triggered from userspace in a way that would violate security boundaries. The extent buffer management is internal to btrfs filesystem operations. 2. **Defensive programming fix**: The commit message and code suggest this is a defensive programming improvement rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability. The fix adds a NULL check to prevent a theoretical crash scenario. 3. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: A NULL pointer dereference leading to a kernel crash (DoS) alone doesn't constitute a security vulnerability unless it can be reliably triggered by unprivileged users or leads to memory corruption that could be exploited. 4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, other btrfs fixes for potential crashes or NULL pointer handling (like "btrfs: fix two misuses of folio_shift()" and "btrfs: fix folio refcount in __alloc_dummy_extent_buffer()") were marked as NO CVE despite fixing potential issues. 5. **Internal consistency fix**: The function is used internally within btrfs for iterating over extent buffer folios. The NULL check ensures the function returns a sensible value (0) when the extent buffer has no folios allocated, which is a reasonable defensive programming practice. While this fix prevents a potential kernel crash, it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
1ed591582b7b8 drm/xe/display: Remove hpd cancel work sync from runtime pm path
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a deadlock fix in the runtime power management path, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses a potential deadlock scenario where `intel_hpd_cancel_work()` could synchronously wait for work items that might try to acquire runtime PM references, creating a circular dependency. 2. **Functional Bug, Not Security Issue**: The deadlock would cause system hangs or freezes during runtime suspend, which is a functional/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. There's no: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Access control bypass 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The runtime PM suspend path is triggered by power management events and user inactivity, not directly exploitable by unprivileged users. An attacker cannot trigger this deadlock condition at will. 4. **Similar Pattern to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (suspend/resume ordering fix) - NO CVE - Similar Commit 2 (debug messages) - NO CVE - Similar Commit 3 (duplicate call removal) - NO CVE - Similar Commit 4 (HPD refcount fix) - NO CVE 5. **Code Analysis**: The change simply adds a runtime check to skip `intel_hpd_cancel_work()` during runtime suspend while keeping it for system suspend. This is a targeted fix that prevents the deadlock without introducing new vulnerabilities. The only similar commit with a CVE (Similar Commit 5) was assigned one because it fixed an actual crash (BUG) that could be triggered, affecting system availability. This current commit prevents a deadlock but doesn't fix an exploitable crash condition.
21925ede449e0 f2fs: introduce f2fs_base_attr for global sysfs entries
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit is purely a code refactoring that introduces a new `f2fs_base_attr` structure for global sysfs entries in `/sys/fs/f2fs/features`. The commit message clearly states this is to "avoid to get the pointer" to `f2fs_sb_info` for global features that don't have an associated filesystem instance. 2. **No NULL Pointer Dereference Issue**: While the old code passed an `sbi` parameter to `f2fs_feature_show()`, that parameter was never actually used within the function. The function simply returned "supported\n" without accessing the `sbi` pointer. The container_of() in `f2fs_attr_show()` would have returned an invalid pointer when called on the global features kobject, but since `f2fs_feature_show()` never dereferenced it, there was no actual vulnerability. 3. **Architectural Improvement**: This is a design improvement that properly separates global filesystem features (which don't need an sbi instance) from per-instance filesystem attributes (which do need sbi). The new `f2fs_base_attr` structure and associated `f2fs_feat_attr_ops` handlers properly handle attributes that don't require filesystem instance information. 4. **No Security Impact**: The change doesn't fix any crashes, memory corruption, information leaks, or other security-relevant issues. It's a proactive code cleanup that makes the architecture more correct and maintainable. The commit improves code correctness by avoiding passing potentially invalid pointers to functions that don't need them, but since those pointers were never dereferenced, there was no actual security vulnerability to fix.
573f99c7585f5 Revert "arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: Use RSB for AXP805 PMIC connection"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit reverts a change from RSB (Reduced Serial Bus) back to I2C for PMIC communication. The issue described is "communication with PMIC via RSB can intermittently fail" - this is a reliability/stability issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Hardware Configuration Change**: The changes are purely device tree modifications that switch the communication protocol between the SoC and the PMIC (Power Management IC). The device addressing changes from `reg = <0x745>` (RSB address) back to `reg = <0x36>` (I2C address). 3. **Performance Trade-off**: The original commit switched to RSB for "higher bus frequency" and "more CPU-efficient" operation. The revert acknowledges that "higher speed and efficiency isn't worth the trouble" due to intermittent failures. 4. **No Security Impact**: There's no indication of: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Access control bypass - Data exposure - System compromise potential 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Like the similar commits shown (interrupt number fixes, RS485 polarity fixes, naming fixes), this is a hardware configuration correction that ensures proper operation but doesn't fix a security vulnerability. The intermittent communication failures mentioned would likely manifest as system instability or power management issues, but not as exploitable security vulnerabilities.
f3c2d243a36ef bpf: abort verification if env->cur_state->loop_entry != NULL
- [sasha] Now I'll analyze the commit to understand its security implications: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Bug fix for defensive programming**: The change converts a WARN_ON_ONCE condition that nullified the problematic state into a hard failure that aborts verification with -EFAULT. The original bug (bbbc02b7445e) already prevented any security issue by setting `loop_entry = NULL` when the unexpected condition was detected. 2. **Internal verifier correctness check**: The code change is in the BPF verifier's internal state management. When `env->cur_state->loop_entry != NULL` after `pop_stack()`, it indicates an internal verifier bug, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited. 3. **No security boundary crossed**: The verifier would already reject any potentially unsafe BPF program. This change just makes the internal error handling more robust by failing fast instead of trying to continue with a corrected state. 4. **Defense in depth improvement**: The original commit (bbbc02b7445e) that this fixes was also not a security vulnerability - it was a correctness fix that prevented the verifier from accepting unsafe programs. The commit message even states "program that is not safe yet is accepted by verifier w/o this fix", but the actual impact was on verification performance, not security. 5. **Verifier bugs != security vulnerabilities**: Not all BPF verifier bugs are security vulnerabilities. For a CVE, there needs to be a way to bypass security checks and load unsafe BPF programs. This commit strengthens an existing safety check rather than fixing a bypass. The change from: ```c if (WARN_ON_ONCE(env->cur_state->loop_entry)) env->cur_state->loop_entry = NULL; ``` to: ```c if (WARN_ON_ONCE(env->cur_state->loop_entry)) { verbose(env, "verifier bug: env->cur_state->loop_entry != NULL\n"); return -EFAULT; } ``` This is a robustness improvement that converts a warning with recovery into a hard failure, which is the proper response to an "irrecoverably buggy" state as mentioned in the commit message.
36adf6fe6cbe5 selftests/sched_ext: Update test enq_select_cpu_fails
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination: **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. This commit is purely a test suite update that: 1. **Updates tests to reflect changed functionality** - The commit updates selftests to match the new behavior where `scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl()` can be called from multiple contexts (ops.select_cpu(), ops.enqueue(), and BPF test_run), which was enabled by a previous commit. 2. **No kernel code changes** - All changes are confined to the tools/testing/selftests/ directory. There are no modifications to actual kernel code that could introduce security vulnerabilities. 3. **Test renaming** - The test was renamed from "enq_select_cpu_fails" to "enq_select_cpu" because the behavior changed from expecting failure to expecting success when calling the function from ops.enqueue(). 4. **Adds test coverage** - The new test adds validation for calling `scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl()` from different contexts including BPF test_run, which improves test coverage. The actual security-relevant change that enabled calling `scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl()` from multiple contexts was done in commit a730e3f7a48b ("sched_ext: idle: Consolidate default idle CPU selection kfuncs"), not in this test update commit. This is just a test suite update to validate the new behavior.
214c13e380ad7 SUNRPC: rpcbind should never reset the port to the value '0'
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the surrounding code context, here is my determination: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Explanation: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It prevents a logical error where an already-bound RPC service (with a valid port) could have its port reset to 0 by rpcbind, but this is a functionality/robustness issue rather than a security flaw. 2. **Impact Analysis**: The code change prevents `xprt->ops->set_port(xprt, 0)` from being called when `map->r_port` is 0. Before this fix, if rpcbind returned port 0 (indicating the service wasn't registered), it would: - Call `set_port(xprt, 0)` which sets the port to 0 - NOT call `xprt_set_bound(xprt)` because the condition `if (map->r_port)` would be false This could leave the transport in an inconsistent state where it had port 0 but might still be considered bound from a previous successful binding. 3. **No Security Consequences**: The issue appears to be a service availability/functionality problem rather than a security vulnerability. Setting the port to 0 would likely cause connection failures or service disruptions, but there's no evidence of: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Authentication bypass - Remote code execution 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fixed actual security issues like NULL pointer dereferences causing kernel crashes - This commit is more similar to the "CVE Status: NO" commits that made code improvements or fixed non-security bugs The commit improves robustness by preventing an invalid state transition but does not address any security vulnerability.
9e01aaa1033d6 crypto: ahash - Set default reqsize from ahash_alg
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Feature enhancement, not a bug fix**: The commit adds a convenience feature to allow algorithm developers to set a default `reqsize` value directly in the `ahash_alg` structure instead of requiring them to implement an `init_tfm` function. This is purely a code simplification feature. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes show: - Adding a new `reqsize` field to `struct ahash_alg` - Setting the reqsize from this field in `crypto_ahash_init_tfm()` - Adding validation that `reqsize` must be >= `statesize` if specified 3. **Proper validation added**: The commit actually adds a safety check (`if (alg->reqsize && alg->reqsize < alg->halg.statesize) return -EINVAL;`) which prevents incorrect configuration, making the code safer rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. 4. **No memory corruption or security issues**: The `reqsize` field determines how much memory is allocated for request contexts (`ahash_request_alloc` allocates `sizeof(struct ahash_request) + crypto_ahash_reqsize(tfm)`). Before this commit, algorithms without `init_tfm` would get whatever reqsize was set by default mechanisms. This commit just provides another way to set it. 5. **Compare to similar commits with CVEs**: The similar commits that received CVEs (like the bcm and qat commits) fixed actual bugs where: - Error return values were not checked, potentially leading to use of uninitialized data - Input validation was missing, potentially leading to integer underflows - Memory management errors that could cause crashes or corruption This commit is a clean feature addition that improves the API without fixing any security vulnerability.
4441b976dfeff hrtimers: Replace hrtimer_clock_to_base_table with switch-case
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is a code cleanup that replaces a lookup table with a switch-case statement to fix a compiler warning about overlapped initializers when building with `W=1` and `CONFIG_WERROR=y`. The change has no security implications: 1. The original code already had proper bounds checking for invalid clock IDs 2. Both implementations handle errors safely by returning a default value and issuing a WARN() 3. The functionality is identical - it's purely a stylistic change to avoid compiler warnings 4. The commit message clearly states this is to fix a build warning, not a security issue This is similar to the first reference commit which also fixed a compiler warning (unused function) and was correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO".
8ae6dfc0b61b1 Revert "drm/amd/display: Request HW cursor on DCN3.2 with SubVP"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change reverts a feature that caused "idle power regression" - this is a power consumption/performance issue, not a security vulnerability. The original commit prevented SubVP (Sub-Viewport) from being enabled when hardware cursor was requested to support larger cursor sizes (up to 256x256 instead of 64x64). 2. **Display Feature Optimization**: The code change only affects display pipeline optimization decisions - specifically whether to enable SubVP based on cursor requirements. SubVP appears to be a power-saving display feature that has trade-offs with cursor size limitations. 3. **No Security-Sensitive Components**: The change doesn't involve: - Memory management vulnerabilities - Access control bypasses - Input validation issues - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Any form of unauthorized access 4. **Pure Performance/Power Trade-off**: The revert addresses an "idle power regression" - meaning the original change caused increased power consumption during idle states. This is a quality/performance issue, not a security concern. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also display driver reverts that address visual corruption, performance regressions, or power consumption issues - none of which are security vulnerabilities. The change is purely removing a conditional check (`!pipe->stream->hw_cursor_req`) that prevented SubVP from being used when hardware cursor was requested. This is a display feature configuration decision with no security implications.
67dfc11982f7e powerpc/pseries/iommu: create DDW for devices with DMA mask less than 64-bits
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my determination: **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **New Feature, Not a Fix**: This commit implements a new feature to support Limited Addressing Mode for PowerPC devices with DMA masks between 32-64 bits. It does not fix any existing security vulnerability or bug. 2. **No Fixes: Tag**: The absence of a "Fixes:" tag indicates this is not addressing a pre-existing issue. 3. **Feature Enhancement**: The change enables DDW (Direct DMA Window) support for devices that previously couldn't use it due to DMA mask limitations. This is an enhancement to support newer hardware capabilities (PAPR level 2.13). 4. **No Security Impact**: While the code does add new functionality, it doesn't address any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues. The changes are about extending DMA addressing support. 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Unlike the example commits with CVE status "YES" which fix actual crashes, memory corruption issues, or IOMMU table marking problems that cause system OOPSes, this commit adds new functionality without fixing any vulnerability. While there is a potential null pointer dereference risk in the `limited_dma_window()` function where `pdn->phb->buid` is accessed without proper validation, this is in newly added code (not fixing an existing vulnerability) and would be considered a bug in the new feature implementation rather than a security vulnerability fix.
e92f3f94cad24 drm/amdgpu: reset psp->cmd to NULL after releasing the buffer
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze this commit: **Analysis:** The commit changes the `psp_sw_fini()` function to properly reset `psp->cmd` to NULL after freeing it. The original code had a bug where: 1. It created a local variable `cmd = psp->cmd` 2. It freed the memory with `kfree(cmd)` 3. It set the local variable `cmd = NULL` (which has no effect on `psp->cmd`) 4. **The `psp->cmd` pointer was left dangling, pointing to freed memory** The fix correctly sets `psp->cmd = NULL` after freeing, which prevents potential use-after-free vulnerabilities. Looking at the code, `psp->cmd` is accessed in the `acquire_psp_cmd_buf()` function (line 763), which is called by many functions throughout the driver. If the driver were to be unloaded (calling `psp_sw_fini()`) and then reloaded or if certain error paths were hit, the dangling pointer could be dereferenced, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. This is a classic use-after-free pattern where: - Memory is freed but the pointer is not nullified - The pointer can be accessed later through various code paths - This could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially exploitable conditions **NO** While this commit fixes a coding error (not properly nullifying a pointer after free), it does not appear to fix an exploitable security vulnerability. The key reasons are: 1. The `psp_sw_fini()` function is only called during driver cleanup/shutdown paths 2. After `psp_sw_fini()` is called, the entire `psp_context` structure would typically be deallocated, making the dangling pointer moot 3. There's no evidence of code paths that would access `psp->cmd` after `psp_sw_fini()` without going through `psp_sw_init()` first (which allocates a new buffer) 4. This appears to be a defensive programming fix to prevent potential future issues rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" all fixed actual null pointer dereferences where the code would crash or behave incorrectly during normal operation. This commit, in contrast, fixes a theoretical issue in cleanup code that doesn't appear to have exploitable consequences in practice.
a158a937d864d smack: recognize ipv4 CIPSO w/o categories
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment: **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Explanation: 1. **Not a Security Vulnerability Fix**: This commit fixes a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that SMACK incorrectly labels incoming IPv4 packets with CIPSO labels that have no categories - it substitutes the '*' (star) label instead of recognizing the correct label. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While the mislabeling causes packets to be processed with incorrect security labels, this actually results in: - More restrictive behavior (packets get denied as shown in the audit log example) - Access control still functions, just with the wrong label - The star ('*') label is a generic label that doesn't grant special privileges 3. **No Privilege Escalation or Bypass**: The bug doesn't allow: - Bypassing security policies - Gaining unauthorized access - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure 4. **Functionality Issue**: This is primarily a correctness issue where SMACK fails to properly recognize valid CIPSO labels without categories, leading to incorrect labeling but not security bypass. 5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar historical commits, the "smack: ipv4/ipv6: tcp/dccp/sctp: fix incorrect child socket label" (marked as NO CVE) also dealt with incorrect labeling issues but wasn't assigned a CVE because it was a functionality fix rather than a security vulnerability. The commit improves the correctness of SMACK's CIPSO label handling but doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
eba692ca3abca drm/amd/display: Call FP Protect Before Mode Programming/Mode Support
- [sasha] Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This is a code reorganization/refactoring to properly place FP (floating-point) protection macros. The commit moves `DC_FP_START()/DC_FP_END()` calls from the outer `dml21_validate()` function to the specific inner functions that actually perform floating-point calculations. 2. **Kernel taint issue, not security**: The commit message states "May cause kernel to be tainted due to usage of FP Start" when memory allocation occurs. This is about kernel debugging/warning messages, not a security vulnerability. A tainted kernel is a debugging concept indicating the kernel is in an unexpected state, not a security compromise. 3. **No exploitable condition**: The issue being fixed is that memory allocation (which can sleep) was happening inside FP-protected sections, which causes warnings because FP protection disables preemption. This is a correctness issue that could trigger kernel warnings, not a security vulnerability. 4. **Pattern differs from CVE-worthy commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - The one marked "CVE Status: YES" (bd3e84bc98f8) fixes an actual bug that caused corruption and invalid memory access - The ones marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar FP protection placement fixes like this one 5. **No memory corruption or privilege escalation**: The change simply moves where FP protection is enabled to avoid kernel warnings when memory allocation occurs. There's no fix for memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issues. This is a code quality improvement to avoid kernel warnings/taints, not a security vulnerability fix.
d73a4bfa2881a HID: usbkbd: Fix the bit shift number for LED_KANA
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The bug causes LED_KANA to be incorrectly shifted by 3 bits instead of 4 bits. This results in the KANA LED status being written to the same bit position as LED_COMPOSE (both shifted by 3), causing a functional issue where the KANA LED cannot be controlled independently. 2. **No memory corruption or overflow**: The newleds value is a simple bitfield that gets written to a 1-byte USB control transfer. Even with the incorrect shift, all values remain within the valid 8-bit range (0-255). There's no buffer overflow, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption. 3. **Limited impact**: The bug only affects the LED control functionality of USB keyboards that have a KANA LED (primarily Japanese keyboards). It doesn't affect: - Data input or keystroke processing - System security or integrity - Memory safety - Privilege levels 4. **No exploitable condition**: An attacker cannot leverage this bug to: - Execute arbitrary code - Escalate privileges - Cause denial of service - Access sensitive information The commit simply fixes a copy-paste error where LED_KANA was given the same shift value (3) as LED_COMPOSE, when it should have been 4 to match its definition as 0x04. This is a quality/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
5e73276c814fc wifi: ath12k: report station mode receive rate for IEEE 802.11be
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit is adding missing functionality for IEEE 802.11be (EHT) receive rate reporting. The code changes show it's simply adding a new case (`RX_MSDU_START_PKT_TYPE_11BE`) to handle EHT packet types in the receive path. 2. **Cosmetic/Reporting Issue**: The problem being fixed is that "iw dev xxx station dump" shows invalid/incorrect receive rates for EHT connections. This is purely a userspace reporting issue - the actual data reception was working, just the rate wasn't being properly reported to mac80211. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The code properly validates the MCS rate (`if (rate_mcs > ATH12K_EHT_MCS_MAX)`) and logs a warning if invalid, similar to the existing HE case. There's no buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other security-relevant bug being fixed. 4. **Feature Addition**: The changes are adding support for a missing feature (EHT rate reporting) rather than fixing a vulnerability. The enum additions (`RX_MSDU_START_PKT_TYPE_11BA`, `RX_MSDU_START_PKT_TYPE_11BE`) and the new case handler are extending functionality. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This is very similar to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - particularly the first one about 6 GHz frequency correction and the third one about RX bandwidth reporting. All are fixing incorrect reporting/display issues without any security implications. The commit is a straightforward feature addition/completion for 802.11be support in the ath12k driver, with no security vulnerabilities being addressed.
255e7bc2127cb ext4: Make ext4_meta_trans_blocks() non-static for later use
- [sasha] Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No security vulnerability fix**: This is a preparatory refactoring commit that changes a function from `static` to non-static (exported) for use in later patches. The commit message explicitly states it's "for later use" in atomic writes feature development. 2. **No functional changes**: The commit only changes the visibility scope of `ext4_meta_trans_blocks()` from file-local (static) to module-wide. The function implementation remains identical - it still calculates the number of metadata transaction blocks needed for journal operations. 3. **Part of a feature series**: This is part of a larger atomic writes feature implementation series, not a fix for any existing issue. The function is being made available for use in subsequent patches that implement atomic write support. 4. **No security implications**: The function simply calculates journal credit estimates based on the number of logical blocks and physical extents. Making it non-static doesn't introduce any security risks - it's just exposing an existing utility function for broader use within the ext4 module. 5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern - it's a code refactoring/preparation change without any security implications.
28d68d396a1cd bonding: report duplicate MAC address in all situations
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the logic change more carefully: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a diagnostic improvement that extends warning coverage, not a security vulnerability fix. The change modifies the condition from: ```c if (!all && (!bond->params.fail_over_mac || BOND_MODE(bond) != BOND_MODE_ACTIVEBACKUP)) ``` to: ```c if (!all && (bond->params.fail_over_mac != BOND_FOM_ACTIVE || BOND_MODE(bond) != BOND_MODE_ACTIVEBACKUP)) ``` 2. **What it does**: The change makes the warning message about duplicate MAC addresses display in more situations: - Previously: Warning shown when fail_over_mac=0 (BOND_FOM_NONE) OR not in active-backup mode - Now: Warning shown when fail_over_mac!=1 (not BOND_FOM_ACTIVE) OR not in active-backup mode - This means the warning now also appears when fail_over_mac=2 (BOND_FOM_FOLLOW) 3. **Security impact**: None. This change only affects when a warning message is displayed to inform administrators about a potentially confusing configuration. The underlying behavior of the bonding driver remains unchanged - it's purely a diagnostic improvement. 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: - The "CVE Status: YES" example fixed an actual bug where the IFF_SLAVE flag was incorrectly cleared, breaking functionality - The "CVE Status: NO" examples fixed functional issues but not security vulnerabilities - This commit only adds warning coverage and doesn't fix any functional or security issue The commit improves user experience by providing better diagnostic information but does not address any security vulnerability.
33f17e2cbd930 drm/xe/pf: Reset GuC VF config when unprovisioning critical resource
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific security implications of this commit: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Not a Security Fix**: The commit addresses a functional error handling issue where GuC firmware validation fails when resources are unprovisioned. The error scenario shown in the commit message (`Input/output error`) is a benign operational failure, not a security vulnerability. 2. **No Exploitable Condition**: The issue being fixed is: - GuC firmware counts configuration KLVs and validates VF config - When critical resources are unprovisioned, GuC validation fails - This results in an I/O error when trying to provision new resources This is purely a functional bug that prevents proper configuration changes, not a security vulnerability. 3. **The Fix is Preventive**: The addition of `pf_refresh_vf_cfg()` calls after unprovisioning resources simply ensures GuC's configuration state is reset to prevent validation errors. This is housekeeping, not security hardening. 4. **No Security Impact**: Unlike the previous UAF commit (89076b5a8b4e) which fixed an actual use-after-free vulnerability, this commit: - Does not fix memory corruption - Does not fix unauthorized access - Does not fix information leaks - Does not fix privilege escalation - Does not fix any exploitable condition 5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this is more like: - "drm/xe/pf: Don't send BEGIN_ID if VF has no context/doorbells" (NO CVE) - "drm/xe/vf: Don't touch GuC irq registers if using memory irqs" (NO CVE) These are configuration/validation fixes, not security fixes. The commit simply ensures proper cleanup of GuC firmware state when unprovisioning VF resources to avoid benign validation errors during subsequent provisioning attempts.
1c7c7388e6c31 tools/power turbostat: Clustered Uncore MHz counters should honor show/hide options
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual commit about turbostat: **NO** This commit is a purely cosmetic/UI fix for the turbostat power monitoring tool. The changes are: 1. **File modified**: `tools/power/x86/turbostat/` - This is a userspace power monitoring tool, not kernel code 2. **Nature of change**: The commit fixes how clustered uncore frequency counters (UMHz*.*) respond to the --show and --hide command-line options 3. **What it fixes**: Previously, UMHz*.* counters would appear even when using `--show` to display only specific counters. Now they properly honor show/hide options by grouping them with the legacy "UncMHz" counter The key code change is in the conditional check: ```c if BIC_IS_ENABLED(BIC_UNCORE_MHZ) add_counter(0, path, name_buf, 0, SCOPE_PACKAGE, COUNTER_K2M, FORMAT_AVERAGE, 0, package_id); ``` This is a userspace tool bug fix with no security implications: - No kernel code is affected - No privilege escalation possible - No memory corruption or crashes - No information disclosure - Just a display/formatting issue in a diagnostic tool This is similar to the other turbostat commits shown as examples (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), which were also userspace tool improvements with no security impact.
8d3ca331026a7 NFS: Don't allow waiting for exiting tasks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is a robustness improvement, not a security fix. It prevents NFS code from entering killable waits when a task is already exiting (PF_EXITING flag set). 2. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds checks for `nfs_current_task_exiting()` which returns true when `current->flags & PF_EXITING`. This prevents the NFS client from trying to wait on signals for tasks that can no longer receive signals after calling `exit_signals()`. 3. **Impact Analysis**: - This is a race condition avoidance mechanism - It prevents potential hangs or unexpected behavior when NFS operations are in progress during task exit - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure risk 4. **No Fixes Tag**: The commit doesn't have a "Fixes:" tag, suggesting it's not addressing a specific bug but rather improving robustness. 5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This is similar to the first two reference commits that also made NFS/NFSD improvements without security implications and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". The change is a defensive programming practice that ensures NFS operations handle exiting tasks gracefully, but it doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
c20ad96c9a8f0 x86/traps: Cleanup and robustify decode_bug()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a cleanup and robustness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message clearly states "Cleanup and robustify decode_bug()". 2. **The MOD == 3 issue**: When the ModRM byte has MOD == 3, it indicates register-to-register addressing with no memory operand or displacement. The old code would incorrectly attempt to read an immediate value that doesn't exist in this encoding, but: - This would only trigger a WARN_ONCE() with "Unexpected MODRM_MOD", not a security issue - The function would still return BUG_UD1 and continue execution - No memory corruption or privilege escalation would occur 3. **Instruction length calculation**: The addition of instruction length tracking is for reliability ("such that WARN like bugs can more reliably skip to the correct instruction"), not security. 4. **Code flow analysis**: The old code path for MOD == 3 would: - Hit the else clause and WARN_ONCE() - Set *imm = 0 (already initialized) - Return BUG_UD1 This is incorrect behavior but not exploitable. 5. **Context**: This function is used in exception handling for debugging features (UBSAN, static_call, etc.), not in security-critical paths. The commit improves code correctness and robustness but does not fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
3f981138109f6 sch_hfsc: Fix qlen accounting bug when using peek in hfsc_enqueue()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Use-After-Free Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states that the bug can lead to "use-after-free" conditions. UAF vulnerabilities are serious security issues that can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution or denial of service. 2. **Queueing Inconsistency Leading to Security Consequences**: The code change shows that the bug causes inconsistent queue accounting where `qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()` is called when the parent qdisc's qlen/backlog hasn't been updated yet. This can leave empty HFSC classes in the active list, violating HFSC's fundamental assumption that only non-empty classes should be in the active list. 3. **Similar Pattern to CVE-Assigned Commits**: This follows the same pattern as other HFSC UAF vulnerabilities that were assigned CVEs (like commits 3df275ef0a6a and 141d34391abb). All involve race conditions or ordering issues in HFSC that can lead to use-after-free conditions. 4. **Remote Triggerable**: Network packet scheduling can be influenced by remote traffic patterns, making this potentially exploitable remotely through specially crafted traffic patterns. 5. **Clear Security Researcher Report**: The issue was reported by Mingi Cho from theori.io, suggesting this was found through security research rather than normal bug finding. The fix is simple but critical - moving the qlen/backlog increment before the peek() call ensures proper accounting and prevents the UAF condition from occurring.
7fe0353606d77 net: ethernet: mtk_ppe_offload: Allow QinQ, double ETH_P_8021Q only
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit is a feature enhancement that adds QinQ (double VLAN tagging) support to the MediaTek PPE (Packet Processing Engine) offload functionality. It is not fixing a security vulnerability. Key observations: 1. **Feature addition, not a fix**: The commit adds new functionality to support double VLAN tagging (QinQ), which was previously limited to single VLAN tags. This is explicitly stated in the commit message as adding support for a feature. 2. **No security issues addressed**: The changes: - Convert a single VLAN storage to an array of 2 VLANs - Update bounds checking from `data.vlan.num == 1` to `data.vlan.num + data.pppoe.num == 2` - Change from storing single VLAN to iterating through VLAN array 3. **Proper bounds checking maintained**: The code maintains proper bounds checking throughout: - Still limits total tags to 2 (VLAN + PPPoE) - Array is fixed size of 2 elements - Access is controlled by `data.vlan.num` counter 4. **No exploitable issues fixed**: There's no indication of fixing buffer overflows, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or any other security-relevant issues. The previous code wasn't vulnerable - it just didn't support the QinQ feature. This is similar to the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" which were also feature additions or performance improvements in the networking stack without security implications.
f024d3a8ded0d io_uring/fdinfo: annotate racy sq/cq head/tail reads
- [sasha] Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Impact**: The commit only adds `data_race()` annotations to reads in the fdinfo display path (`io_uring_show_fdinfo`). This is purely informational output shown in `/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd]` and has no impact on io_uring's actual operation or security. 2. **Diagnostic/Debugging Purpose Only**: The fdinfo interface is used for debugging and monitoring purposes only. As the commit message states, these reads are "known racy" because they provide a snapshot view that may be outdated immediately after reading - this is expected behavior, not a vulnerability. 3. **No Functional Change**: The `data_race()` macro only suppresses KCSAN (Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer) warnings without changing any runtime behavior. It's a hint to tooling that the race condition here is intentional and harmless. 4. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the first example commit about annotating data races in `net_sched`, which was marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both are adding annotations to suppress sanitizer warnings for known benign races. 5. **Access Already Protected**: The fdinfo interface requires appropriate permissions (PTRACE_MODE_READ) to access, further limiting any theoretical impact. The racy reads being annotated don't lead to any security issues - they simply mean the displayed values might be slightly stale, which is acceptable for diagnostic output.
e764295a270ce selftests/sched_ext: Add test for scx_bpf_select_cpu_and() via test_run
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the surrounding context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit is purely adding a test case for the `scx_bpf_select_cpu_and()` function when called via BPF test_run. Here's why this does not warrant a CVE: 1. **Test-only change**: The commit only adds test code in the selftests directory. It does not modify any kernel production code or introduce any vulnerabilities. 2. **Testing existing functionality**: The test is validating the behavior of `scx_bpf_select_cpu_and()` when called from an unlocked context via BPF test_run, which was already enabled in commit 4ac760bdf2b6. 3. **Proper security controls**: The test shows proper security practices: - Uses `bpf_task_from_pid()` which requires appropriate permissions - Properly acquires RCU locks before calling the function - Releases resources correctly with `bpf_task_release()` 4. **No security impact**: The test doesn't expose any new attack surface or security vulnerability. It's simply exercising an existing API path through the BPF test_run interface, which already has its own permission checks. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike commit 9360dfe4cbd6 (CVE Status: YES) which fixed a kernel crash vulnerability by adding validation for invalid CPU values, this commit is just adding test coverage for legitimate usage of the API. The commit is a normal part of test development to ensure the scheduler extension functionality works correctly when called from different contexts. It does not fix any security vulnerability nor does it introduce one.
1d4c06d51963f kunit: tool: Fix bug in parsing test plan
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Tool-only change**: The bug fix is in `tools/testing/kunit/kunit_parser.py`, which is a userspace Python script used for parsing KUnit test results. This is not kernel code - it's a development/testing tool that runs outside the kernel. 2. **No security impact**: The bug causes an infinite loop in a test result parser when encountering a specific KTAP format pattern. This is purely a functionality bug in a development tool, not a security vulnerability. The infinite loop only affects the parsing tool itself, not the kernel or any production systems. 3. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects developers/testers who: - Run KUnit tests - Use the kunit_parser.py tool to parse results - Have test output in the specific format that triggers the bug (test result followed by test plan) 4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The bug doesn't allow: - Unauthorized access to system resources - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Memory corruption - Any other security-relevant impact Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual kernel vulnerabilities (use-after-free in kthread references, null pointer dereferences in kernel code), this is just a parsing bug in a userspace development tool.
3394b1f76d3f8 drm/amdgpu: Set snoop bit for SDMA for MI series
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security fix**: The commit is enabling cache snooping/probe-invalidation for SDMA (System DMA) operations on MI series GPUs. This is a correctness/performance feature, not a security vulnerability fix. 2. **Hardware configuration change**: The code changes are setting hardware configuration bits (bit 15) in GPU snoop override registers to ensure SDMA writes properly invalidate cache lines. This is about maintaining cache coherency, which is a correctness issue rather than a security issue. 3. **No vulnerability mentioned**: The commit message states "SDMA writes has to probe invalidate RW lines" - this describes a functional requirement for correct operation, not a security vulnerability. There's no mention of any exploitable condition, privilege escalation, or security impact. 4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided, none of the commits that make similar hardware configuration changes (like setting HDP flush bits, implementing IRQ states, or using legacy HDP flush) were assigned CVEs. 5. **Feature enablement**: This appears to be enabling proper cache coherency behavior for MI series GPUs (AMD's data center GPUs), which is a feature/correctness enhancement rather than fixing an existing security vulnerability. The change ensures that when SDMA performs writes, the cache lines are properly invalidated to maintain coherency between different components accessing the same memory. While improper cache coherency could theoretically lead to data corruption, there's no indication this was causing any security-exploitable condition.
293e38ff4e4c2 net: lan743x: Restore SGMII CTRL register on resume
- [sasha] Perfect! So `lan743x_mdiobus_init` is called from `lan743x_pcidev_probe` (the probe function) but NOT from the resume path. This is the bug. **Answer: YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Clear Security Impact**: The commit fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability where network connectivity is completely lost after system resume when using SGMII interface configuration. The code shows that the SGMII_CTL register, which controls whether SGMII or RGMII interface is active, was not restored during resume. 2. **Incorrect Interface Selection**: As shown in the code changes, the SGMII_CTL register setup was only in `lan743x_mdiobus_init()` (called during probe) but not in the resume path. After resume, the hardware would be in an inconsistent state - potentially using the wrong network interface type. 3. **FPGA Security Implications**: The commit message specifically mentions "particularly in scenarios involving the FPGA", which could have additional security implications where FPGA-based security features might be bypassed due to incorrect interface selection. 4. **Long Vulnerability Window**: The bug was introduced in commit a46d9d37c4f4f (Feb 2022) and fixed in this commit, creating a multi-year window where affected systems were vulnerable. 5. **Similar to CVE-assigned Issues**: Looking at the similar commits, we see that CVE-2024-35895 was assigned to the mlx5e driver for a similar suspend/resume issue that caused NULL pointer dereference and system crashes. The PCI imx6 suspend/resume fix (commit 0a726f542d7c) also received a CVE for similar register restoration issues. The vulnerability manifests as complete network failure after resume, which is a clear availability/DoS issue worthy of CVE assignment.
cef721e0d53d2 um: Store full CSGSFS and SS register from mcontext
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Limited scope**: This is a change specific to User Mode Linux (UML), which is a special architecture that runs Linux as a user-space process. It's not a typical kernel vulnerability affecting production systems. 2. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The change is about fixing register handling compatibility between mcontext and ptrace interfaces. The commit message states it "allows using registers as retrieved from an mcontext to be pushed to a process using PTRACE_SETREGS" - this is a functional fix, not a security fix. 3. **No privilege escalation**: The previous code was forcing CPL (Current Privilege Level) to 3 (user mode) by doing `|= 3` on the CS register. The new code removes this forced privilege level setting, but: - UML already runs entirely in user space - This is about register state copying between different interfaces - There's no indication this could be exploited for privilege escalation 4. **The change adds functionality**: Rather than fixing a vulnerability, this change adds the SS register copy (`regs->gp[SS / sizeof(unsigned long)] = mc->gregs[REG_CSGSFS] >> 48;`) and removes the masking/forcing of CS register bits, which was causing compatibility issues with seccomp and ptrace. 5. **Similar to architectural updates**: This is similar to the example commits shown with "CVE Status: NO" that update register handling for architectural reasons (like FRED support) rather than fixing security vulnerabilities. The commit is a functional improvement for UML's register handling between different kernel interfaces, not a security vulnerability fix.
f0ddbb1eed189 drm/dp: add option to disable zero sized address only transactions.
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Hardware compatibility workaround**: This change is a workaround for specific NVIDIA hardware/firmware that incorrectly rejects legitimate zero-sized address-only transactions in the DisplayPort protocol. It's addressing a hardware limitation, not fixing a security vulnerability. 2. **No security impact**: The modification only changes the formatting of I2C-over-DP transactions by optionally skipping zero-sized packets that some hardware can't handle. There's no: - Memory corruption or buffer overflow - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Access control bypass - Denial of service vulnerability being fixed 3. **Opt-in behavior**: The `no_zero_sized` flag must be explicitly set by drivers (like nouveau for GB202+ chips). It doesn't change default behavior or introduce new attack vectors. 4. **Protocol flexibility**: Both transaction formats (with and without zero-sized packets) are valid according to the DP specification. The zero-sized packets are used to "properly reset connections" but aren't mandatory for correct operation. 5. **Similar non-CVE precedent**: The first similar commit that handled zero-sized AUX transactions differently was also not assigned a CVE, as it was addressing display functionality issues rather than security vulnerabilities. This is purely a functional enhancement to support hardware that doesn't fully comply with optional protocol features, not a security fix.
425b1c97b07f2 PNP: Expand length of fixup id string
- [sasha] ## Analysis **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a build warning fix that addresses a potential string termination issue detected by GCC 15's new `-Wunterminated-string-initialization` warning. Here's why it's not a security vulnerability: 1. **No actual security impact**: The code analysis shows that all actual PNP device IDs in the `pnp_fixups` array are 7 characters or less (e.g., "CTL0021", "PNP0c01"). The array was already sufficient to hold all real-world IDs. 2. **Defensive coding improvement**: The change from `char id[7]` to `char id[8]` ensures proper null termination for 7-character IDs, but this was already working correctly in practice because: - All actual IDs were shorter than 7 characters - The fixup array ends with an empty string `{""}` as a sentinel 3. **Only affects debugging output**: The ID is only used in: - Comparison operations (`compare_pnp_id()`) - Debug print statements (`pnp_dbg()`) - Neither of these would cause memory corruption or security issues 4. **Compiler warning fix**: This is addressing a new compiler warning rather than fixing an actual runtime issue. The commit message explicitly states it's to satisfy GCC 15's string initialization checks. This is similar to the other "CVE Status: NO" commits shown as examples - it's a string handling improvement for code correctness and compiler compatibility, not a fix for an exploitable vulnerability.
3dd3ab690172b pinctrl: qcom: msm8917: Add MSM8937 wsa_reset pin
- [sasha] Looking at this commit and comparing it to the similar commits provided: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This commit is adding hardware support for the MSM8937 variant by defining the `wsa_reset` pin function. The changes are: 1. **Adding pin function support** - The commit adds the `wsa_reset` function to the list of available pin functions for gpio96, which appears to be used for WSA (audio codec) reset functionality on MSM8937 hardware. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed** - This is purely additive hardware enablement. The commit: - Adds a new pin function enum `msm_mux_wsa_reset` - Defines which pins can use this function (`gpio96`) - Adds the function to the list of available functions - Updates Kconfig description to mention MSM8937 support 3. **Similar to non-CVE commits** - This follows the same pattern as: - Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed a Kconfig description typo - Commit 2 (NO CVE): Added PM8937 compatible string for hardware support 4. **Unlike CVE commits** - The CVE-assigned commits (3 and 5) fixed actual bugs: - Fixed incorrect pin offsets that caused system crashes - Fixed functional issues that prevented proper operation This commit does not fix any security vulnerability, crash, data corruption, or functional bug. It's simply adding missing hardware definition for the MSM8937 variant to support an additional pin function for audio codec reset.
85975daeaa4d6 cpuidle: menu: Avoid discarding useful information
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination: **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a performance optimization in the cpuidle menu governor that improves the accuracy of idle state predictions. The change modifies how the `get_typical_interval()` function returns values when it cannot make a high-confidence prediction. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It changes the return value from `UINT_MAX` to `max` (the current maximum recent interval) in certain cases. This is a heuristic improvement that: - Doesn't fix any memory corruption issues - Doesn't fix any privilege escalation - Doesn't fix any information disclosure - Doesn't fix any denial of service condition 3. **Functional improvement only**: The change improves the idle state prediction logic by using available historical data (the maximum observed interval) instead of completely discarding it when confidence is low. This leads to better power management decisions but has no security implications. 4. **No error conditions fixed**: The code doesn't fix any crash, panic, or error condition. It simply refines the prediction algorithm to make better use of available data. 5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This commit is similar in nature to the other cpufreq/cpuidle commits shown as examples (commits 1-5), which are all marked as "CVE Status: NO". They all involve performance optimizations, algorithm improvements, or documentation fixes rather than security fixes. The commit is a legitimate optimization that makes the cpuidle governor smarter about predicting idle intervals, but it contains no security-relevant fixes.
68c1f1671650b usb: xhci: set page size to the xHCI-supported size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit adds proper validation for the xHCI page size register that was previously missing. Before this change, the driver always hardcoded the page size to 4K (4096 bytes) regardless of what the hardware actually supported. 2. **Improves robustness, not fixing exploitable issue**: The new code: - Reads the actual page size supported by the xHCI hardware - Validates it's a power of 2 using `is_power_of_2(page_size)` - Falls back to 4K if invalid - Uses the validated value for DMA allocations 3. **No security boundary crossed**: The page_size is used for: - DMA pool creation boundaries/alignment - Scratchpad buffer allocations These are legitimate hardware configuration parameters, not security boundaries that could be exploited. 4. **Old behavior was conservative**: The previous code always used 4K pages, which is the minimum the xHCI spec requires. This was a safe default that wouldn't cause memory corruption or other security issues. 5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the first example commit which fixed a debug message calculation error and was marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both are correctness improvements rather than security fixes. The commit improves hardware compatibility and correctness but does not fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
f37f1748564ac ASoC: tas2764: Mark SW_RESET as volatile
- [sasha] Wait, I see I received the wrong content. Let me analyze the actual commit about ASoC: tas2764. Looking at the commit: **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning based on the code analysis: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This commit simply marks the SW_RESET register as volatile in the regmap configuration. This is a correctness fix for proper driver operation, not a security issue. 2. **Nature of the change**: The change adds `TAS2764_SW_RST` to the list of volatile registers because it's a self-clearing bit. When software writes to this register to reset the device, the hardware automatically clears it. Marking it as volatile ensures the driver always reads the actual hardware state rather than a cached value. 3. **No security impact**: - This doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure - It doesn't address any exploitable condition - It's purely about ensuring the driver correctly tracks the hardware state of a reset register 4. **Similar commits pattern**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they are all ASoC (ALSA System on Chip) audio codec driver fixes that received "CVE Status: NO". They fix various driver issues like: - Power control mask corrections - Register marking as volatile - Alignment fixes - Volume scale corrections - Clock mode settings 5. **Functional impact only**: The worst case scenario without this fix is that the driver might read a stale cached value of the reset register instead of the actual hardware state. This could cause incorrect driver behavior but poses no security risk. This is a routine driver maintenance fix that ensures proper hardware register handling, with no security implications.
4f79eaa2ceac8 kbuild: Properly disable -Wunterminated-string-initialization for clang
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Changes:** The commit only moves compiler warning flags between Makefiles to fix a build issue with clang's handling of `-Wunterminated-string-initialization`. The changes are purely about: 1. Moving `-Wextra` from line 49 to line 11 in `scripts/Makefile.extrawarn` 2. Moving `-Wstringop-overflow` and `-Wunterminated-string-initialization` handling from `Makefile` to `scripts/Makefile.extrawarn` **Why this is NOT a security issue:** 1. **No functional code changes**: This only reorganizes how compiler warning flags are ordered and structured 2. **Build system fix**: The issue is that clang and GCC handle warning flag precedence differently, causing build warnings/errors 3. **Same security posture**: The same warnings are still disabled - they're just moved to ensure proper ordering across compilers 4. **No vulnerability addressed**: No buffer overflows, memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security concerns are being fixed **Comparison to reference commits:** All the provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" are similar - they address compiler warnings, build issues, or code cleanup without fixing actual security vulnerabilities. This commit falls into the same category. The commit message explicitly states this is about "disabling warnings" and fixing "different behaviors" between compilers, not about addressing any security flaw in the kernel code itself.
ee7360fc27d60 drm/amdgpu: read back register after written for VCN v4.0.5
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit addresses a race condition in VCN (Video Core Next) v4.0.5 hardware where the WPTR (write pointer) is not properly updated after starting from idle when doorbell mechanism is used. The fix adds register read-back operations to ensure all register writes complete before proceeding. 2. **Type of issue**: This is a hardware timing/synchronization issue, not a security vulnerability. The fix adds memory barriers by reading back registers to ensure write ordering, which is a common hardware workaround pattern. 3. **Impact assessment**: The race condition would likely cause: - Video decoding/encoding malfunctions - Incorrect pointer states leading to functional failures - Potential hangs or crashes in video processing 4. **No security implications**: Looking at the code changes: - No memory corruption potential - No privilege escalation paths - No buffer overflow risks - No access control bypasses - This affects video hardware functionality, not security boundaries 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this is similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 2" which were both marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they dealt with hardware workarounds for AMD GPU components but were not security issues. The commit fixes a functional reliability issue in video hardware, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes.
732b87a409667 drm/i915/dp: Fix determining SST/MST mode during MTP TU state computation
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a bug in the Intel i915 display driver's DisplayPort MST (Multi-Stream Transport) configuration logic, but it does not represent a security vulnerability requiring a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit changes how the driver determines whether to use SST (Single Stream Transport) or MST mode during state computation. The key change is using `intel_crtc_has_type(crtc_state, INTEL_OUTPUT_DP_MST)` instead of `intel_dp->is_mst` to determine the mode. 2. **Impact**: This is a correctness fix for display configuration logic. The bug could cause incorrect bandwidth calculations and display configuration for DisplayPort connections, but it doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities like: - Memory corruption or buffer overflows - Privilege escalation opportunities - Information disclosure - Denial of service beyond normal display functionality 3. **Similar commit patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they are all display/graphics driver fixes marked with "CVE Status: NO". These involve similar display configuration and state management issues without security implications. 4. **Scope of impact**: The bug affects display functionality and could potentially cause display issues or incorrect mode setting, but it operates within the normal bounds of graphics driver functionality without crossing security boundaries. The fix addresses a functional bug in display driver logic rather than a security vulnerability, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
d5d45a7f26194 gcc-15: make 'unterminated string initialization' just a warning
- [sasha] Now let me look at the commit message again to understand what this commit is actually doing. Looking at the code changes and commit message: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: This commit only changes a compiler warning flag from an error to a warning. It adds `-Wno-error=unterminated-string-initialization` to downgrade the GCC 15 compiler warning from an error back to just a warning. 2. **Build system change only**: The change is purely in the Makefile build configuration - it doesn't fix any actual security issue in the kernel code itself. 3. **Context from similar commits**: All 5 similar reference commits (which have "CVE Status: NO") are also GCC 15 warning-related fixes that adjust code to satisfy compiler warnings about unterminated string initialization. These were all determined to not need CVEs because they were compiler compatibility fixes, not security fixes. 4. **Explicit explanation in commit message**: Linus clearly explains this is about a "misdesigned" warning from GCC that triggers on legitimate and correct C code patterns like `unsigned char hex[16] = "0123456789abcdef";` which is "a very traditional AND CORRECT way to initialize fixed byte arrays in C." 5. **No code behavior change**: This change doesn't alter any runtime behavior of the kernel - it only affects compilation with GCC 15. The change in `Makefile` at line 1061 simply adds a compiler flag to prevent build failures when using GCC 15, without changing any actual kernel functionality or fixing any security issues.
84b6f8503b29a drm/xe: Use xe_mmio_read32() to read mtcfg register
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
18311a766c587 err.h: move IOMEM_ERR_PTR() to err.h
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Pure Code Organization**: This is a straightforward code refactoring that moves the `IOMEM_ERR_PTR()` macro definition from `include/linux/io.h` to `include/linux/err.h`. The macro definition itself is completely unchanged: - Before: `#define IOMEM_ERR_PTR(err) (__force void __iomem *)ERR_PTR(err)` - After: `#define IOMEM_ERR_PTR(error) (__force void __iomem *)ERR_PTR(error)` 2. **No Functional Changes**: The commit only changes the location of the macro definition - it doesn't alter its behavior, fix any bugs, or address any security issues. All existing usages throughout the kernel will continue to work identically. 3. **Dependency Reduction Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is about reducing header dependencies ("helps avoid dependency on io.h for the users that don't need it"), which is a common kernel maintenance practice with no security implications. 4. **Pattern Recognition**: Looking at the similar commits provided as examples: - Similar commits 1, 2, and 5 are simple refactoring/organization changes marked as "NO" - Similar commits 3 and 4 are actual bug fixes (fixing double negation that could cause crashes) marked as "YES" 5. **No Security Context**: There are no mentions of fixes, vulnerabilities, security issues, or any problematic behavior being addressed. The macro simply casts an error pointer to an `__iomem` pointer type, which is a type system construct. This is clearly a maintenance/organization commit with zero security implications.
7aba292eb1538 spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Reset SR flags before sending a new message
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Security Impact**: This is a race condition vulnerability in SPI slave mode that can cause premature DMA callback execution, potentially leading to data corruption or information disclosure. **Key Issues**: 1. **Race Condition**: The commit message specifically describes a timing vulnerability: "If SR.RFDF (RX FIFO is not empty) remains asserted, the DMA callback will be fired before the controller sends any data." 2. **Data Corruption Risk**: When the controller sends more data than expected in a previous transfer, the SR.RFDF flag remains set. This causes the next transfer's DMA callback to trigger prematurely, before actual data arrives, potentially corrupting the receive buffer or exposing stale data. 3. **Target Mode Vulnerability**: The issue specifically affects SPI slave/target mode with DMA, where the device waits for external data. The premature callback execution could allow an attacker controlling the SPI master to manipulate timing and potentially: - Cause buffer corruption by triggering callbacks at unexpected times - Access stale data from previous transfers - Disrupt data integrity in security-sensitive SPI communications 4. **Similar CVE Pattern**: This matches the pattern of Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, and 5 which all received CVEs for SPI FIFO handling issues that could lead to data corruption or information disclosure. **Technical Fix**: The fix adds `regmap_write(dspi->regmap, SPI_SR, SPI_SR_CLEAR);` to clear all status register flags (including SR.RFDF) before each transfer, preventing the race condition. This represents a clear security vulnerability where improper hardware state management can lead to timing-based data corruption in SPI communications.
8a30a6d35a11f spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Halt the module after a new message transfer
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a hardware timing issue with chip select (PCS) signal deassertion at low speeds, but does not address a security vulnerability. Analysis: 1. **Nature of the issue**: The commit addresses a hardware timing problem where the PCS signal remains asserted even after EOQ indicates transmission end at speeds below ~200kHz. This affects proper device communication but is not a security issue. 2. **Code changes are for functionality, not security**: - Addition of `SPI_SR_TXRXS` bit definition for status checking - Adding halt/resume logic with proper status polling - No fixes for buffer overflows, access control, privilege escalation, or other security concerns 3. **Similar pattern in reference commits**: Looking at similar commits (like c5c31fb71f16), they address SCK timing glitches and other hardware protocol issues, but are marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are functional/correctness fixes rather than security fixes. 4. **Impact assessment**: While improper PCS signaling could potentially cause device malfunction or data corruption in some scenarios, this is a protocol compliance issue rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously. 5. **No security keywords**: The commit message and code changes contain no security-related terminology or implications of exploitable conditions. This is a hardware protocol compliance fix to ensure proper chip select timing, not a security vulnerability fix.
ecc9ab4e924b7 drm/amdgpu/vcn4.0.5: split code along instances
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Primary Purpose**: This is a code refactoring that splits the VCN (Video Core Next) start/stop functions to work on individual instances rather than iterating through all instances. The commit message explicitly states this is to "split the code on a per instance basis" to enable future per-instance functionality. 2. **No Security Vulnerability Being Fixed**: - The code changes show structural reorganization, not security fixes - Functions are being broken down from handling multiple instances in loops to handling single instances - No input validation fixes, bounds checking, or access control changes - No memory corruption, race condition, or privilege escalation fixes evident 3. **Architectural Improvement**: - The changes improve code organization and enable better per-instance control - This pattern is being applied across multiple VCN versions as part of a broader architectural improvement - The refactoring could have security-positive effects (better isolation, resource management) but doesn't fix a specific vulnerability 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: - This differs significantly from the CVE-worthy commits in the examples, which removed problematic IRQ handling code that was causing warnings - Unlike security fixes that remove dangerous code paths or fix specific bugs, this is adding structure and organization **Conclusion**: This is a code refactoring/architectural improvement that enhances maintainability and sets up for future per-instance features, not a security vulnerability fix requiring CVE assignment.
9d7a0577c9db3 gcc-15: disable '-Wunterminated-string-initialization' entirely for now
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Introduced**: The commit disables a compiler warning, it doesn't introduce any actual security vulnerability. The ACPI signature arrays are used correctly with `memcmp(table->signature, table_sigs[sig], 4)` which doesn't rely on null termination. 2. **ACPI Signatures Are Intentionally Non-Null-Terminated**: The ACPI specification defines table signatures as exactly 4-byte identifiers (like "BERT", "BGRT", etc.). These are meant to be byte arrays, not C strings, so the lack of null termination is by design. 3. **Compiler Warning Issue, Not Code Issue**: The commit addresses a problem with GCC-15's implementation of the `-Wunterminated-string-initialization` warning and the `__nonstring` attribute, not an actual security flaw in the kernel code. 4. **Similar Patterns in Reference Commits**: All the provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" involve compiler warning adjustments, GCC compatibility fixes, and build system changes - exactly like this commit. 5. **Code Remains Functionally Identical**: The actual runtime behavior of the code is unchanged. The ACPI signatures are still handled the same way with proper `memcmp()` operations. 6. **Temporary Workaround**: Linus explicitly states this is a temporary measure ("for now") due to GCC toolchain issues, not a permanent security-impacting change. The commit is a build system/toolchain compatibility fix, not a security fix or a change that introduces security vulnerabilities. It falls into the same category as the reference commits that were correctly marked as not requiring CVEs.

07e90048e356a Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Check function enabled before doing close
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a defensive programming fix that prevents `btmtksdio_close()` from being called twice by checking the `BTMTKSDIO_FUNC_ENABLED` flag before proceeding. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The code changes don't fix a security vulnerability. Instead, they prevent potential resource management issues or race conditions that could occur from double-close operations. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar commits marked "NO" typically involve defensive programming, resource management improvements, or operational fixes - The one commit marked "YES" involved a kernel oops due to uninitialized pointer access in an interrupt handler - a clear security issue 4. **Impact analysis**: While calling `btmtksdio_close()` twice might cause operational issues (like attempting to release already-released resources), this doesn't represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service attacks. 5. **Commit message context**: The commit message describes this as preventing `btmtksdio_close` from being "called twice" - this is a robustness fix, not a security fix. This is a quality/robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix.
0b6d58bc6ea85 Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Do close if SDIO card removed without close
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's what I found: **CVE Status: YES** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a significant security issue related to improper cleanup when an SDIO Bluetooth card is physically removed. The vulnerability occurs when: 1. **Race condition with workqueue and interrupts**: Before this fix, when an SDIO card was physically removed, `btmtksdio_remove()` would directly proceed to `hci_unregister_dev()` and `hci_free_dev()` without ensuring that: - Interrupts were properly disabled (`sdio_writel(bdev->func, C_INT_EN_CLR, MTK_REG_CHLPCR, NULL)`) - The IRQ handler was released (`sdio_release_irq(bdev->func)`) - The txrx workqueue was cancelled (`cancel_work_sync(&bdev->txrx_work)`) 2. **Use-after-free potential**: If the card is physically removed while the `txrx_work` is still running, the workqueue could continue to access freed memory structures, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. 3. **Interrupt handling after removal**: The txrx workqueue could still attempt to enable interrupts (`sdio_writel(bdev->func, C_INT_EN_SET, MTK_REG_CHLPCR, NULL)`) on hardware that has been physically removed, potentially causing system instability. The fix ensures that `btmtksdio_close()` is called before device removal if `BTMTKSDIO_FUNC_ENABLED` is set, which properly: - Disables interrupts - Releases the IRQ handler - Cancels the workqueue synchronously - Clears the enabled state flag This is similar to the CVE-worthy commits shown in the reference examples (Similar Commit 1 and 2) which also deal with race conditions and use-after-free scenarios in Bluetooth drivers during device removal.
8508427a6e21c platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix attribute name usage for non-compliant items
- [sasha] Let me analyze this commit based on the code changes and the security implications: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The bug affects the display name versus actual attribute name used for WMI calls, but both names come from the same source (BIOS-provided attribute names). The fix preserves the original attribute name for WMI communication while only modifying the display name for filesystem compatibility. 2. **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Bypass**: The issue does not allow bypassing authentication, accessing unauthorized BIOS settings, or escalating privileges. Users still need the same admin credentials to modify BIOS settings regardless of this bug. 3. **Functional Bug, Not Security Flaw**: This is a compatibility issue where certain BIOS attributes with filesystem-incompatible characters (like "Intel VT for Directed I/O (VT-d)" containing '/') would fail to work properly. The WMI calls would use the modified display name instead of the original attribute name, causing the BIOS to not recognize the setting. 4. **No Data Corruption or Information Disclosure**: The bug does not expose sensitive information, corrupt data, or allow unauthorized access to system resources. 5. **Similar Pattern in Historical Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits marked as "YES" for CVE typically involve reference leaks, password handling issues, or authentication bypass problems. This commit is more similar to the "NO" commits which involve naming conventions or functional improvements without security implications. The fix simply ensures that the original attribute name is preserved and used for WMI communication while the display name (with '/' replaced by '\') is used only for filesystem operations, maintaining proper functionality without any security impact.
fb881cd760453 nilfs2: fix deadlock warnings caused by lock dependency in init_nilfs()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: 1. **Root cause analysis**: The commit message explicitly states these are "false positives" - the deadlock warnings are triggered by the addition of new locking in commit c0e473a0d226, but no actual deadlock vulnerability exists. 2. **Context and timing**: The fix removes semaphore locking in `init_nilfs()` because it's called "in the early stage of the mount operation and the filesystem has not yet started." This indicates the warnings are about theoretical lock dependencies that cannot actually occur in practice. 3. **Code changes confirm it's a cleanup**: The commit simply removes `down_write(&nilfs->ns_sem)` and `up_write(&nilfs->ns_sem)` calls that are no longer needed. The commit message explains these locks were originally added for a race condition that no longer exists due to architectural changes (nilfs objects and super block structures becoming one-to-one). 4. **No actual security impact**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fix real deadlocks that could cause denial of service, this commit only addresses false positive warnings from lockdep without fixing an actual exploitable deadlock condition. 5. **Comparison with CVE-worthy examples**: The similar nilfs2 deadlock commits that received CVEs (like the `nilfs_count_free_blocks` fix) addressed real deadlock scenarios that could be triggered during normal filesystem operations, whereas this fix addresses warnings about theoretical dependencies that cannot manifest as actual deadlocks. This is a maintenance/cleanup commit that resolves false positive warnings rather than fixing a genuine security vulnerability.
ca57d1c56f401 octeontx2: hide unused label
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is purely a build-time warning fix with no security implications. **Analysis:** 1. **Build-time only fix**: The changes only add `#ifdef CONFIG_DCB` guards around unused labels to prevent compiler warnings when `CONFIG_DCB` is disabled. This affects compilation, not runtime behavior. 2. **No functional changes**: The code logic remains identical - the commit only ensures labels are conditionally compiled to match their usage patterns. 3. **No security impact**: Unlike the reference CVE commits that fix memory leaks, missing error checks, or resource cleanup issues, this commit addresses a simple compiler warning with no security consequences. 4. **Code hygiene improvement**: This is similar to reference "CVE Status: NO" commits that make minor corrections without security relevance. The commit message explicitly states it's fixing "build-time warning" and the code changes show only conditional compilation directives around existing labels. There are no memory safety issues, resource leaks, or other security-relevant problems being addressed.
abf078c0a3221 wifi: mac80211: restore monitor for outgoing frames
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the code changes, my assessment is: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit message explicitly states this code was "accidentally dropped during the cooked monitor removal" and needs to be restored. This indicates a functional regression, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Analysis**: The change adds back monitoring functionality for outgoing wireless frames by: - Checking if monitor interfaces exist (`local->tx_mntrs`) - Calling `ieee80211_tx_monitor()` to send frames to monitor interfaces - This is purely diagnostic/monitoring functionality 3. **Security Impact Assessment**: - This is not a direct security vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or data exposure issues - The missing functionality affects network monitoring tools and debugging capabilities, but doesn't create attack vectors 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they are all marked as "CVE Status: NO" and involve various mac80211 fixes, reversions, and functional improvements. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a functional restoration rather than a security fix. 5. **Impact Scope**: The missing monitor functionality primarily affects: - Network administrators using wireless monitoring tools - Security researchers analyzing 802.11 traffic - Debugging and compliance monitoring While this fix is important for network monitoring and security tools, it restores functionality rather than fixing a vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously. Therefore, it does not warrant CVE assignment.
f7a35a3c36d1e mm: vmalloc: actually use the in-place vrealloc region
- [sasha] Now I can clearly see the bug! In the broken version, when `size <= alloced_size` (meaning the request can be satisfied by the existing allocation), the code: 1. Updates the KASAN metadata 2. Zeroes memory if needed 3. Updates `vm->requested_size` 4. **BUT MISSING**: `return (void *)p;` Without the return statement, the function falls through to allocate a completely new vmalloc region, copy the data, and free the old region - which is a major performance regression and waste of resources, but **not a security vulnerability**. Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit fixes a performance regression, not a security vulnerability. The bug caused vrealloc() to fall through and unnecessarily allocate new memory regions even when the existing allocation was sufficient, but it did not create any security issues: 1. **No memory corruption**: The original data was correctly preserved through memcpy() 2. **No memory leaks**: The old region was properly freed with vfree() 3. **No access violations**: All memory operations were on valid, allocated regions 4. **No privilege issues**: No changes to access control or permissions The missing `return (void *)p;` statement on line 4116 only caused inefficient memory allocation patterns, not security vulnerabilities. While this is marked for stable backport due to the significant performance impact, it does not warrant a CVE assignment.
283ae0c65e9c5 spi: spi-fsl-dspi: restrict register range for regmap access
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The vulnerability requires access to debugfs (`/sys/kernel/debug/regmap/.../registers`), which: - Has restrictive permissions (0400 - read-only for root) - Requires debugfs to be mounted (typically only in development environments) - Is generally not available in production systems 2. **Impact is Limited to DoS**: The "synchronous external abort" results in a kernel crash/panic, which is a denial-of-service condition, not a privilege escalation or information disclosure vulnerability. 3. **Similar Patterns in Reference Commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 2 and 3 (both marked "CVE Status: NO") deal with comparable register access control issues without getting CVEs - This aligns with the pattern that register access control fixes, while important, typically don't warrant CVEs unless they enable privilege escalation 4. **Administrative/Debug Interface**: The affected functionality is part of the kernel's debugging infrastructure, not a normal operational interface that regular users or applications would access. 5. **Hardware-Specific and Architectural**: The abort occurs due to accessing reserved hardware registers, which is a platform-specific hardware behavior rather than a software logic vulnerability. While this is a legitimate bug that can cause system crashes when accessed via debugfs, it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment because it requires root privileges, affects only debug functionality, and has limited real-world exploitability.
70d1eb031a68c mm: vmalloc: only zero-init on vrealloc shrink
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Performance optimization, not security fix**: The commit removes an unnecessary zeroing operation in the `vrealloc()` growth path, specifically when expanding within already-allocated memory. The comment states: "No need to zero memory here, as unused memory will have already been zeroed at initial allocation time or during realloc shrink time." 2. **No change in security guarantees**: The change preserves all existing security properties: - When `init_on_alloc` is enabled, memory is still zeroed at initial allocation time - When shrinking allocations, memory is still zeroed if `want_init_on_free()` OR `want_init_on_alloc(flags)` is true - KASAN poisoning/unpoisoning remains intact 3. **Logical correctness**: The optimization is based on the fact that when growing an allocation within the same vmalloc area, the "new" memory was either: - Already zeroed during initial allocation (if `init_on_alloc` was set) - Previously zeroed during a shrink operation 4. **Similar pattern to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this follows the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a memory management optimization that doesn't introduce new attack vectors. 5. **Fixes tag indicates bug fix, not security**: The commit fixes a performance regression introduced by the referenced commit, not a security vulnerability. The removal of redundant zeroing does not create an information disclosure vulnerability because the memory being exposed was already supposed to be zero according to the allocation flags and previous operations.
0f518255bde88 mm: fix VM_UFFD_MINOR == VM_SHADOW_STACK on USERFAULTFD=y && ARM64_GCS=y
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Implications Analysis 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a VM flag bit collision bug where `VM_UFFD_MINOR` and `VM_SHADOW_STACK` both used bit 38 when both `CONFIG_ARM64_GCS=y` and `CONFIG_USERFAULTFD=y` are enabled. 2. **Theoretical vs. Practical Impact**: The commit author himself states: "I can't think of any attack where this would help (presumably, if an attacker tries to disable shadow stacks, they are trying to hijack control flow so can't arbitrarily call into userfaultfd yet anyway) but this still feels somewhat scary." 3. **Attack Vector Analysis**: - For an attacker to exploit this, they would need to control userfaultfd operations - If they can already control userfaultfd calls, they likely already have significant code execution capabilities - The collision might theoretically disable shadow stack protections, but this requires an attacker who already has substantial control 4. **Code Change**: The fix is simply moving `VM_UFFD_MINOR_BIT` from bit 38 to bit 41 to avoid the collision - this is a straightforward bit assignment fix. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar commits that received "CVE Status: NO" were mostly architectural fixes, reverts, or optimizations without clear security implications - The one "CVE Status: YES" example involved race conditions in stack overflow detection which had clearer attack scenarios 6. **Lack of Demonstrated Exploitation**: There's no evidence of actual exploitation scenarios, and the author explicitly states uncertainty about viable attacks. This appears to be a configuration-dependent bug fix that addresses a theoretical security concern rather than a demonstrable vulnerability with clear attack vectors.
e05741fb10c38 mm/page_alloc.c: avoid infinite retries caused by cpuset race
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the additional context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No Direct Security Impact**: The infinite retry loop described is a performance/availability issue, not a security vulnerability. While it can cause a denial of service condition, it: - Requires legitimate access to cpuset functionality - Does not allow privilege escalation - Does not expose sensitive information - Does not allow unauthorized access to memory 2. **Race Condition Nature**: The issue is a race condition between cpuset updates and memory allocation retry logic. The commit message clearly explains the technical details: - `ac->nodemask` changes due to concurrent cpuset operations - The `should_reclaim_retry()` function uses the updated nodemask - But `get_page_from_freelist()` still uses the old `ac->preferred_zoneref` - This mismatch can cause infinite retries under memory pressure 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The issue only affects: - Processes with `MPOL_BIND` memory policy - Multi-node NUMA systems - Scenarios with maximum memory pressure and swap enabled - Concurrent cpuset operations 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, those marked "CVE Status: YES" typically involve: - NULL pointer dereferences (Similar Commit 1 & 2) - Scheduler warnings that could indicate deeper issues (Similar Commit 5) While those marked "CVE Status: NO" involve: - Performance optimizations (Similar Commit 3 & 4) - Infinite loops without security implications 5. **Fix Implementation**: The fix simply moves existing race detection logic (`check_retry_cpuset`) to an earlier point in the retry loop to prevent the infinite condition. This is a straightforward bug fix without security implications. The commit addresses a functional correctness issue that can impact system performance/availability but does not create a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
7190b3c8bd2b0 mm: mmap: map MAP_STACK to VM_NOHUGEPAGE only if THP is enabled
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit does not deserve a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a configuration compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. The problem occurs when: - A kernel is compiled without `CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE` - The previous commit mapped `MAP_STACK` to `VM_NOHUGEPAGE` unconditionally - When CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is disabled, `hugepage_madvise()` returns `-EINVAL` for any `MADV_NOHUGEPAGE` call - CRIU (checkpoint/restore tool) fails because it can't restore VM flags that include the "nh" (no hugepage) flag 2. **No Security Impact**: The code changes show this is purely a functional/compatibility fix: - The fix adds `#ifdef CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE` around the MAP_STACK → VM_NOHUGEPAGE mapping - When THP is disabled, setting VM_NOHUGEPAGE is meaningless anyway (no security boundary crossed) - The original behavior was functionally broken but not dangerous 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this fits the same pattern as commits that are configuration fixes, renames, or compatibility improvements without security implications. 4. **Root Cause**: This fixes a logical inconsistency where VM_NOHUGEPAGE was being set even when hugepage support was completely disabled at compile time, causing userspace tools like CRIU to fail during restore operations. The commit addresses a build configuration compatibility issue that breaks legitimate userspace tools, but does not fix any security vulnerability or memory safety issue.
113ed54ad276c mm/hugetlb: fix kernel NULL pointer dereference when replacing free hugetlb folios
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the exact race condition. Let me also look at the crash details in the commit message to understand the security impact: Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, I can now provide my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a kernel NULL pointer dereference that causes a complete system crash. The crash trace shows: ``` BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028 RIP: 0010:alloc_and_dissolve_hugetlb_folio+0x1d/0x1f0 ``` 2. **Race Condition in Critical Memory Management**: The vulnerability exists in a race condition between `__update_and_free_hugetlb_folio()` and `replace_free_hugepage_folios()`: - CPU1 calls `__folio_clear_hugetlb(folio)` which clears the hugetlb flag - CPU2 concurrently calls `folio_hstate(folio)` which returns NULL because the flag was cleared - This NULL pointer is then dereferenced, causing the crash 3. **Triggered via Userspace**: The crash can be triggered through CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator) operations, which can be initiated from userspace through various interfaces. 4. **System Availability Impact**: This is a complete denial of service - the NULL pointer dereference causes a kernel panic that crashes the entire system. 5. **Matches CVE Pattern**: Similar to the reference commits showing NULL pointer dereferences (mt76, Bluetooth, hugetlbfs), this represents a clear security vulnerability where userspace-triggerable actions can cause kernel crashes. The fix adds proper locking around the `folio_test_hugetlb()` and `folio_hstate()` calls to prevent the race condition, ensuring that the hugetlb state cannot change between the test and the hstate retrieval.
06717a7b6c865 memcg: always call cond_resched() after fn()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Key Differences from CVE-worthy commits:** 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit improves an existing soft lockup fix (ade81479c7dd) but doesn't address a new security issue. The code changes move `cond_resched()` from being called every 1024 iterations to being called after every task iteration in `mem_cgroup_scan_tasks()`. 2. **No security impact**: While soft lockups can cause system availability issues, this specific change: - Only affects the scheduling granularity during OOM processing - Doesn't fix memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control issues - Doesn't prevent exploitation of security vulnerabilities 3. **Performance/reliability improvement**: The commit improves system responsiveness during OOM conditions but doesn't close security holes. The original lockup was already partially fixed by commit ade81479c7dd. 4. **Comparison with CVE YES examples**: All the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fix soft lockups that could potentially be exploited for denial of service attacks or cause system instability. However, this commit is merely refining an existing fix rather than addressing a new vulnerability. The code change is minimal and focused on scheduling optimization - removing the counter (`int i = 0`) and calling `cond_resched()` unconditionally after each `fn(task, arg)` call. This doesn't constitute a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
b6ea95a34cbd0 kasan: avoid sleepable page allocation from atomic context
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** This is a kernel stability bug, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a "sleeping function called from invalid context" bug in KASAN's vmalloc shadow memory allocation code. The crash occurs when `kasan_populate_vmalloc_pte()` tries to allocate pages while preemption is disabled in lazy MMU mode. **Code Changes Analysis:** The fix changes the allocation strategy from per-PTE single page allocation to bulk allocation before entering the atomic context: - Introduces `___alloc_pages_bulk()` and `___free_pages_bulk()` helper functions - Pre-allocates pages using `alloc_pages_bulk()` outside the atomic context - Modifies `kasan_populate_vmalloc_pte()` to use pre-allocated pages instead of calling `__get_free_page()` **Security Impact Assessment:** 1. **No memory corruption**: The bug causes kernel crashes due to scheduling violations, not memory safety issues 2. **No privilege escalation**: The crash occurs during legitimate kernel operations (thread creation via `alloc_thread_stack_node()`) 3. **Denial of service only**: While this could cause system instability, it's not exploitable for unauthorized access 4. **KASAN-specific**: Only affects systems with KASAN enabled (debug/development feature) **Comparison with Historical Examples:** Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: YES" involve actual security issues like use-after-free vulnerabilities or memory corruption. This commit is more similar to the sparc/mm fix (CVE Status: NO) which also addresses preemption/atomic context issues without security implications. The fix improves system stability by preventing kernel crashes but does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers.

97dfbbd135cb5 highmem: add folio_test_partial_kmap()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the similar commits provided as reference, here is my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because: 1. **It fixes a security-relevant memory safety issue**: The commit addresses incorrect memory mapping behavior in multiple critical memory manipulation functions (`memcpy_from_folio()`, `memcpy_to_folio()`, `folio_zero_tail()`, `folio_fill_tail()`, and `memcpy_from_file_folio()`). 2. **Pattern matches known CVE-worthy issues**: Looking at the similar commits provided, both Similar Commit 1 and 2 received CVE assignments for the exact same type of issue - the `iov_iter: fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() if KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP` problem. This commit extends the fix to additional functions that have the same vulnerability. 3. **Memory mapping boundary violations**: When `CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP` is enabled, the affected functions could access memory beyond intended boundaries. The functions were only checking `folio_test_highmem()` but should also account for the debug configuration that forces single-page mapping. 4. **Potential for memory corruption**: Without proper boundary checks, these functions could write or read beyond the intended memory regions, leading to: - Data corruption - Information disclosure - Potential kernel crashes or hangs (as seen in the referenced commit c749d9b7ebbc) 5. **Marked for stable backport**: The commit includes `Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>`, indicating the maintainers consider this a significant fix worthy of backporting to stable kernels. 6. **Affects core memory management**: The bug is in fundamental memory copying operations used throughout the kernel, making the potential impact broad. The fact that Hugh Dickins already identified and fixed this pattern in `copy_page_from_iter_atomic()` (which received CVEs based on the similar commits), and this commit extends that same fix to additional functions, strongly indicates this is a security issue requiring CVE assignment.
221fcbf775788 module: release codetag section when module load fails
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis, this commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: ## Analysis Summary **Nature of the Bug**: This is a memory management issue in module loading failure paths where codetag section memory is not properly cleaned up, potentially leading to page faults when stale pointers are accessed. **Key Factors Against CVE Assignment**: 1. **Requires Elevated Privileges**: Exploitation requires root access or `CAP_SYS_MODULE` capability to load kernel modules. This significantly limits the attack surface to already-privileged users. 2. **Feature-Specific**: The bug only affects systems with `CONFIG_MEM_ALLOC_PROFILING=y` enabled, which is a debugging/profiling feature, not core kernel functionality. 3. **Primarily Stability Issue**: The main impact is system crashes (denial of service) rather than privilege escalation or information disclosure. While serious for system reliability, this is more of a quality/stability issue than a security vulnerability. 4. **Complex Exploitation**: Successfully exploiting this requires: - Ability to load modules - Triggering specific module load failure conditions - Controlling memory layout to reuse addresses - Precise timing to achieve the vulnerable state 5. **Limited Security Impact**: Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) and 5 (CVE Status: YES) dealt with allocation tag accounting errors that could lead to warnings, but they were much simpler bugs - This commit fixes a more complex issue but with higher privilege requirements **Code Change Analysis**: The fix adds a single line `codetag_free_module_sections(mod);` in the `module_deallocate()` function to properly clean up codetag memory when module loading fails. This is a straightforward resource cleanup fix. **Conclusion**: While this bug can cause system instability and crashes, it requires significant privileges to exploit and primarily affects system availability rather than security boundaries. This appears to be a high-priority stability fix rather than a security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
12ca42c237756 alloc_tag: allocate percpu counters for module tags dynamically
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code changes, commit message, and historical context, I can now make a determination. **YES** This commit fixes a clear **Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability** with the following characteristics: **Vulnerability Analysis:** 1. **UAF Mechanism**: When a module is unloaded, `free_module()` calls `percpu_modfree(mod)` which frees the module's percpu memory. However, the module's allocation tags may still be in use (referenced by active allocations), but their `counters` field points to the freed percpu memory. 2. **Dangerous Access Pattern**: The vulnerable code in `alloc_tag_read()` and `alloc_tag_sub()` accesses `tag->counters` using `per_cpu_ptr()` and `this_cpu_sub()`. If a module is unloaded but its allocations are still active, this becomes a UAF when the memory tracking code tries to access the freed percpu counters. 3. **Security Impact**: - **Memory corruption**: Writing to freed percpu memory via `this_cpu_sub(tag->counters->bytes, bytes)` - **Information disclosure**: Reading from freed memory in `alloc_tag_read()` - **Potential privilege escalation**: If an attacker can control module loading/unloading and allocation patterns 4. **Fix Mechanism**: The fix allocates percpu counters dynamically with `alloc_percpu()` for module tags and properly manages their lifetime with `free_percpu()`, ensuring counters remain valid as long as any allocations reference them. 5. **Stable Tag**: The commit includes `Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>`, indicating the maintainers consider this a serious issue requiring backporting. This is a legitimate security vulnerability that could lead to memory corruption and potential privilege escalation, making it worthy of a CVE assignment.
7e7cb7a13c810 Revert "drm/amd: Keep display off while going into S4"
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a revert that fixes a hang condition but does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the issue**: The commit message clearly explains this is reverting commit 68bfdc8dc0a1a because it "leads to hangs because DRM clients such as the console can try to access registers and cause a hang." 2. **Code changes**: The revert removes a conditional check `if (adev->in_s4) return 0;` that was preventing display hardware initialization during S4 hibernation sequence. The original commit was trying to optimize the user experience by keeping displays off, but inadvertently created a hang condition. 3. **Security implications**: This is a system stability issue (hang/denial of service) rather than a security vulnerability. The hang occurs when DRM clients attempt to access registers that are not properly initialized due to the early return during S4 sequence. This is a functional bug that causes system instability, not a security flaw that could be exploited. 4. **Reference to similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" include display management fixes and reverts that address functional issues without security implications, which aligns with this commit. 5. **Impact**: While the hang could be considered a local denial of service, it's an unintentional side effect of a power management optimization, not an exploitable vulnerability. The issue manifests during normal hibernation operations when legitimate system components try to access hardware. The commit fixes a system hang during hibernation but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously.
e48f9d849bfde smb: client: Reset all search buffer pointers when releasing buffer
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and related code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Defensive Programming, Not a Vulnerability Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is "defensive programming to prevent potential issues with stale pointers" and that "the active UAF vulnerability is fixed by the previous patch" (commit a7a8fe56e932). 2. **The Real UAF Was Already Fixed**: The actual use-after-free vulnerability that caused the KASAN warning was fixed in the previous commit (a7a8fe56e932), which properly checked the return code before using the pointers. That commit addresses the root cause of the security issue. 3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The current commit only adds NULL assignments to prevent stale pointer references. These pointers (`srch_entries_start` and `last_entry`) point to the same buffer as `ntwrk_buf_start` which was already being nullified. The code paths that use these pointers already have proper checks in place after the previous fix. 4. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Looking at the usage patterns: - `srch_entries_start` is used in line 784 but with proper buffer validation - `last_entry` is checked for NULL before use in lines 748, 765, and other locations - The previous UAF fix ensures return codes are checked before pointer usage 5. **Similar Historical Context**: This appears to be a hardening/cleanup commit following a real security fix, similar to how many kernel patches add defensive measures after addressing the core vulnerability. The commit improves code robustness but does not fix an actual exploitable vulnerability on its own.
b04f0d89e880b arm64: dts: marvell: uDPU: define pinctrl state for alarm LEDs
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a device tree configuration issue where alarm LEDs stopped working due to incorrect pinctrl settings, but this is not a security vulnerability for several reasons: 1. **No security functionality affected**: The issue is with alarm LEDs on a network hardware board that stopped working due to a pinctrl configuration problem. These are status indicator LEDs, not security-critical components. 2. **No access control or privilege impact**: The fix involves moving pinctrl definitions from the SPI node to the LEDs node and changing the pin function from "spi" to "gpio" for the relevant pins. This doesn't affect any access controls, memory protections, or privilege boundaries. 3. **Hardware-specific functionality issue**: This is purely a device tree configuration bug specific to the uDPU board where pins 15-16 of the North Bridge GPIO controller were incorrectly configured, preventing LED control. 4. **Similar pattern in reference commits**: All the similar commits provided are marked "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar device tree fixes for pinctrl, LED configurations, and board-specific hardware issues. The code changes show this is a straightforward device tree fix that moves pinctrl state definitions to the correct node and sets the proper pin function, with no security implications.
4e89a4077490f platform/x86: dell-wmi-sysman: Avoid buffer overflow in current_password_store()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here's my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Clear buffer overflow vulnerability**: The vulnerable code has `if (buf[length-1] == '\n')` where if `length` is 0 (empty string), it accesses `buf[-1]`, which is a clear buffer underflow/out-of-bounds read. 2. **Security-sensitive context**: This function handles password storage for Dell system management, specifically for "Admin" and "System" passwords that control BIOS settings and system access. Buffer overflows in authentication-related code are particularly concerning from a security perspective. 3. **Matches similar CVE patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) involves buffer overflow protection in string parsing - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) involves buffer overflow checks in string operations - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) involves buffer overflow detection when copying strings - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: YES) involves stack access buffer overflow protection 4. **Potential for exploitation**: The out-of-bounds read could potentially leak sensitive memory contents or cause crashes. Given this is in a password handling function, memory disclosure could be particularly problematic. 5. **Stable backport tag**: The presence of `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org` indicates the maintainers consider this a significant security issue worthy of backporting to stable kernels. The fix adds a simple length check (`if (length && buf[length - 1] == '\n')`) to prevent the buffer underflow when an empty string is provided, which is a classic buffer overflow mitigation pattern seen in the other CVE-worthy commits.
a7a8fe56e932a smb: client: Fix use-after-free in cifs_fill_dirent
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Vulnerability Analysis **Type**: Use-after-free vulnerability in SMB client directory reading functionality **Key Security Issues**: 1. **Use-After-Free Pattern**: The code demonstrates a classic use-after-free vulnerability where: - Memory buffer is freed by one process via `cifs_small_buf_release()` - Another concurrent process continues to access freed pointers (`last_entry`, `srch_entries_start`) - This can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, or potential code execution 2. **Race Condition**: The vulnerability occurs due to improper ordering of error checking and pointer usage: ```c // VULNERABLE (before fix): rc = server->ops->query_dir_next(...); if (cfile->srch_inf.last_entry) // Uses potentially freed pointer cifs_save_resume_key(cfile->srch_inf.last_entry, cfile); if (rc) // Error check comes AFTER usage return -ENOENT; // FIXED (after): rc = server->ops->query_dir_next(...); if (rc) // Error check comes FIRST return -ENOENT; if (cfile->srch_inf.last_entry) // Safe pointer usage cifs_save_resume_key(cfile->srch_inf.last_entry, cfile); ``` 3. **Impact Assessment**: - **High Severity**: Use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, or privilege escalation - **Reproducible**: KASAN report shows this is triggerable with concurrent directory operations - **Network-related**: Affects SMB client code handling network responses 4. **CVE Precedent**: This follows the exact same pattern as the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES": - Similar UAF vulnerabilities in CIFS/SMB client code - Race conditions involving network buffer management - Memory safety issues with concurrent access patterns The commit message explicitly mentions "use-after-free" with KASAN detection, provides a reproducer, and includes `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`, indicating this is a serious security issue requiring backporting to stable kernels.
cf948c8e274e8 thermal: intel: x86_pkg_temp_thermal: Fix bogus trip temperature
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a unit conversion bug where `tj_max` was being used in Celsius instead of milli-Celsius, but this is not a security vulnerability. Here's why: **Analysis of the fix:** The code change adds `tj_max *= 1000;` to convert from Celsius to milli-Celsius units. The bug was introduced during a merge commit (8ef0ca4a177d) where the thermal subsystem was refactored and the unit conversion was accidentally omitted in the `pkg_temp_thermal_device_add()` function, even though it was correctly handled in other functions like `sys_set_trip_temp()`. **Impact assessment:** 1. **Functional bug, not security issue**: This causes incorrect trip temperature calculations (off by a factor of 1000), leading to thermal management problems, but doesn't create security vulnerabilities. 2. **Similar to reference commit 1**: This resembles "Similar Commit 1" which was marked [CVE Status: NO] - both are thermal subsystem unit conversion/calculation fixes without security implications. 3. **No privilege escalation or memory safety issues**: The bug affects thermal trip point calculations but doesn't involve: - Buffer overflows - Memory corruption - Access control bypasses - Information disclosure - Privilege escalation 4. **Operational impact only**: Wrong trip temperatures could cause thermal throttling to occur at incorrect thresholds, potentially affecting system performance or causing unexpected shutdowns, but this is a reliability/functionality issue rather than a security concern. The commit fixes incorrect thermal trip temperature calculations in Intel x86 package temperature thermal driver, but the impact is limited to thermal management functionality without security implications.
0f5757667ec0a pmdomain: core: Fix error checking in genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_id()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a type comparison bug but does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Impact**: The bug involves incorrect error handling in `genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_id()` where negative error codes from `of_count_phandle_with_args()` were incorrectly treated as valid due to unsigned comparison with `index` (u32). However, this leads to a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Limited Consequences**: When the comparison fails due to the type promotion issue, the function would proceed with invalid values, but it would fail safely later in the execution path when trying to actually attach to a non-existent PM domain. The code doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. 3. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Comparing with the provided examples, this follows the pattern of Similar Commit 1 and 3 (both marked "CVE Status: NO") which are correctness fixes for resource management and error handling without security implications. The commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (Similar Commits 2 and 4) involve null pointer dereference vulnerabilities that could cause crashes. 4. **Infrastructure Context**: The PM domain subsystem handles power management for devices. The bug affects device initialization/attachment logic but doesn't expose system resources or create exploitable conditions. The fix is a straightforward type comparison correction (`if (index >= num_domains)` → `if (num_domains < 0 || index >= num_domains)`) to properly handle error conditions, making it a quality/reliability improvement rather than a security fix.
6692dbc15e5ed drm/edid: fixed the bug that hdr metadata was not reset
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of this commit and the surrounding code context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is an information persistence bug, not a security vulnerability. When a user disconnects a display with HDR capabilities and connects a non-HDR display, the old HDR metadata persists in the `hdr_sink_metadata` structure instead of being cleared. 2. **No Information Disclosure**: The HDR metadata contains display capability information like: - EOTF (Electro-Optical Transfer Function) values - Metadata type flags - Max/Min Content Light Level values This is technical display information, not sensitive data that could be exploited for security purposes. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The fix simply adds `memset(&connector->hdr_sink_metadata, 0, sizeof(connector->hdr_sink_metadata));` to the reset function. This is a data consistency fix, not a memory safety fix like the CVE-worthy examples provided. 4. **Limited Impact**: The stale HDR metadata could potentially cause incorrect display behavior or confusion about display capabilities, but this is a functional issue rather than a security issue. 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: The reference commits that received CVEs were fixing actual memory leaks (failing to `kfree()` allocated memory) or information leaks (uninitialized data exposure). This commit is fixing data persistence/consistency, which is fundamentally different. The commit correctly includes `Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>` because it fixes a functional bug that should be backported, but the issue lacks the security implications necessary for CVE assignment.
13a6d42656652 pmdomain: renesas: rcar: Remove obsolete nullify checks
- [sasha] **NO** This commit removes obsolete null checks that are no longer needed after the `rcar_sysc_nullify()` helper function was removed in a previous commit. The code changes simply remove defensive checks for `!area->name` that were preventing null pointer dereferences when domains could be "nullified" (set to NULL). Since the nullify functionality was completely removed, these checks became dead code. This is a cleanup commit that: 1. **Removes dead code** - The nullify checks are no longer functional since the nullify helper was removed 2. **No security impact** - The code now directly accesses `area->name` with `strlen()` and `memcpy()`, but since nullification is no longer possible, `area->name` should always be valid 3. **Fixes technical debt** - This addresses the gap left by the previous commit that removed the nullify helper but left the checks The commit is similar to the other "NO" CVE status commits in the reference set - it's a straightforward cleanup/refactoring without security implications. The removed checks were defensive programming that became obsolete after architectural changes.
71c9475b1e2cc mmc: sdhci_am654: Add SDHCI_QUIRK2_SUPPRESS_V1P8_ENA quirk to am62 compatible
- [sasha] ## CVE Decision **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Hardware compatibility fix, not security vulnerability**: The commit adds a device-specific quirk to fix MMC initialization failures on AM62 boards. This is purely a hardware compatibility issue, not a security flaw. 2. **Functional failure, not security impact**: MMC initialization failures prevent device functionality but do not create security vulnerabilities such as memory corruption, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data exposure. 3. **Consistent with similar commits**: All provided similar commits (hardware quirks, voltage switching fixes, LED configurations) were marked as NO for CVE, and this follows the same pattern. 4. **No exploitable security condition**: The code changes involve voltage signaling timing adjustments - there's no indication this creates any exploitable security condition or attack vector. 5. **Targeted hardware-specific fix**: This is a precise fix for a known hardware compatibility issue on a specific platform (AM62), not addressing any security vulnerability. The commit is a legitimate hardware support fix that restores proper MMC functionality on affected devices without introducing or fixing any security vulnerabilities.
3a08988123c86 io_uring/net: only retry recv bundle for a full transfer
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and kernel context, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a data integrity bug rather than a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: The issue is with io_uring recv bundles where partial transfers could create "gaps in the received data." The bug occurs when: - A shorter transfer than expected is received - The bundle retry logic would continue filling more data into the bundle - This creates discontinuous/gapped data in the received buffer 2. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds two key checks: - `!iov_iter_count(&kmsg->msg.msg_iter)` - ensures the iterator is fully consumed before retrying - `size_t this_ret = *ret - sr->done_io` - correctly calculates only the current transfer size for buffer accounting 3. **Impact Assessment**: - This is a **data integrity** issue, not a security vulnerability - The bug causes **data corruption/gaps** in received network data - No evidence of **memory corruption**, **privilege escalation**, or **information disclosure** - The corruption affects the application's own data stream, not other processes 4. **Similar Historical Commits**: All the similar io_uring/net bundle-related commits shown in the reference examples were marked as "CVE Status: NO," indicating this class of bugs typically doesn't warrant CVE assignment. 5. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The issue is contained within the application's own network receive buffer handling and doesn't cross security boundaries. While this is certainly a serious correctness bug that could cause application failures, it falls into the category of functional bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
43f0999af011f vmxnet3: update MTU after device quiesce
- [sasha] Now let me examine the race condition described in the commit and understand its potential security implications. **NO** This commit fixes a race condition in the vmxnet3 driver's MTU change handling, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a timing issue where the OS network stack could start using a new MTU before the VMware ESXi hypervisor is informed of the change. This is a synchronization problem between guest and host, not a security flaw. 2. **Impact Analysis**: - The issue affects TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) packets that use MSS (Maximum Segment Size) based on the new MTU - This could lead to packet processing errors or performance issues, but does not create exploitable security conditions - The race window is brief and occurs only during MTU changes 3. **Code Changes**: The fix simply reorders when `netdev->mtu` is updated - moving it from before device quiesce to after device quiesce and RX queue destruction. This ensures proper sequencing but doesn't address any memory safety issues, privilege escalation, or information disclosure vulnerabilities. 4. **Similar Commit Pattern**: Looking at the historical similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", they involve configuration and hardware setup changes that, while important for correctness, don't pose security risks. 5. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The issue is contained within normal network device configuration operations and doesn't affect security boundaries between guest/host or user/kernel spaces. This is a bug fix for proper device state management rather than a security vulnerability.
239af1970bcb0 llc: fix data loss when reading from a socket in llc_ui_recvmsg()
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes directly. Looking at the diff: ```diff /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var For non stream protcols we get one packet per recvmsg call bippy/ cve_classifier/ cve_utils/ dyad/ explain/ model/ prompt/ target/ verhaal/ verhaal_rs/ voting_results/ if (sk->sk_type != SOCK_STREAM) goto copy_uaddr; + /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var Partial read bippy/ cve_classifier/ cve_utils/ dyad/ explain/ model/ prompt/ target/ verhaal/ verhaal_rs/ voting_results/ + if (used + offset < skb_len) + continue; + if (!(flags & MSG_PEEK)) { skb_unlink(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue); kfree_skb(skb); *seq = 0; } - - /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var Partial read bippy/ cve_classifier/ cve_utils/ dyad/ explain/ model/ prompt/ target/ verhaal/ verhaal_rs/ voting_results/ - if (used + offset < skb_len) - continue; ``` **Analysis:** This commit fixes a data loss bug in the LLC socket implementation. The issue occurs when: 1. A SOCK_STREAM socket receives data 2. The user buffer size (len) is smaller than the socket buffer size (skb->len) 3. Only part of the data is read (partial read scenario) **The Problem:** Before the fix, the code would: 1. Copy partial data to user buffer 2. Free the entire skb (losing remaining data) 3. Then check if it was a partial read (too late!) **The Fix:** After the fix, the code: 1. Copies partial data to user buffer 2. Checks if it was a partial read BEFORE freeing the skb 3. If partial read, continues the loop (preserving the skb) 4. Only frees the skb when all data has been consumed **Security Impact:** This is a **data loss/corruption** issue, not a security vulnerability. The bug causes legitimate data to be lost, but it doesn't: - Allow unauthorized access to memory - Cause buffer overflows - Enable privilege escalation - Lead to information disclosure - Create exploitable conditions Comparing to the similar commits: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Data error in MSG_PEEK - functional bug, not security - Similar Commit 2 (YES CVE): Buffer underflow leading to kernel panic - security issue - Similar Commit 3 (YES CVE): Memory contents leak - information disclosure - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Improved input handling - code improvement - Similar Commit 5 (YES CVE): Memory leak - resource exhaustion issue **CVE Status: NO** This is a functional data loss bug that affects application correctness but does not create security vulnerabilities. It's similar to Similar Commit 1 which also had "NO" CVE status for a data handling issue in socket receive operations.
6d820b81c4dc4 can: kvaser_pciefd: Continue parsing DMA buf after dropped RX
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit carefully: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes a logical error in packet processing, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when `netif_rx()` returns non-zero (indicating a dropped packet), the driver incorrectly treated this as a fatal error and stopped processing the remaining DMA buffer. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - Changes return values from `-ENOMEM` to `0` in `kvaser_pciefd_handle_data_packet()` when `alloc_canfd_skb()` or `alloc_can_skb()` fail - Changes `return netif_rx(skb);` to `netif_rx(skb); return 0;` to ignore the return value of `netif_rx()` - The key insight is that `netif_rx()` returning non-zero is not an error condition that should halt processing - it just means the packet was dropped due to congestion 3. **Impact assessment**: This is a robustness/reliability fix, not a security fix. The issue causes: - Premature termination of DMA buffer processing when packets are dropped - Loss of subsequent valid packets in the buffer - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security implications 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar code improvements/cleanups, while the one marked "CVE Status: YES" (hi3110_can_ist) fixed an actual use-after-free vulnerability. This commit is more like the "NO" examples - it's a logical fix for proper operation, not a security vulnerability. The commit improves driver resilience but does not fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
ba54bce747fa9 net: dsa: microchip: linearize skb for tail-tagging switches
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a security vulnerability involving uninitialized memory access in network packet processing. **Key Security Issues:** 1. **Uninitialized Memory Read**: The code performs pointer arithmetic `skb_tail_pointer(skb) - KSZ_EGRESS_TAG_LEN` on nonlinear skbs, which reads uninitialized memory from the skb headroom instead of the actual packet tag data. 2. **Information Disclosure Potential**: The uninitialized headroom memory could contain remnants of previous packet headers, driver metadata, or other kernel memory contents that should not be accessible. 3. **Network Attack Vector**: An attacker can craft packets that trigger nonlinear skb handling to cause this uninitialized memory read, making it network-exploitable. 4. **CVE Precedent**: Similar uninitialized memory reads in network code have consistently received CVE assignments (e.g., CVE-2021-47136, CVE-2024-26633). 5. **Long-standing Vulnerability**: The affected code has been in production for 6-8 years (KSZ9477 since 2017, KSZ8795 since 2019). 6. **Stable Backport**: The commit includes "CC: stable@vger.kernel.org", indicating the kernel security team considers this a security issue warranting stable tree inclusion. While the practical exploitability is limited (requires specific Microchip KSZ switch hardware and mainly causes functional issues), the fundamental security pattern of reading uninitialized kernel memory in network packet processing is exactly the type of issue that warrants CVE assignment based on established precedent.
8d70503068510 ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14ASP10
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is a simple hardware compatibility fix that adds a PCI quirk entry for a specific Lenovo laptop model (Yoga Pro 7 14ASP10) to enable bass speaker functionality. 2. **Code Analysis**: The commit adds a single line: ```c SND_PCI_QUIRK(0x17aa, 0x390d, "Lenovo Yoga Pro 7 14ASP10", ALC287_FIXUP_YOGA9_14IAP7_BASS_SPK_PIN) ``` This maps a PCI subsystem ID to an existing audio fixup function. 3. **Function Purpose**: The `alc287_fixup_yoga9_14iap7_bass_spk_pin` function corrects pin configuration for bass speakers that are "wrongly reported as unconnected" and ensures proper DAC routing for audio output. 4. **No Security Implications**: - The fixup only changes audio pin configurations and DAC routing - It corrects a hardware reporting issue, not a security vulnerability - No memory management, access control, or privilege changes involved - No input validation or boundary checking issues addressed 5. **Historical Context**: All similar commits in the provided examples (quirks for other Lenovo models like Yoga Pro 7 14AHP9, Thinkbook 16P Gen 5, Lenovo 13X, Y990 laptop, and Yoga 9 14IMH9) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", establishing a clear pattern that audio hardware compatibility fixes do not warrant CVE assignment. This is purely a hardware enablement patch with no security relevance.
93a81ca065775 ALSA: pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer
- [sasha] Let me analyze what we have based on the commit message and code changes. Now I have enough information to make an assessment. **Analysis:** This commit fixes a **Use-After-Free (UAF)** vulnerability in the ALSA PCM OSS layer. Here's the security analysis: **Key Security Issues Fixed:** 1. **Race Condition Leading to UAF**: The commit message explicitly states "this may lead to a UAF because the accessed runtime->dma_area might be freed concurrently" 2. **Concurrent Access Problem**: The OSS layer was accessing `runtime->dma_area` outside of proper locking mechanisms, making it vulnerable to concurrent modifications/frees 3. **Buffer Access Without Protection**: The original code called `snd_pcm_format_set_silence()` directly on `runtime->dma_area` without ensuring the buffer wouldn't be freed during the operation **Security Impact:** - **Use-After-Free**: Can lead to memory corruption, potential code execution, or system crashes - **Race condition**: Multiple threads could access/modify the same memory region simultaneously - **Memory safety violation**: Accessing freed memory can cause unpredictable behavior **How the Fix Works:** 1. **New Protected Function**: Created `snd_pcm_runtime_buffer_set_silence()` that uses the existing buffer access locking mechanism 2. **Proper Locking**: Uses `snd_pcm_buffer_access_lock()` and `snd_pcm_buffer_access_unlock()` to ensure exclusive access 3. **Atomic Protection**: The buffer access locking uses atomic operations to prevent concurrent access during buffer operations **Comparison to Similar Commits:** This is very similar to the earlier commits in the reference examples that also deal with race conditions and UAF issues in ALSA PCM code. Like similar commits 1-3 which were marked "CVE Status: YES", this commit: - Fixes a race condition in ALSA PCM - Prevents UAF vulnerabilities - Was reported by syzbot (indicating it's a real security issue) - Includes "Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>" marking it for stable backports **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. It fixes a clear Use-After-Free vulnerability caused by a race condition in the ALSA PCM OSS layer. The commit message explicitly mentions UAF, it was reported by syzbot, includes stable backport tags, and follows the same pattern as similar ALSA PCM race condition fixes that have been assigned CVEs. The code changes show proper implementation of buffer access protection to prevent concurrent access to potentially freed memory regions.
98db16f314b3a ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Delay reporting is only supported for playback direction
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** This is a functional correctness fix for audio delay reporting, not a security vulnerability. The commit prevents invalid delay values from being reported to userspace for capture streams. **Code Analysis:** The change is minimal and defensive - it adds an additional condition `|| stream == SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_CAPTURE` to skip allocating timestamp info for capture streams. This prevents the driver from attempting to calculate delay for capture streams where the firmware doesn't provide the necessary information. **Security Assessment:** 1. **No memory safety issues**: The change prevents allocation rather than causing memory corruption 2. **No privilege escalation**: This affects audio delay reporting, not access controls 3. **No information disclosure**: The fix prevents invalid data from being sent to userspace, improving correctness 4. **No denial of service**: The change improves robustness by preventing invalid operations **Comparison with Similar Commits:** All the provided similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar audio functionality improvements and bug fixes in the same subsystem. This commit follows the same pattern of being a correctness fix rather than a security issue. **Impact:** The bug would cause incorrect delay values to be reported for audio capture streams, which is a functional issue affecting audio applications but poses no security risk. This is a straightforward bug fix for audio functionality with no security implications.
6052f05254b4f ASoc: SOF: topology: connect DAI to a single DAI link
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **What the commit fixes:** The commit addresses a logic bug in DAI (Digital Audio Interface) widget to DAI link matching within the SOF (Sound Open Firmware) topology subsystem. The issue was that partial string matching could incorrectly connect widgets when one widget name was a substring of another (e.g., "Foo1" vs "Foo10"). **Why this is not a security vulnerability:** 1. **Functional bug, not security flaw**: This is a topology configuration/matching logic error that affects audio functionality, not system security. The bug causes incorrect DAI widget connections but doesn't expose memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities. 2. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects audio topology configuration within the SOF subsystem - it's a driver-level configuration matching problem that would manifest as audio functionality issues, not security exploits. 3. **No security impact patterns**: The code changes show: - Addition of prioritization logic for exact vs partial matches - No buffer overflow fixes - No access control changes - No input validation for untrusted data - No memory safety improvements 4. **Similar pattern from examples**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: YES" involve NULL pointer dereference fixes that could cause crashes/DoS. Those marked "CVE Status: NO" involve resource leaks and functional configuration issues similar to this commit. The commit fixes a configuration matching bug that affects audio functionality but poses no security threat to the system.
8256e0ca60105 can: kvaser_pciefd: Fix echo_skb race
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a race condition that can lead to memory corruption and system instability. **Analysis:** 1. **Race Condition Details**: The commit fixes a race between `kvaser_pciefd_start_xmit()` and `kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet()` where both functions compete to access the `echo_skb` array without proper synchronization. The error "can_put_echo_skb: BUG! echo_skb 5 is occupied!" indicates two threads tried to use the same index simultaneously. 2. **Security Implications**: - **Memory corruption potential**: The race can lead to use-after-free or double-free conditions in the `echo_skb` array - **System stability**: Can cause kernel crashes and denial of service - **Resource exhaustion**: Memory leaks from lost skb references 3. **Critical Infrastructure Impact**: CAN drivers are used in automotive and industrial control systems where reliability is safety-critical. 4. **CVE Precedent**: Similar CAN driver race conditions have received CVEs (e.g., CVE-2023-52878 for `can_priv::echo_skb` access issues). 5. **Code Changes Show Serious Fix**: The commit replaces inadequate locking (`echo_lock` only used in TX path) with proper lock-free synchronization using memory barriers (`smp_store_release()`) and sequential index checking, indicating the original bug was substantial. The race condition represents a significant vulnerability that could be exploited to cause system crashes or potentially memory corruption in safety-critical systems, warranting CVE assignment.
4d14b1069e9e6 ASoC: SOF: ipc4-control: Use SOF_CTRL_CMD_BINARY as numid for bytes_ext
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes an information disclosure issue but is not severe enough to warrant a CVE assignment. Here's the analysis: **The Issue:** The original code was exposing a kernel internal identifier (`scontrol->comp_id`) to userspace through the `header.numid` field in the `_sof_ipc4_bytes_ext_get()` function. The commit message explicitly states "The use of comp_id is not quite great as it is kernel internal identification number." **The Fix:** The commit adds proper validation and uses a standardized constant (`SOF_CTRL_CMD_BINARY`) instead: 1. **In bytes_ext_put()**: Added validation to check `header.numid != SOF_CTRL_CMD_BINARY` 2. **In bytes_ext_get()**: Changed `header.numid = scontrol->comp_id` to `header.numid = SOF_CTRL_CMD_BINARY` **Security Assessment:** While this is technically an information disclosure vulnerability (exposing kernel internal data), it has very limited security impact: - The exposed data is just a component ID number, not sensitive memory contents - It doesn't enable privilege escalation, memory corruption, or system compromise - The exposure is limited to users with access to SOF audio controls - This is more of a design/API consistency issue than a critical security flaw **Reference Analysis:** All provided similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar SOF control handling improvements, structural changes, and API consistency fixes without security implications. This fix improves API consistency and prevents leakage of kernel internals, but the low severity and limited impact don't meet the threshold for CVE assignment.
4e7010826e967 ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-bus: Use PIO mode on ACE2+ platforms
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel codebase, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Bug Fix Nature**: This is a hardware compatibility fix that extends an existing feature (PIO mode) from ACE 2.0 (Lunar Lake) to all ACE 2.0+ platforms (Lunar Lake, Panther Lake, etc.). The original commit restricted PIO mode to only `== SOF_INTEL_ACE_2_0`, but Intel recommends using PIO mode for all ACE 2.0+ platforms. 2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change involves switching from CORB/RIRB (Command Output Ring Buffer/Response Input Ring Buffer) to PIO (Programmed I/O) mode for HDA bus commands on newer Intel audio DSP platforms. This is a hardware communication mechanism choice, not a security fix. 3. **Performance/Reliability Issue**: Both PIO and CORB/RIRB are valid methods for sending commands to the audio codec. The change ensures that newer Intel platforms use the hardware-recommended communication method, which is a reliability and performance improvement rather than a security fix. 4. **Similar Pattern**: The similar commits in the reference show hardware compatibility and configuration changes that were not assigned CVEs, and this follows the same pattern - a hardware-specific configuration adjustment without security implications. 5. **No Attack Vector**: There's no indication that the wrong communication mode creates any exploitable security vulnerability, privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant issues. The commit is tagged for stable backporting (`Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`) because it fixes platform compatibility issues, not security vulnerabilities.
dac5e6249159a can: bcm: add missing rcu read protection for procfs content
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security analysis: **Security Vulnerability Type**: Use-After-Free (UAF) in procfs content generation **Analysis of the Issue**: 1. **Root Cause**: The commit message explicitly states "When the procfs content is generated for a bcm_op which is in the process to be removed the procfs output might show unreliable data (UAF)." 2. **Technical Details**: - The original commit f1b4e32aca08 introduced RCU-based asynchronous cleanup of `bcm_op` structures via `call_rcu()` - However, the `bcm_proc_show()` function was not updated to use proper RCU read protection - This created a race condition where procfs could access `bcm_op` structures while they were being freed via RCU 3. **Code Evidence**: - The fix adds `rcu_read_lock()` and `rcu_read_unlock()` around list traversal in `bcm_proc_show()` - Changes `list_for_each_entry()` to `list_for_each_entry_rcu()` for proper RCU traversal - Updates `list_del()` to `list_del_rcu()` in deletion functions to ensure RCU-safe removal 4. **Security Impact**: - **Use-After-Free vulnerability**: Reading freed memory can lead to information disclosure or potential code execution - **Info leak potential**: "unreliable data" suggests freed memory contents could be exposed via procfs - **Procfs accessibility**: Since this affects procfs, it's accessible to unprivileged users who can read the CAN BCM proc entries 5. **CVE Precedent**: This matches Similar Commit 1 which was assigned a CVE for a UAF in `bcm_proc_show()`, establishing precedent for BCM procfs UAF vulnerabilities getting CVEs. 6. **Scope**: Affects kernel versions >= 5.4 (marked for stable backport), indicating this is a long-standing vulnerability with wide impact. The vulnerability represents a classic race condition leading to use-after-free, with potential for information disclosure through procfs access.
c2aba69d0c36a can: bcm: add locking for bcm_op runtime updates
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the vulnerability clearly. Let me analyze the race condition scenario: **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. ## Analysis This commit fixes a **race condition vulnerability** that can lead to a **KASAN slab-out-of-bounds read access**. Here's the specific security issue: ### The Vulnerability: 1. **Race Condition Location**: The race occurs between: - **User context**: `bcm_tx_setup()` can modify `op->nframes` from userspace via socket operations - **Timer context**: `bcm_can_tx()` accesses `op->frames + op->cfsiz Cargo.lock Cargo.toml bippy btrfs_scrub_null_deref_analysis.md cve_classifier cve_utils dpu_clones_analysis.md drm_dp_no_zero_sized_analysis.md dyad explain fineibt_rust_security_analysis.md hrtimer_switch_case_analysis.md lan743x_sgmii_analysis.md log.txt model padata_refcount_leak_analysis.md prompt rxe_cq_analysis_prompt.txt rxe_cq_race_analysis.md target tsnep_timestamp_analysis.md ublk_deadlock_analysis.md unaccepted_memory_race_analysis.md verhaal verhaal_rs voting_results xe_vf_security_analysis.md op->currframe` via hrtimer 2. **Vulnerable Code Path** (before the fix): ```c // In bcm_can_tx() - called from hrtimer context struct canfd_frame *cf = op->frames + op->cfsiz Cargo.lock Cargo.toml bippy btrfs_scrub_null_deref_analysis.md cve_classifier cve_utils dpu_clones_analysis.md drm_dp_no_zero_sized_analysis.md dyad explain fineibt_rust_security_analysis.md hrtimer_switch_case_analysis.md lan743x_sgmii_analysis.md log.txt model padata_refcount_leak_analysis.md prompt rxe_cq_analysis_prompt.txt rxe_cq_race_analysis.md target tsnep_timestamp_analysis.md ublk_deadlock_analysis.md unaccepted_memory_race_analysis.md verhaal verhaal_rs voting_results xe_vf_security_analysis.md op->currframe; // Later in the same function: op->currframe++; if (op->currframe >= op->nframes) op->currframe = 0; ``` 3. **Attack Scenario**: - Attacker sets up a BCM operation with `nframes = N` (allocates array for N frames) - Timer starts executing `bcm_can_tx()` with `currframe` pointing to a valid index - **Concurrently**, attacker calls `bcm_tx_setup()` and reduces `nframes` to a smaller value (e.g., 1) - The old `currframe` value now points **beyond the valid array bounds** - Next access to `op->frames + op->cfsiz Cargo.lock Cargo.toml bippy btrfs_scrub_null_deref_analysis.md cve_classifier cve_utils dpu_clones_analysis.md drm_dp_no_zero_sized_analysis.md dyad explain fineibt_rust_security_analysis.md hrtimer_switch_case_analysis.md lan743x_sgmii_analysis.md log.txt model padata_refcount_leak_analysis.md prompt rxe_cq_analysis_prompt.txt rxe_cq_race_analysis.md target tsnep_timestamp_analysis.md ublk_deadlock_analysis.md unaccepted_memory_race_analysis.md verhaal verhaal_rs voting_results xe_vf_security_analysis.md op->currframe` causes **slab-out-of-bounds read** 4. **Security Impact**: - **Information disclosure**: Out-of-bounds read can leak kernel memory contents - **Potential memory corruption**: Depending on timing, could lead to further exploitation - **KASAN detection**: Shows this triggers memory safety violations ### The Fix: The commit adds `spinlock_t bcm_tx_lock` to protect concurrent access to: - `op->currframe` (the frame index) - `op->count` (also raceable) - `op->nframes` (when modified in `bcm_tx_setup`) This follows the **security-critical pattern**: when user-controlled data races with kernel timer contexts, it typically indicates a security vulnerability that can be exploited for memory corruption or information disclosure. The fact that this was **reported by a security researcher** (Anderson Nascimento) with a **proof of concept** that triggered KASAN strongly indicates this is a genuine security issue requiring CVE assignment.
0eefa27b49330 octeontx2-af: Set LMT_ENA bit for APR table entries
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not appear to be a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## What the commit does: 1. **Enables LMT functionality**: The commit sets the `LMT_ENA` bit (bit 20) in the APR LMT map table entries to enable the LMT (Local Memory Table) lines for PF/VF functions 2. **Configures LMT lines**: Sets `LMT_MAP_ENTRY_LINES` to 0x6 (which corresponds to 2048 LMTLINES according to the comment) 3. **Simplifies index calculation**: Changes from using `rvu->hw->total_vfs` to a fixed `LMT_MAX_VFS` (256) for calculating table indices ## Why this is NOT a security vulnerability: 1. **Functional fix, not security**: The commit is fixing missing functionality - enabling LMT lines that were supposed to be enabled but weren't. This is a functional correctness issue. 2. **No security implications**: - The LMT (Local Memory Table) functionality appears to be a performance optimization feature for memory operations - The changes only affect hardware configuration settings to enable proper operation - There's no indication of access control bypasses, privilege escalation, or information disclosure 3. **References historical similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also fixes register offset calculation - functional fix - Similar Commit 2 (CVE): Memory leak fix - resource management issue - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): Register translation fix - functional correctness - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Priority allocation fix - functional correctness - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Array bounds check - defensive programming 4. **Fixes tag indicates functional issue**: The commit has a "Fixes:" tag pointing to the original implementation, indicating this is completing/correcting the intended functionality rather than fixing a vulnerability. The pattern shows that functional/correctness fixes in this hardware abstraction layer typically don't receive CVEs unless they involve memory safety issues (like the memory leak in Similar Commit 2). This commit is purely about enabling hardware features correctly.
b2df03ed4052e crypto: algif_hash - fix double free in hash_accept
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue completely. Let me analyze this step by step: **Analysis:** **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** This is a classic **double-free vulnerability** that can lead to slab-use-after-free, which has significant security implications: 1. **The Vulnerability**: In the `hash_accept()` function, when `crypto_ahash_import()` fails, the code calls: ```c if (err) { sock_orphan(sk2); sock_put(sk2); // First free here } ``` 2. **The Double-Free**: However, `sk2` (the socket) is also automatically freed later by the socket layer through `af_alg_release()`, which calls `sock_put(sock->sk)` - causing a **second free** of the same object. 3. **Security Impact**: This double-free vulnerability can lead to: - **Slab-use-after-free**: The freed memory can be reallocated and used for other purposes - **Memory corruption**: Writing to freed memory can corrupt other kernel data structures - **Potential privilege escalation**: In kernel context, memory corruption can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation - **System crashes**: At minimum, this can cause kernel panics 4. **Attack Surface**: This affects the user-space crypto API (`algif_hash`), which is accessible to unprivileged users, making it a significant security concern. 5. **Comparison to Similar CVEs**: Looking at the historical similar commits marked as "CVE Status: YES", this follows the same pattern as: - Similar Commit 2: "af_unix: fix use-after-free" - Similar Commit 4 & 5: "scsi: sg: Fix slab-use-after-free read in sg_release()" All of these involve use-after-free scenarios in kernel code with user-accessible interfaces. The fix correctly removes the manual `sock_orphan(sk2); sock_put(sk2);` calls, letting the socket layer handle the cleanup automatically, thus preventing the double-free.
a6ae7129819ad octeontx2-af: Fix APR entry mapping based on APR_LMT_CFG
- [sasha] Let me analyze the security impact by understanding what the bug was: **NO** This commit fixes a bug in debugfs mapping calculation but does not appear to have security implications warranting a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Debugfs-only Impact**: The primary issue is in the `rvu_dbg_lmtst_map_table_display()` function in debugfs, which is used only for debugging and diagnostics. 2. **Incorrect Mapping Calculation**: The original code used a fixed mapping size of 128KB (`LMT_MAP_TABLE_SIZE`) and calculated indices using `rvu->hw->total_vfs`, while the fix dynamically calculates the mapping size based on APR_LMT_CFG register values (`apr_pfs Cargo.lock Cargo.toml bippy cve_classifier cve_utils dyad explain model prompt target verhaal_rs voting_results apr_vfs Cargo.lock Cargo.toml bippy cve_classifier cve_utils dyad explain model prompt target verhaal_rs voting_results LMT_MAPTBL_ENTRY_SIZE`). 3. **No Memory Corruption**: The bug caused incorrect **display** of APR table entries in debugfs rather than actual memory corruption. The `ioremap_wc()` call maps the correct physical memory region, but the size calculation was wrong, leading to potential access beyond the intended table boundaries during reading. 4. **Limited Impact**: While this could potentially cause incorrect memory access when reading the debugfs file, it's: - Limited to debugfs (typically root-only access) - A read operation that displays mapping information - Not affecting actual hardware operation or data integrity 5. **No Security Boundary Violation**: This doesn't allow privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or compromise system security. It's a functional bug that could cause incorrect debugging output or potential crashes when the mapped region is smaller than expected. The fix is important for correct operation but represents a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability.
efabce2901518 octeontx2-pf: AF_XDP zero copy receive support
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the code changes provided: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This commit introduces a **new feature** (AF_XDP zero copy receive support) rather than fixing an existing security vulnerability. The code changes show proper implementation patterns and security considerations: ## Security Analysis ### 1. **Memory Management - SECURE** - Proper allocation/deallocation patterns using `xsk_buff_alloc()` and `xsk_buff_free()` - Error handling for failed allocations with `return -ENOMEM` - Cleanup paths properly implemented in `otx2_free_aura_ptr()` and `otx2_cleanup_rx_cqes()` ### 2. **Input Validation - SECURE** - Queue ID bounds checking: `if (qidx >= rx_queues || qidx >= tx_queues) return -EINVAL` - Pool validation: `if (!pool) return -EINVAL` - Interface state checking: `if (pf->flags & OTX2_FLAG_INTF_DOWN) return -ENETDOWN` ### 3. **Buffer Management - SECURE** - Proper buffer tracking with `pool->xdp[pool->xdp_top++]` and bounds management - Safe buffer freeing in error paths - XDP buffer handling follows standard kernel patterns ### 4. **Similar Patterns in Reference Commits** Looking at the provided similar commits: - Commits with **CVE Status: YES** were all **error handling fixes** (missing `IS_ERR()` checks) - Commits with **CVE Status: NO** were **cleanups** or **new feature additions** - This commit follows the pattern of **new feature addition**, not vulnerability fixes ### 5. **No Security Anti-patterns Found** - No missing bounds checks - No buffer overflow opportunities - No privilege escalation vectors - No race conditions in the implementation - Standard kernel XDP/XSK API usage ## Conclusion This is a **feature enhancement commit** that adds AF_XDP zero copy support with proper security considerations. It does not introduce vulnerabilities and follows secure coding practices consistent with other non-CVE kernel changes.
e279024617134 net/tipc: fix slab-use-after-free Read in tipc_aead_encrypt_done
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context from the kernel tree, I can now provide my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Security Vulnerability**: This is a classic use-after-free vulnerability with confirmed memory safety implications. The KASAN report shows slab-use-after-free access, which is a serious security issue. 2. **Exploitability**: The commit provides a clear reproduction case showing that the vulnerability can be triggered by standard network namespace operations (creating/deleting namespaces, enabling TIPC bearers). This makes it potentially exploitable by unprivileged users who can manipulate network namespaces. 3. **Security-Critical Component**: The vulnerability affects TIPC's encryption/authentication mechanism (`tipc_aead_encrypt_done` in `net/tipc/crypto.c`), which is a security-sensitive component. Use-after-free in cryptographic code paths can have severe security implications. 4. **Race Condition with Memory Cleanup**: The core issue is a race between asynchronous crypto operations (running in workqueue context) and namespace cleanup. When a namespace is deleted, the `tipc_crypto` structure is freed, but the async callback `tipc_aead_encrypt_done` may still execute later and access the freed memory. 5. **Pattern Consistent with Historical CVEs**: This matches the pattern of the reference commits that were assigned CVEs - all are use-after-free vulnerabilities in network components that can be triggered through normal operations and have memory safety implications. The fix properly addresses the race by holding a network namespace reference during the async operation (`get_net`/`put_net`), ensuring the crypto structures remain valid during the callback execution. This follows standard kernel patterns for preventing use-after-free in async contexts.
94c80f7488735 octeontx2-pf: use xdp_return_frame() to free xdp buffers
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and comparison with similar commits, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a **memory management improvement/cleanup** that moves from manual page management to proper XDP framework functions (`xdp_return_frame()`). It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather improving code quality and correctness. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit message and code changes show this is about using the correct XDP API functions rather than fixing a security flaw. The old code used `put_page()` while the new code uses `xdp_return_frame()`, which is the proper way to handle XDP frames. 3. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs (Examples 1, 2, 4, 5) were all about **error handling fixes** - specifically adding missing `IS_ERR()` checks after `otx2_mbox_get_rsp()` calls. These missing error checks could lead to dereferencing error pointers, which is a clear security vulnerability. In contrast, this commit is about using the correct memory management API. 4. **Code improvement vs. vulnerability fix**: The changes improve memory management by: - Using `xdp_return_frame()` instead of manual `put_page()` - Adding proper page pool recycling for XDP_DROP case - These are correctness improvements, not security fixes 5. **No indication of exploitability**: There's no evidence in the commit message or code changes that the previous implementation had exploitable security implications. This commit represents good software engineering practice (using the correct APIs) rather than a security fix, and therefore does not warrant a CVE assignment.
ef0841e4cb087 can: slcan: allow reception of short error messages
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it removes a length validation check, this is a bug fix that enables legitimate protocol functionality rather than introducing a vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security Issue**: The commit fixes a discrepancy between protocol specification and implementation. Valid 3-character error messages (like "e1a") were being incorrectly discarded due to an outdated minimum length check that wasn't updated when error support was added in commit b32ff4668544. 2. **Defense-in-Depth Preserved**: The individual message handler functions (`slcan_bump_frame()`, `slcan_bump_err()`, `slcan_bump_state()`) each have their own appropriate length validation: - `slcan_bump_frame()` checks for minimum 5 characters - `slcan_bump_err()` checks for minimum 3 characters - `slcan_bump_state()` requires exact length matching 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: Even though the global length check is removed, malformed short messages (1-2 characters) will be safely rejected by the individual handlers before any processing occurs. 4. **No Memory Safety Impact**: The change doesn't introduce buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues. The individual bounds checks in each handler function prevent any out-of-bounds access. 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples, commits that receive CVEs in CAN drivers typically involve more serious issues like missing initialization (Similar Commit 4), race conditions leading to use-after-free (Similar Commit 3,5), or missing error handling that could cause system instability. This commit simply adjusts validation logic to match the intended protocol behavior. The commit correctly enables legitimate error message functionality that was inadvertently broken, with appropriate safety checks still in place at the handler level.
b4164de5041b5 octeontx2-pf: Add AF_XDP non-zero copy support
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a comprehensive assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis ### What the commit does: 1. **Functional Fix**: This commit adds proper AF_XDP (Address Family XDP) support by registering the XDP RX queue memory model as `MEM_TYPE_PAGE_POOL` 2. **Memory Management**: It connects the page pool to the XDP RX queue info using `xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model()`, which is required for `xdp_return_frame()` to work correctly with page pools ### Why it's not a security vulnerability: 1. **Infrastructure/API Fix**: This is a straightforward infrastructure fix to properly integrate with the kernel's XDP memory management system. The commit correctly registers the memory model that was missing in the original XDP implementation. 2. **No Security Impact**: - The change doesn't introduce new attack vectors - It doesn't fix memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control issues - It doesn't address privilege escalation or information disclosure - No sensitive components are being protected 3. **Functionality vs Security**: The commit message clearly states this is needed "since xdp_return_frame internally will use page pools." This is purely a functional requirement to make AF_XDP work correctly, not a security fix. 4. **Pattern Recognition**: Comparing with similar commits: - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are typically infrastructure improvements or code quality fixes - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involve error handling for potential NULL pointer dereferences or other security-relevant conditions - This commit pattern matches the "NO" category - it's an infrastructure completion 5. **Context from kernel tree**: The related commit `94c80f748873` shows this is part of a series to properly implement XDP frame handling with page pools, which is standard kernel networking infrastructure work. This is a classic example of a **functional fix** to complete an API integration rather than a **security fix**.
184fb40f731bd octeontx2-pf: Avoid adding dcbnl_ops for LBK and SDP vf
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis This commit fixes a **functional bug** rather than a security vulnerability. The code change adds a conditional check to prevent registering DCB netlink operations (`dcbnl_ops`) for LBK (loopback) and SDP (Service Data Plane) VF devices that don't support Priority Flow Control. ### Key Findings: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit prevents calling `otx2_dcbnl_set_ops()` on unsupported device types. Looking at the implementation, this function only: - Allocates memory for `queue_to_pfc_map` - Sets `dev->dcbnl_ops = &otx2_dcbnl_ops` 2. **Functional Fix**: The issue is that these device types don't support PFC hardware features. Without this fix, userspace could attempt DCB configuration that would fail or behave incorrectly, but not cause security issues. 3. **Error Handling**: The code has proper error handling - if `otx2_dcbnl_set_ops()` fails, it returns an error code and follows the standard cleanup path. 4. **No Memory Corruption Risk**: Unlike the similar commits that add `IS_ERR()` checks (which fix potential null pointer dereferences), this commit only adds a feature availability check. 5. **Comparison to CVE-worthy Similar Commits**: The similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" all fix missing error handling after `otx2_mbox_get_rsp()` calls, which could lead to null pointer dereferences. This commit addresses a different type of issue. ### Conclusion: This is a **hardware capability/feature restriction fix** that prevents misconfiguration rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The change ensures DCB operations are only available on devices that actually support them, improving system stability and preventing user confusion, but not addressing any exploitable security flaw.
407e0efdf8baf idpf: fix idpf_vport_splitq_napi_poll()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me now consider the security implications of this NAPI rule violation. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Bug:** The issue is a NAPI protocol violation where `idpf_vport_splitq_napi_poll()` can return `budget` after calling `napi_complete_done()`. According to NAPI rules, after `napi_complete_done()` is called, the current thread loses ownership of the NAPI instance, and returning `budget` at that point violates the expected protocol. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Protocol Violation, Not Memory Safety**: This is a violation of kernel networking API protocol rules rather than a memory safety issue. The fix simply reorders the logic to check for `POLL_MODE` before calling `napi_complete_done()`. 2. **No Direct Attack Vector**: The bug affects the NAPI polling mechanism's state management but doesn't provide a direct way for an attacker to exploit it for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service. 3. **Administrative Access Required**: The IDPF driver is for Intel infrastructure data path function devices, which typically require administrative privileges to configure and use. 4. **Functional Correctness Issue**: This appears to be a functional correctness bug that could potentially cause networking performance issues or unexpected behavior in edge cases, but not security vulnerabilities. 5. **Similar Historical Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided as references, functional networking fixes like NAPI polling corrections (similar to commits 1, 3, and 4 in the reference list) are typically not assigned CVEs unless they have clear security implications. The fix is straightforward - moving the `POLL_MODE` check before `napi_complete_done()` - and addresses a protocol compliance issue rather than a security flaw.
47653e4243f2b net: dwmac-sun8i: Use parsed internal PHY address instead of 1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context from the kernel tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **The commit is a code quality/correctness fix, not a security fix**: The change restores the use of the parsed PHY address from device-tree instead of a hardcoded value of 1. This was accidentally broken in commit 634db83b8265. 2. **No security implications**: The H3_EPHY_ADDR_SHIFT (value 20) is used to position the PHY address in bits 24:20 of a system control register. Whether the address is hardcoded as 1 or parsed from device-tree doesn't create a security vulnerability - it's just about correct hardware configuration. 3. **Functional impact is minimal**: While the hardcoded value 1 was "more fragile and not future-proof" as stated in the commit message, it didn't actually break anything since most Allwinner sun8i chips do have their internal PHY at MDIO address 1. 4. **Similar commits analysis**: All the similar commits provided are marked "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar device driver configuration issues, MDIO handling, and hardware variant support - none with security implications. 5. **No security-sensitive components affected**: This is a network driver configuration issue affecting PHY address assignment, not memory management, access control, input validation, or other security-critical areas. The commit message explicitly states this "didn't really break anything but is more fragile and not future-proof" - indicating this is a robustness improvement rather than a security fix.
b95ed5517354a xsk: Bring back busy polling support in XDP_COPY
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the surrounding context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary **What the commit does:** - Extends busy polling support to XDP_COPY mode by removing the `xs->zc &&` condition in the napi_id setup code - Changes line 1307 from `if (xs->zc && qid < dev->real_num_rx_queues)` to `if (qid < dev->real_num_rx_queues)` - This allows both XDP_COPY and XDP_ZEROCOPY modes to set up busy polling, whereas previously only XDP_ZEROCOPY was supported **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Feature Restoration, Not Security Fix**: This commit restores a broken feature (busy polling for XDP_COPY) rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's bringing back functionality that was broken by a previous change. 2. **No Security-Sensitive Operations**: The code change only affects when the `napi_id` is set up for busy polling. This is a performance optimization feature, not a security control mechanism. 3. **Proper Validation Remains**: The commit message explicitly states that "xsk_rcv_check checks that the rx queue at which the packet arrives is equal to the queue_id that was supplied in bind. This is done for both XDP_COPY and XDP_ZEROCOPY mode." The existing security checks remain intact. 4. **No Access Control or Memory Safety Issues**: The change doesn't introduce buffer overflows, memory leaks, privilege escalation, race conditions, or other security-relevant patterns. 5. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" include similar feature fixes and performance improvements, while "CVE Status: YES" commits involve actual race conditions and memory corruption issues. **Conclusion:** This is a straightforward feature restoration that extends an existing performance optimization to work consistently across both XDP operation modes. There are no security implications in enabling busy polling for XDP_COPY mode when the same mechanism was already safely available for XDP_ZEROCOPY mode.
41e452e6933d1 pinctrl: qcom: switch to devm_register_sys_off_handler()
- [sasha] **YES** This commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability. The original code registers a restart handler in `msm_pinctrl_setup_pm_reset()` during probe, but if any subsequent probe steps fail, the handler remains registered while pointing to potentially freed memory. During system restart, this could lead to kernel crashes when the dangling restart handler is invoked. The fix switches to `devm_register_sys_off_handler()` which automatically cleans up the handler on probe failure, preventing the use-after-free condition. This represents a legitimate security vulnerability that could cause system instability during critical restart operations.
2dabe349f7882 idpf: fix null-ptr-deref in idpf_features_check
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ## Security Impact The commit fixes a **NULL pointer dereference leading to kernel crash**. The commit message includes a clear stack trace showing: ``` BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000068 RIP: 0010:idpf_features_check+0x6d/0xe0 [idpf] ``` ## Vulnerability Details The issue occurs in `idpf_features_check()` which is called in the network transmission path. During device reset, the `vport` pointer becomes NULL, but the function continues to be called for packet validation: **Vulnerable code:** ```c - struct idpf_vport *vport = idpf_netdev_to_vport(netdev); - struct idpf_adapter *adapter = vport->adapter; // NULL deref here ``` **Fixed code:** ```c + struct idpf_netdev_priv *np = netdev_priv(netdev); + u16 max_tx_hdr_size = np->max_tx_hdr_size; // Safe cached value ``` ## Easy to Trigger This vulnerability can be triggered during normal network operations when a device reset occurs - a common scenario. The crash happens in the network hot path (`netif_skb_features` → `validate_xmit_skb` → `__dev_queue_xmit`), making it easily accessible. ## Consistent with Historical Precedent All provided similar commits fixing NULL pointer dereferences that cause kernel crashes were marked **"CVE Status: YES"**: - Similar Commits 1 & 2: "idpf: fix adapter NULL pointer dereference" - Similar Commit 3: "RDMA/irdma: Fix potential NULL-ptr-dereference" - Similar Commit 4: "xsk: fix usage of multi-buffer BPF helpers" (NULL deref causing kernel panic) - Similar Commit 5: "net: phy: micrel: Fix potential null pointer dereference" This represents a clear **denial of service vulnerability** with kernel crash capability that warrants CVE assignment.
c46286fdd6aa1 mr: consolidate the ipmr_can_free_table() checks.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a pure code cleanup/refactoring commit that consolidates duplicate debugging/sanity check functions. The changes are: - Moving `ipmr_can_free_table()` and `ip6mr_can_free_table()` functions into a single shared `mr_can_free_table()` function in the header file - Updating the call sites to use the new shared function - No change in the actual logic or security checks 2. **Cosmetic Fix**: The commit addresses a kernel warning (WARN_ON_ONCE) that was triggered by a syzkaller test, but this warning is a debugging assertion, not a security issue. The warning occurs when trying to free multicast routing tables under incorrect conditions. 3. **No Privilege Escalation or Attack Vector**: The issue only affects kernel warning messages and code organization. There's no indication that this could be exploited for privilege escalation, denial of service (beyond the warning), or any other security attack. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar Commits 1 & 2 (NO CVE): Also involve RCU locking fixes in multicast routing without security implications - Similar Commits 3, 4, & 5 (YES CVE): These involved actual functional bugs that could cause crashes, assertion failures with real security impact, or improper state handling 5. **Fixes Tag Context**: The "Fixes:" tag references commit 50b94204446e, which itself was also a non-security fix that tuned debugging checks to prevent false warnings during namespace cleanup. The core issue here is that different kernel configurations (with/without `CONFIG_IP_MROUTE_MULTIPLE_TABLES`) had different debugging check logic, causing spurious warnings. The consolidation ensures consistent behavior across configurations but doesn't fix any exploitable security vulnerability.
bbd95160a03db ice: fix vf->num_mac count with port representors
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes an accounting issue, not a security vulnerability. The bug causes `vf->num_mac` to become out of sync by incorrectly incrementing the counter in representor mode when MAC filters aren't actually programmed to firmware. Key reasons this doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **Pure accounting error**: The code change removes a single line `vf->num_mac++;` - this is book-keeping, not a security fix 2. **No direct security impact**: While the commit mentions it could affect filter limits on untrusted VFs, there's no evidence of actual bypass or exploitation 3. **Pattern consistency**: The historical commits show MAC/VLAN filter accounting fixes are consistently marked "CVE Status: NO" while actual security issues like reference counting bugs get "CVE Status: YES" 4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects representor mode, a specific switchdev configuration 5. **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption patterns This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 which were all accounting/filter management fixes marked as non-security issues, versus Similar Commit 4 which had actual reference counting vulnerabilities and received a CVE.
91b6dbced0ef1 bridge: netfilter: Fix forwarding of fragmented packets
- [sasha] **CVE Analysis:** **NO** This commit fixes a packet forwarding issue but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **No crash or system compromise**: The issue causes packet drops via `kfree_skb(skb)` in `br_nf_ip_fragment()` when `ip_skb_dst_mtu()` returns 1500 instead of the actual bridge MTU, but does not cause kernel panics or crashes. 2. **Functionality fix, not security fix**: This addresses incorrect MTU handling that prevents proper fragmented packet forwarding in bridge netfilter scenarios with high MTU configurations (e.g., 9k). The fix ensures the bridge's fake rtable metrics are writable (`dst_init_metrics(&rt->dst, br->metrics, false)`) so MTU changes are properly reflected. 3. **Limited denial of service potential**: While packet drops could theoretically impact availability, this is a specific networking configuration issue rather than an exploitable vulnerability. The drops occur due to incorrect MTU calculations, not due to malicious input validation failures. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike the CVE=YES examples that fix NULL pointer dereferences causing kernel panics, this commit addresses a functional networking issue similar to the CVE=NO examples that fix RCU usage and correctness issues without security implications. The code changes in `net/bridge/br_nf_core.c:dst_init_metrics(&rt->dst, br->metrics, false)` and `net/bridge/br_private.h:u32 metrics[RTAX_MAX]` are purely functional improvements to ensure proper MTU handling in bridge forwarding scenarios.
c9e455581e2ba ptp: ocp: Limit signal/freq counts in summary output functions
- [sasha] **YES** This commit fixes a clear security vulnerability involving NULL pointer dereferences that can cause kernel crashes. The code changes show that debugfs summary functions were accessing uninitialized array elements in `freq_in[]` and `signal_out[]` arrays, particularly on ADVA boards which only initialize 2 out of 4 array elements. The fix adds proper bounds checking (`bp->signals_nr` and `bp->freq_in_nr`) to prevent out-of-bounds access. This matches the pattern of similar commits that received CVE assignments for fixing NULL pointer dereferences and buffer overflow issues in `drivers/ptp/ptp_ocp.c:4185-4186`.
4bcb0c7dc2544 Bluetooth: btusb: use skb_pull to avoid unsafe access in QCA dump handling
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. The code changes fix a memory safety vulnerability where unsafe pointer arithmetic in QCA Bluetooth dump packet handling could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. Specifically: 1. **Vulnerability:** The original code performed pointer arithmetic (`sk_ptr += HCI_ACL_HDR_SIZE`, `sk_ptr += HCI_EVENT_HDR_SIZE`) and direct casting (`dump_hdr = (struct qca_dump_hdr *)sk_ptr`) without proper bounds checking, allowing potential access beyond the skb buffer boundaries. 2. **Security Impact:** A malicious or malformed Bluetooth packet shorter than expected could trigger out-of-bounds reads, potentially leading to information disclosure (kernel memory leakage) or kernel crashes. 3. **Fix Pattern:** The commit replaces unsafe pointer arithmetic with `skb_pull()` and `skb_pull_data()` functions that perform bounds checking and return NULL on insufficient data, preventing the security issue. 4. **Comparison:** This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 1, 4, and 5 (all CVE: YES) which fix memory safety issues in Bluetooth code, particularly involving unsafe buffer handling that could lead to memory corruption or information disclosure. The fix addresses a clear security vulnerability in kernel code that handles untrusted network data, making it appropriate for CVE assignment.
08fb624802d87 irqchip/riscv-imsic: Start local sync timer on correct CPU
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the similar commits provided for reference, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is in the `__imsic_local_timer_start()` function where the timer was being started on the wrong CPU (`smp_processor_id()` instead of the target `cpu` parameter). This causes interrupt delivery delays, not security issues. 2. **Impact analysis**: The commit message states this "results in interrupt delivery being delayed until the timer eventually runs... on the target CPU." This is a performance/functionality issue - interrupts are delayed but not lost, leaked, or causing privilege violations. 3. **Code changes**: The fixes are simple parameter corrections: - `add_timer_on(&lpriv->timer, smp_processor_id())` → `add_timer_on(&lpriv->timer, cpu)` - In `__imsic_remote_sync()`: `__imsic_local_timer_start(lpriv)` → `__imsic_local_timer_start(lpriv, cpu)` 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (spinlock changes, CPU hotplug fixes, domain initialization fixes, output text corrections) were marked as "CVE Status: NO". These are functional/correctness fixes, not security vulnerabilities. 5. **No security implications**: The bug doesn't involve: - Memory corruption or buffer overflows - Privilege escalation or access control bypass - Information disclosure - Denial of service (interrupts are delayed, not lost) - Race conditions with security implications The RISC-V IMSIC (Interrupt Management Subsystem Interrupt Controller) bug affects interrupt delivery timing between CPUs but doesn't create exploitable security conditions. It's a correctness fix for proper interrupt controller operation.
7dd7f39fce002 ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Fix UAF when reloading module
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Security Issue**: This is a classic Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability that occurs when reloading a kernel module. The commit message explicitly documents a UAF bug with a complete KFENCE crash report. **Vulnerability Details**: 1. **UAF Pattern**: The code was modifying a global variable `snd_soc_acpi_intel_hda_machines` by storing a pointer to device-managed memory allocated with `devm_kasprintf()` 2. **Memory Lifecycle Issue**: When the module is unloaded, the device-managed memory is freed, but the global variable still points to this freed memory 3. **Trigger Condition**: Reloading the module triggers access to the freed memory, causing a UAF **Code Changes Show Clear Fix**: - The fix replaces direct assignment to the global array (`hda_mach = snd_soc_acpi_intel_hda_machines;`) - With creating a local copy using `devm_kmemdup_array()` before modifications - This prevents modification of the global variable that would persist after module unload **Security Impact**: UAF vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for: - Kernel crashes (DoS) - Memory corruption - Potential privilege escalation if the freed memory can be controlled **Similar CVE Patterns**: The provided examples show that UAF fixes consistently receive CVEs (commits 1, 3, and 5 are all UAF fixes marked as "CVE Status: YES"), establishing this as a security-relevant bug class. The fix addresses a clear memory safety issue that could be triggered by normal module load/unload operations, making it a legitimate security vulnerability deserving of a CVE identifier.
a103b833ac380 devres: Introduce devm_kmemdup_array()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit introduces a new function (`devm_kmemdup_array()`) that provides safer array duplication with overflow protection, but it does not fix an existing security vulnerability. Key reasons this doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **Proactive Enhancement**: This adds a new API that uses `size_mul()` for overflow-safe multiplication, following the pattern of other safe allocation functions like `kmalloc_array()` and `kcalloc()`. 2. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit doesn't repair a specific security flaw in existing code. Instead, it provides a tool to prevent future vulnerabilities when developers need to duplicate arrays. 3. **Similar to Non-CVE Patterns**: This follows the same pattern as the first three similar commits (which were marked "NO") - they add safety checks or safer APIs without fixing existing vulnerabilities. 4. **Infrastructure Addition**: Like `devm_krealloc()` improvements in the similar commits, this is an enhancement to the devres infrastructure rather than a security fix. The function itself is security-positive as it prevents integer overflow in array size calculations, but since it doesn't fix an existing exploitable vulnerability, it doesn't qualify for a CVE assignment.
a21cad9312767 driver core: Split devres APIs to device/devres.h
- [sasha] Now I have the complete picture. Let me analyze this commit: ## Analysis This commit is a **code refactoring** that moves device resource management (devres) APIs from `include/linux/device.h` to a new dedicated header file `include/linux/device/devres.h`. ### Key Changes: 1. **Moves API declarations**: All devres-related function declarations and typedefs are moved from `device.h` to the new `devres.h` header 2. **Adds proper includes**: The new header includes necessary dependencies like `<linux/err.h>`, `<linux/overflow.h>`, etc. 3. **Maintains API compatibility**: The old `device.h` now includes the new `devres.h`, so all existing code continues to work 4. **Fixes sparse warnings**: Changes `ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` to `IOMEM_ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)` for proper __iomem pointer handling ### Security Analysis: - **No functional changes**: This is purely a code organization change. All APIs remain exactly the same - **No new vulnerabilities**: The refactoring doesn't introduce any new security vulnerabilities - **No fixes for existing vulnerabilities**: This doesn't fix any security issues - **Sparse warning fix**: The `IOMEM_ERR_PTR()` change is a correctness improvement for static analysis, not a security fix ### Comparison with Similar Commits: Looking at the historical examples provided, all similar code reorganization/refactoring commits (like "Create a header for internal sharing", "introduce device_set_driver() helper", etc.) were marked as **CVE Status: NO** because they are purely structural changes without security implications. **NO** This commit is a pure code refactoring that moves devres APIs to a separate header file for better organization and build performance. It introduces no functional changes, fixes no security vulnerabilities, and creates no new attack surfaces. The only code change beyond moving declarations is using `IOMEM_ERR_PTR()` instead of `ERR_PTR()` for proper sparse annotation, which is a code quality improvement rather than a security fix.
99bcd91fabada perf/x86/intel: Fix segfault with PEBS-via-PT with sample_freq
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a local denial of service vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Leading to Kernel Crash**: The commit message explicitly states this causes a "kernel NULL pointer dereference" and "segfault" with a clear crash stack trace showing the kernel panic in `intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain()`. 2. **User-Triggerable via Syscall Interface**: The crash occurs when using PEBS-via-PT with `sample_freq`, which can be triggered through the `perf_event_open()` syscall. While this typically requires elevated privileges, many systems may have relaxed perf permissions or specific configurations that allow user access. 3. **System-Wide Impact**: A kernel NULL pointer dereference causes a complete system crash requiring reboot, affecting all users and processes on the system. 4. **Code Analysis**: The fix changes `intel_pmu_pebs_event_update_no_drain()` to properly mask the counter bits instead of assuming all `pebs_enabled` bits represent valid counter indexes. The bug occurs because bits 60 and 61 are used for PEBS-via-PT purposes but were being treated as counter indexes, leading to out-of-bounds access. 5. **Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided, kernel crashes in performance monitoring subsystems consistently receive CVE assignments when they can be triggered by user code (similar to CVE-2021-47346 and other perf-related crashes). This represents a clear local denial of service vulnerability where specific but achievable conditions can cause a system-wide crash through a NULL pointer dereference in kernel space.
5e27af0514e22 dmaengine: fsl-edma: Fix return code for unhandled interrupts
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** The commit fixes an interrupt handler return code issue in the `fsl_edma3_tx_handler` function. The bug was that when an interrupt was received but the handler determined it wasn't for the current channel (intr == 0), it was returning `IRQ_HANDLED` instead of `IRQ_NONE`. **Code Change Analysis:** ```c - return IRQ_HANDLED; + return IRQ_NONE; ``` This is a single-line change that corrects the return value when no interrupt was actually handled. **Security Impact Assessment:** 1. **No Memory Safety Issues**: This doesn't involve buffer overflows, memory corruption, or access control bypasses 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug doesn't affect security boundaries or permissions 3. **No Information Disclosure**: No sensitive data is exposed 4. **Functional Bug Only**: This is purely a driver correctness issue affecting interrupt handling semantics **Comparison with Similar Commits:** Looking at the historical examples provided, the commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" involve actual security vulnerabilities like memory leaks or resource management issues that could potentially be exploited. The commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are functional fixes without security implications, similar to this one. **Technical Impact:** In shared interrupt scenarios (like fsl,imx93-edma4), returning `IRQ_HANDLED` instead of `IRQ_NONE` could prevent other interrupt handlers from processing the same IRQ line. However, this would lead to system malfunction rather than security vulnerabilities. This is a functional correctness fix for proper interrupt sharing behavior, not a security vulnerability.
ae74cd15ade83 dmaengine: idxd: Fix ->poll() return value
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a pure bug fix that corrects a return type mismatch, not a security vulnerability fix itself. 2. **What the commit does**: The commit changes the return value in the `idxd_cdev_poll()` function from `-EPERM` (an integer error code) to `POLLNVAL` (a proper `__poll_t` flag), fixing a type mismatch that the kernel test bot detected. 3. **Security context**: While this commit is fixing a follow-up issue from commit `8dfa57aabff6` (which WAS a security fix addressing cross-address-space access), this specific change only corrects the return type and doesn't introduce or fix any security vulnerability. 4. **Code change impact**: - The security check `if (current->mm != ctx->mm)` remains identical - The only change is returning `POLLNVAL` instead of `-EPERM` - Both values reject the operation, but `POLLNVAL` is the correct `__poll_t` type for poll operations - `POLLNVAL` indicates "invalid request" which is semantically appropriate 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: This matches the pattern of "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 4" which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - these are corrective fixes that improve code correctness but don't address security vulnerabilities themselves. **Conclusion**: This is a technical correctness fix for a return type, not a security vulnerability fix. The security boundary established by the original commit `8dfa57aabff6` remains intact and functional.
0b91fda3a1f04 xfrm: Sanitize marks before insert
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Security Policy Bypass**: The issue allows users to create XFRM states/policies with marks that will never match any packets due to improper sanitization. This effectively creates "dead" security policies that appear configured but don't actually provide the intended protection. 2. **Input Validation Flaw**: Similar to Similar Commit 3 (which got a CVE), this is fundamentally an input validation issue where user-provided mark values weren't properly sanitized before storage, leading to inconsistent behavior between insertion and lookup paths. 3. **Real-world Impact**: The commit specifically mentions this was "discovered in Cilium" - a production networking/security tool - indicating this has real-world security implications for container orchestration and network policy enforcement. 4. **XFRM Security Context**: XFRM is a critical security subsystem for IPsec and network security policies. Any bypass or misconfiguration in this subsystem has significant security implications. 5. **Fixes Line**: The commit includes `Fixes: 3d6acfa7641f ("xfrm: SA lookups with mark")` indicating this corrects a long-standing vulnerability in the mark-based lookup mechanism. The code changes in `net/xfrm/xfrm_state.c` and `net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c` add essential sanitization (`x->mark.v &= x->mark.m` and `policy->mark.v &= policy->mark.m`) to ensure stored marks are properly masked, preventing the security policy bypass scenario.
98e6da673cc6d clk: sunxi-ng: d1: Add missing divider for MMC mod clocks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** - This is a hardware description bug where the MMC module clocks were incorrectly configured due to a missing "hidden divider of 2" in the clock definition - The commit changes `SUNXI_CCU_MP_DATA_WITH_MUX_GATE` to `SUNXI_CCU_MP_DATA_WITH_MUX_GATE_POSTDIV` and adds a post-divider of 2 for MMC clocks - This fixes a performance issue where MMC performance was only half of what it should be (11 MB/s instead of 23 MB/s) **Why This Is Not a Security Vulnerability:** 1. **No security implications**: This is purely a performance/correctness issue affecting MMC/SD card speed 2. **No privilege boundaries crossed**: The bug doesn't affect access controls, memory safety, or privilege escalation 3. **No data integrity issues**: The bug doesn't cause data corruption, just slower transfer speeds 4. **Hardware description bug**: This is a clock configuration issue, not a logic flaw that could be exploited 5. **Similar precedent**: Looking at the similar commits in the historical analysis, other clock configuration fixes (like the v3s postdivider fix in commit 47e4dc4e63e1) were not assigned CVEs **Comparison with CVE-marked commits:** The similar commits provided all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve clock configuration fixes, rate adjustments, and hardware description corrections - none of which constitute security vulnerabilities. This is a straightforward hardware description fix that improves MMC performance but has no security implications.
4ca45af0a56d0 remoteproc: qcom_wcnss: Fix on platforms without fallback regulators
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, code changes, and kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a logic error but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: The original commit (65991ea8a6d1) introduced a calculation error in `wcnss_init_regulators()` where `num_vregs += num_pd_vregs - wcnss->num_pds` could result in a negative value when `wcnss->num_pds >= num_pd_vregs`. For pronto-v3, `num_pd_vregs = 0` (no fallback regulators) but `wcnss->num_pds` could be > 0. 2. **Impact Analysis**: The negative `num_vregs` value would cause: - `devm_kcalloc()` to allocate either no memory or an unexpectedly small buffer due to integer underflow - Potential array access issues in the subsequent loops - Driver initialization failure rather than successful exploitation 3. **Memory Safety**: While this could theoretically cause memory corruption, the pattern here shows: - The allocation happens with `devm_kcalloc()` which would likely fail safely on negative/underflow values - The driver would fail to initialize rather than continue with corrupted state - This affects driver functionality rather than creating an exploitable condition 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, those marked "CVE Status: NO" involve similar power domain handling fixes that affect driver functionality without creating security vulnerabilities. 5. **Fix Nature**: The fix adds a simple bounds check (`if (wcnss->num_pds < num_pd_vregs)`) to prevent the problematic calculation, which is a standard defensive programming practice rather than a security hardening measure. This appears to be a driver correctness/reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
e9f180d7cfde2 kernel/fork: only call untrack_pfn_clear() on VMAs duplicated for fork()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: ## Analysis of the Bug This is a correctness/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The bug causes incorrect handling of PAT (Page Attribute Table) reservations when `vm_area_dup()` is used outside of fork() operations (e.g., during `mprotect()`, `mremap()`, VMA splitting). The function was incorrectly calling `untrack_pfn_clear()` on all VM_PFNMAP VMAs, even when not doing fork(). 2. **Impact**: The bug leads to: - Incorrect PAT reservation management - Kernel warning messages like "freeing invalid memtype" - Potential memory resource leaks (reservations not properly cleaned up) - System instability in specific scenarios 3. **No Security Implications**: - This is **not** a memory corruption vulnerability - No privilege escalation potential - No information disclosure - No denial of service from user control - The error manifests as kernel warnings and resource management issues ## Comparison with Historical CVE Patterns Looking at the provided similar commits: - **CVE Status: YES commits** involve actual memory safety issues (fork() failures leading to dangerous state, VM_PAT flag handling bugs that could cause crashes) - **CVE Status: NO commits** are correctness fixes, performance improvements, or refactoring changes without security impact This commit falls into the second category - it's fixing incorrect PAT reservation accounting logic, similar to the mremap() bug fix (Similar Commit 3) which was also marked NO. ## Code Analysis The fix moves the `untrack_pfn_clear()` call from the generic `vm_area_dup()` function to only the fork-specific path in `dup_mmap()`. This prevents incorrect PAT cleanup in non-fork scenarios like VMA splitting during `mprotect()` or `mremap()` operations. While this is an important correctness fix that prevents kernel warnings and resource leaks, it does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
f7387eff4bad3 x86/sev: Fix operator precedence in GHCB_MSR_VMPL_REQ_LEVEL macro
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Limited Security Impact**: While this is an operator precedence bug, the security impact is limited. The bug causes incorrect VMPL (Virtual Machine Privilege Level) values to be generated when requesting VMPL1, but: - The current code only uses `GHCB_MSR_VMPL_REQ_LEVEL(0)` (requesting VMPL0) - There's no evidence of exploitation potential or privilege escalation - This affects communication protocol values but doesn't directly lead to memory corruption or access control bypass 2. **Comparison with CVE-assigned precedent**: The similar commit that received a CVE (mlx5e precedence bug) had direct memory safety implications - it caused out-of-bounds memory reads. In contrast, this bug generates incorrect protocol values but doesn't directly cause memory safety issues. 3. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a macro definition bug that generates incorrect bit patterns in protocol communication, not a vulnerability that can be directly exploited to compromise system security. 4. **Limited Scope**: The bug affects AMD SEV-SNP SVSM communication protocol values, which is a very specific and limited context compared to broader memory safety issues. While this is a correctness bug that needed fixing, it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it lacks clear exploitability and significant security impact.
e3fd057776858 xfrm: Fix UDP GRO handling for some corner cases
- [sasha] **YES** This commit fixes a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment. The key security issues are: 1. **Memory corruption vulnerability**: The code changes show a fix for packet corruption caused by incorrect buffer manipulation. The commit message explicitly states that "gro_pull_from_frag0() corrupted the packet" due to mismatched offset calculations between `pskb_pull()`/`skb_push()` operations. 2. **Network-accessible attack surface**: This affects UDP GRO handling for ESP-in-UDP packets, which can be triggered by crafted network packets from remote attackers targeting IPsec infrastructure. 3. **Memory safety impact**: The issue involves sk_buff length field mismatches that can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The commit shows replacement of dangerous `pskb_pull()`/`skb_push()` operations with safer `skb_gro_header()` calls to prevent buffer corruption. 4. **Security-critical context**: This affects IPsec (xfrm) packet processing, which handles encrypted network traffic. Corruption in this pathway could potentially lead to security policy bypass, information disclosure, or system compromise. 5. **Reference to similar CVE-worthy commits**: The commit fixes issues introduced by commits 172bf009c18d and 221ddb723d90, and similar packet corruption issues in UDP GRO handling have been assigned CVEs in the provided examples (Similar Commits 2 and 3). The combination of memory corruption potential, remote network accessibility, and impact on security-critical IPsec infrastructure makes this a clear security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
028363685bd0b espintcp: remove encap socket caching to avoid reference leak
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the kernel source tree, this commit should be assigned a CVE. **YES** This commit fixes a reference leak vulnerability in the ESP-in-TCP (espintcp) implementation that can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service. Here's the security analysis: **Security Impact:** 1. **Reference Leak Leading to Resource Exhaustion**: The commit message explicitly describes a reference chain `xfrm_state -> encap_sk -> netns` where socket caching can prevent proper cleanup of network namespaces. 2. **Denial of Service**: When network namespaces cannot be properly deleted due to reference leaks, this leads to memory leaks and resource exhaustion, potentially causing system instability or denial of service. **Key Evidence from Code Changes:** 1. **Removal of caching mechanism**: The code removes the `encap_sk` field from `struct xfrm_state` and eliminates the complex socket caching logic in both `esp4.c` and `esp6.c`. 2. **Reference management fixes**: Functions like `esp_free_tcp_sk()` and related RCU callback mechanisms are removed, indicating the previous implementation had problematic reference counting. 3. **Immediate socket release**: The new code calls `sock_put(sk)` immediately after use instead of caching the socket, ensuring proper reference counting. **Comparison to Similar CVE-assigned Commits:** This follows the same pattern as other reference leak fixes in the similar commit examples, particularly commits that address resource management issues in network namespaces and XFRM subsystem. The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially exhaust system resources through improper network namespace cleanup, making this a legitimate security issue requiring CVE assignment.
8dfa57aabff62 dmaengine: idxd: Fix allowing write() from different address spaces
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes an access control bypass where processes from different address spaces could submit DMA descriptors through file descriptors they shouldn't have access to. 2. **Access Control Pattern**: The code adds `if (current->mm != ctx->mm) return -EPERM;` checks in three critical functions (mmap, write, poll), which is a classic access control security fix pattern. 3. **DMA Security Risk**: DMA operations are inherently security-sensitive as they can access system memory directly. Allowing cross-process access to DMA submission capabilities represents a significant security boundary violation. 4. **Similar Precedent**: The historical examples show that other idxd security fixes have been assigned CVEs (Similar Commits 3 and 4), and this follows the same pattern of fixing security-critical access control issues. 5. **Explicit Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly describes preventing unauthorized access across address space boundaries, and the Fixes tag points to the vulnerable commit that introduced the write() method. 6. **Long Exposure Window**: The vulnerability existed for nearly a year (April 2024 to April 2025), suggesting it was a real security concern that needed addressing. The vulnerability allows unauthorized cross-process access to hardware DMA functionality, which could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation or unauthorized memory access.
fd15594ba7d55 soundwire: bus: Fix race on the creation of the IRQ domain
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a race condition but **does not** warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a timing/ordering issue where `sdw_irq_create()` is moved to occur before slave device enumeration (`sdw_acpi_find_slaves()` and `sdw_of_find_slaves()`). The race occurs when: - Slave devices are found and probed - During probing, if `slave->prop.use_domain_irq` is set, the code calls `irq_create_mapping(slave->bus->domain, slave->dev_num)` - But `bus->domain` might not be initialized yet if `sdw_irq_create()` hasn't run 2. **Impact Assessment**: - When `irq_create_mapping()` is called with a NULL domain (before `sdw_irq_create()` runs), it fails gracefully and returns 0 - The code handles this failure case with just a warning: `dev_warn(dev, "Failed to map IRQ\n")` - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or system compromise occurs - The device simply falls back to using the older `interrupt_callback` mechanism instead of IRQ domain handling 3. **Comparison to CVE-worthy commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES", they involved actual memory leaks, use-after-free conditions, or resource management failures that could lead to system instability or exploitation. This commit only fixes a functional ordering issue. 4. **Failure Mode**: The worst outcome is that some SoundWire peripheral devices fail to register IRQ handlers and must use the callback-based interrupt mechanism instead - this is degraded functionality, not a security vulnerability. This is a bug fix that improves functionality and prevents warnings, but does not address any security-relevant vulnerability that could be exploited.
63c1f19a3be31 espintcp: fix skb leaks
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ## Security Impact Analysis **1. Memory Leak Vulnerability in Security-Critical Code:** The commit fixes missing `kfree_skb()` calls in the ESP-in-TCP (espintcp) implementation, which is part of the IPsec subsystem. This creates memory leaks when error conditions occur in: - `esp_output_tcp_finish()` in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations - `espintcp_queue_out()` when the queue is full **2. Denial of Service Potential:** The memory leaks can be exploited for denial of service attacks: - Repeated triggering of these error paths leads to kernel memory exhaustion - The espintcp subsystem handles network packets, making this potentially exploitable remotely - Memory exhaustion can crash the system or degrade performance significantly **3. Security-Sensitive Context:** This affects the IPsec subsystem which: - Handles encrypted network traffic for VPNs and secure communications - Runs with full kernel privileges - Is commonly used in enterprise and critical infrastructure environments **4. Pattern Matching with CVE-Assigned Commits:** This commit follows the same pattern as the historical examples marked "CVE Status: YES": - Similar Commit 2: "net/x25: Fix skb leak" - CVE assigned for missing skb cleanup - Similar Commit 3: "net: ieee802154: ca8210: Stop leaking skb's" - CVE assigned for skb memory leak - Similar Commit 5: "tipc: fix a possible memleak in tipc_buf_append" - CVE assigned for skb memory leak The code changes show clear addition of `kfree_skb()` calls in error paths where skb structures were previously leaked, which is a classic pattern requiring CVE assignment due to the potential for memory exhaustion attacks.
90989869baae4 xenbus: Allow PVH dom0 a non-local xenstore
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Not a security fix**: This is a feature enhancement to support Hyperlaunch with xenstore stubdom for PVH dom0, not a vulnerability fix. 2. **Architectural change, not security issue**: The commit changes the logic for determining xenstore type (XS_LOCAL vs XS_HVM) based on whether an event channel is available, but this is an intentional architectural enhancement for a specific boot scenario. 3. **No security vulnerability patterns**: The code changes don't exhibit typical security vulnerability patterns like: - Buffer overflows or memory corruption - Access control bypasses - Input validation failures - Race conditions - Privilege escalation 4. **Consistent with similar commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided, this follows the same pattern as other xenstore/xenbus commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are infrastructure improvements rather than security fixes. 5. **Controlled environment change**: The change affects xenstore initialization logic in a controlled manner for a specific virtualization configuration (PVH dom0 with Hyperlaunch), which is an administrative/deployment enhancement rather than a security boundary issue. The commit message explicitly states this enables a new deployment model (Hyperlaunch with xenstore stubdom) rather than fixing any security issue.
db492e24f9b05 block: only update request sector if needed
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the core issue. This commit is changing when the bio sector gets updated. Let me understand the security implications: **Analysis:** This commit changes the condition for when a bio's sector is updated upon completion. The change is from: ```c if (req_op(rq) == REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND || bio_zone_write_plugging(bio)) ``` to: ```c if (req_op(rq) == REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND || bio_flagged(bio, BIO_EMULATES_ZONE_APPEND)) ``` **Key Points:** 1. **Purpose**: This is an optimization to avoid unnecessarily updating the sector for regular writes to zoned block devices. 2. **What changed**: Previously, ALL writes that went through zone write plugging (`BIO_ZONE_WRITE_PLUGGING` flag) would have their sector updated. Now, only native zone append operations (`REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND`) and emulated zone append operations (`BIO_EMULATES_ZONE_APPEND`) get their sector updated. 3. **Security analysis**: - This is NOT fixing a security vulnerability - This is a performance/correctness optimization - The commit message explicitly states it's to avoid "superfluously updates the sector for regular writes" - No security implications are mentioned - The change makes the logic more precise rather than fixing a bug 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the similar commits provided were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with zone append handling optimizations, error handling improvements, and correctness fixes - none were security-related. **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It's a performance optimization that makes the bio sector update logic more precise by only updating sectors when actually needed (for zone append operations) rather than for all zoned writes. The commit message clearly indicates this is about avoiding "superfluous" updates, not fixing any security issue or data corruption bug.
4720f9707c783 tools: ynl-gen: validate 0 len strings from kernel
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Scope**: This is a fix in userspace tools (`tools/net/ynl/lib/ynl.c`), not in the kernel itself. The YNL (Yet another Netlink Library) is a userspace library for interacting with netlink sockets. 2. **Nature of the vulnerability**: The issue is a potential buffer underflow in the expression `data[len - 1]` when `len` is 0. While this could cause the tool to access `data[-1]`, this is: - Limited to userspace tool crashes or undefined behavior - Not a kernel security vulnerability - Not exploitable for privilege escalation or kernel compromise 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" (like Similar Commit 3 and 5) involve kernel-level security issues: - Similar Commit 3: Kernel netlink validation bypass leading to uninitalized memory reads - Similar Commit 5: Kernel team driver string validation bypass Meanwhile, commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" involve userspace tools or non-security fixes, which aligns with this commit. 4. **Impact assessment**: This is a defensive programming fix to prevent undefined behavior in a userspace tool, not a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability that could compromise system security. The fix prevents a potential crash or undefined behavior in the YNL userspace library when processing malformed netlink attributes with zero length, but this does not constitute a security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
250cf3693060a __legitimize_mnt(): check for MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT should be under mount_lock
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Impact Analysis: **1. Race Condition in Critical Code Path:** The commit fixes a race condition in `__legitimize_mnt()` where the check for `MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT` was performed outside of `mount_lock`. This creates a window where: - A mount can be marked for synchronous umount (`MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT` set) - `__legitimize_mnt()` increments the reference count on that same mount - The unlocked check for `MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT` can miss the flag due to the race - This leads to incorrect reference counting as described in the commit message **2. Use-After-Free Risk:** The commit message specifically mentions that this race can result in "leaving dropping the reference to caller, where it'll be a full-blown mntput()." This incorrect reference counting can lead to: - Use-after-free when the mount structure is accessed after being freed - Memory corruption due to improper cleanup timing - Double-free scenarios in mount destruction **3. Security-Critical Subsystem:** This affects mount namespace operations, which are fundamental to Linux security boundaries including: - Container isolation - Chroot environments - Filesystem access control **4. Pattern Consistency:** Looking at the provided similar commits, this follows the same pattern as commits 2 and 3 (both assigned CVEs) which also fix race conditions in mount handling code that could lead to memory safety issues. The fix involves moving critical checks inside proper locking to prevent race conditions. **5. Code Evidence:** The fix moves the `MNT_SYNC_UMOUNT` check from outside `lock_mount_hash()` to inside it, combining it with the existing `MNT_DOOMED` check. This demonstrates the security-critical nature of these flags, which prevent access to mounts being destroyed. This is a memory safety vulnerability in core kernel infrastructure that could potentially be exploited to cause crashes or memory corruption.
bc7e097509356 btrfs: correct the order of prelim_ref arguments in btrfs__prelim_ref
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a simple argument order bug in a tracepoint declaration that was introduced in 2017 (commit 00142756e1f8). The bug swaps `newref` and `oldref` parameters in the TP_ARGS macro, which causes a NULL pointer dereference when the tracepoint is enabled. 2. **Trigger Conditions**: The crash only occurs when: - The specific tracepoint `btrfs_prelim_ref_insert` is manually enabled via debugfs - Certain filesystem operations (like fiemap/extent queries) are performed - This is essentially a debugging-only issue 3. **No Security Impact**: The NULL pointer dereference happens in tracing code and does not: - Expose sensitive information - Allow privilege escalation - Compromise data integrity - Affect normal filesystem operations when tracing is disabled 4. **Administrative Requirement**: Triggering this bug requires root privileges to enable the tracepoint via `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/btrfs/btrfs_prelim_ref_insert/enable`, making it not exploitable by unprivileged users. 5. **Similar Pattern Analysis**: Unlike the similar commits that were assigned CVEs (which involved NULL pointer dereferences in core filesystem functionality), this is purely a debugging/tracing infrastructure bug that doesn't affect normal operation. The fix simply corrects the argument order in line 1931 of `include/trace/events/btrfs.h` from `TP_ARGS(fs_info, newref, oldref, tree_size)` to `TP_ARGS(fs_info, oldref, newref, tree_size)` to match the function prototype.
6f9a8ab796c65 btrfs: compression: adjust cb->compressed_folios allocation type
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Impact**: This is purely a type correctness fix with no functional change. The commit message explicitly states "These are the same allocation size (pointer size), but the types don't match." Both `struct page *` and `struct folio *` are pointer types of identical size, so the allocation size remains exactly the same. 2. **No Vulnerability Fix**: The change from `sizeof(struct page *)` to `sizeof(struct folio *)` in the `kcalloc()` call is purely to match types for an upcoming compiler enhancement. No security issue is being addressed. 3. **Infrastructure/Preparatory Change**: This is part of a larger effort to make kmalloc() type-aware, as evidenced by the commit message mentioning "In preparation for making the kmalloc() family of allocators type aware." This is compiler infrastructure work, not a security fix. 4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at similar commits in the search results, there are many identical changes across different subsystems (fbdev, vhost, drm, etc.) all with the same pattern - adjusting allocation types to match assignment types. None of these appear to be security-related. 5. **No Memory Safety Issue**: The original code was functionally correct - it allocated the right amount of memory, it just had a type mismatch that would become problematic with future compiler enhancements. There was no buffer overflow, memory corruption, or other memory safety issue. 6. **Reference Context**: Comparing to the historical similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also a helper function addition for type safety - Similar Commits 2&3 (YES CVE): Fixed actual race conditions and memory corruption issues - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Infrastructure change for kmalloc bucket optimization - Similar Commit 5 (YES CVE): Fixed an actual bug causing assertion failures This commit aligns with the pattern of infrastructure/type-safety changes that don't warrant CVEs, rather than actual vulnerability fixes.
4551383e78d59 iio: imu: st_lsm6dsx: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the comparison commits to understand the pattern: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Type of Issue**: This is a **resource management bug**, not a security vulnerability. The commit changes from `device_init_wakeup(dev, true)` to `devm_device_init_wakeup(dev)` to ensure proper cleanup when the device is unbound. 2. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar commits 1 and 3 (gpio drivers with identical wakeup source leak fixes) are marked as **CVE Status: NO** - This indicates that wakeup source leaks are classified as resource management issues, not security vulnerabilities 3. **Security Impact**: The "leak" here refers to memory allocated for wakeup source management that isn't properly cleaned up on device unbind. This: - Does not expose sensitive data - Does not allow privilege escalation - Does not create exploitable conditions - Is purely a resource cleanup issue 4. **Code Analysis**: The fix uses `devm_device_init_wakeup()` which automatically registers a cleanup function (`device_disable_wakeup`) that will be called when the device is removed, ensuring proper resource cleanup. This is standard resource management, not security-critical. 5. **Impact Scope**: The issue only affects proper cleanup during device unbind operations, which is typically an administrative operation and doesn't create attack vectors. This follows the same pattern as the gpio wakeup source leak fixes which were correctly classified as non-security issues.
0cd34d98dfd4f iio: accel: fxls8962af: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the issue:** This is a resource management improvement, not a security vulnerability. The commit changes from `device_init_wakeup(dev, true)` to `devm_device_init_wakeup(dev)` to use the managed version that automatically cleans up wakeup source memory when the device is unbound. **Comparing to historical examples:** 1. **Similar commits marked NO CVE:** The provided similar commits (gpio mpc8xxx and gpio zynq wakeup source leaks) show the exact same pattern - switching to `devm_device_init_wakeup()` - and were marked as NOT requiring CVEs. 2. **Memory leak commits marked YES CVE:** The commits that received CVEs (like the IIO ADC at91_adc, kxcjk-1013, and vfio examples) involved different types of memory leaks: - Missing `iio_trigger_free()` calls on error paths - Missing `iio_triggered_buffer_cleanup()` calls - Failure to free allocated names/contexts on error **Key differences:** - The wakeup source "leak" here is automatically cleaned up when the device is removed from the system, unlike the CVE cases where memory was permanently lost - This is a resource management optimization rather than a fix for memory that would never be reclaimed - The commit pattern exactly matches the non-CVE examples in the similar commits section **Impact assessment:** This fix prevents minor resource waste during device unbind operations but does not create persistent memory leaks or security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
ad3764b45c152 iio: adc: qcom-spmi-iadc: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Type of Issue**: This is a resource management fix, specifically a memory leak related to wakeup source cleanup. The commit changes `device_init_wakeup(iadc->dev, 1)` to `devm_device_init_wakeup(iadc->dev)` to ensure proper cleanup when the device is unbound. 2. **Pattern Match with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits: - Similar commits 1 and 2 (gpio: mpc8xxx and gpio: zynq) with "CVE Status: NO" fix identical wakeup source leak issues - Similar commits 3 and 4 with "CVE Status: YES" fix different types of resource leaks (trigger reference leaks and ioremap leaks) that have more direct security implications 3. **Security Impact Analysis**: - The wakeup source memory leak occurs only during device unbind operations - This is not a runtime vulnerability that can be exploited during normal operation - The leak doesn't affect system security boundaries, access controls, or data integrity - No potential for privilege escalation, buffer overflows, or other security-critical issues 4. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits**: The commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" involve: - Resource leaks that can cause system instability (trigger reference counting issues) - Missing cleanup that leaves system resources in inconsistent states - This wakeup source leak is much more limited in scope and impact 5. **Code Change Analysis**: The fix simply switches to a managed resource API (`devm_device_init_wakeup`) that automatically handles cleanup, which is a standard Linux kernel resource management pattern. This is a quality improvement and resource management fix, but not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
d5463e531c128 ASoC: intel/sdw_utils: Add volume limit to cs35l56 speakers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This commit adds volume limiting functionality to prevent audio distortion, not fix a security vulnerability. The code adds calls to `snd_soc_limit_volume()` to cap the maximum volume at 0dB (400) instead of allowing it to reach +12dB or higher. 2. **Audio quality vs security**: The commit message clearly states this is about preventing "distorted audio" rather than addressing any security concerns. Audio distortion is a quality/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 & 2 (CVE Status: NO) are also volume limiting changes for cs35l56, focusing on audio quality - Similar Commit 3 (CVE Status: YES) was fixing an actual bounds check vulnerability that could lead to out-of-bounds access - Similar Commits 4 & 5 (CVE Status: NO) were correcting mask calculations but not security issues 4. **Code analysis**: The changes add protective limits using the standard `snd_soc_limit_volume()` API. This is a defensive improvement to prevent poor audio quality, not a fix for a exploitable vulnerability. 5. **No security implications**: There's no indication that excessive volume levels could be exploited for anything beyond audio distortion. This is not a buffer overflow, access control bypass, or any other security-relevant pattern. The commit is a quality improvement to prevent audio distortion in specific driver configurations, not a security fix.
f122121796f91 cifs: Fix changing times and read-only attr over SMB1 smb_set_file_info() function
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, considering the historical similar commits that were marked as "NO" for CVE status: **NO** This commit fixes functionality issues with SMB1 client operations on non-NT servers rather than addressing a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security**: The commit addresses broken functionality (`touch` command failing, `chmod +w`/`chmod -w` not working) rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited. 2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The changes implement proper fallback mechanisms and protocol compatibility but don't fix issues where security boundaries could be bypassed or where unauthorized access could occur. 3. **Similar Pattern to "NO" Examples**: This follows the same pattern as the provided similar commits that were marked "NO" - it's primarily about correctness and compatibility with SMB protocol implementations rather than fixing exploitable security flaws. 4. **Limited Attack Surface**: While the commit mentions compatibility with legacy servers, the changes are about making legitimate operations work correctly, not preventing malicious exploitation. 5. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The fixes don't address scenarios where an attacker could gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data they shouldn't have access to. The commit improves the robustness and correctness of SMB1 client operations but doesn't fix a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
0759e77a6d9bd ALSA: usb-audio: Fix duplicated name in MIDI substream names
- [sasha] Now I can analyze the security implications. Let me examine the original code behavior before the fix: Based on my analysis: **CVE Status: NO** This commit fixes a cosmetic/usability issue, not a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning: 1. **No Buffer Overflow**: The fix doesn't address any buffer overflow or memory safety issue. The original `snprintf` call was already using `sizeof(substream->name)` to limit output to 32 characters, which properly prevents buffer overflows. 2. **String Duplication Issue**: The problem being fixed is purely cosmetic - when USB device manufacturers put the same product name in both the iProduct field (which becomes `card->shortname`) and the iJack field (`jack_name`), the resulting MIDI substream name becomes redundant like "Launchkey MK4 49 Launchkey MK4 49 MIDI In". 3. **Fix Logic**: The patch adds a string comparison check `strncmp(umidi->card->shortname, jack_name, strlen(umidi->card->shortname))` to detect when the jack name starts with the same text as the card shortname. If they match, it uses only the `jack_name` via `strscpy(substream->name, jack_name)` instead of concatenating both. 4. **No Security Impact**: - No privilege escalation possible - No information disclosure (if anything, it reduces redundant info display) - No denial of service potential - No access control bypass - No memory corruption 5. **Similar Historical Context**: Looking at the provided similar commits, commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved actual memory leaks and uninitialized memory exposure, while "CVE Status: NO" commits involved naming/labeling fixes similar to this one. The commit message explicitly states this is to resolve "duplicated name" display issues for better user experience, not to fix any security vulnerability.
ab35ad950d439 nvme-pci: add quirks for WDC Blue SN550 15b7:5009
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code: **NO** This commit adds hardware-specific quirks for the WDC Blue SN550 NVMe drive and does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Hardware compatibility fix**: The commit adds two quirks (NVME_QUIRK_BROKEN_MSI and NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS) that work around hardware-specific issues, not security flaws. 2. **Non-security impacts**: - NVME_QUIRK_BROKEN_MSI disables broken MSI interrupts that cause timeouts and boot delays - NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS prevents entering a problematic power state that causes system hangs 3. **Pattern consistency**: All 5 similar commits provided as reference (adding NVMe quirks) were marked "CVE Status: NO", and this follows the exact same pattern. 4. **Code analysis**: The changes only add a device entry to drivers/nvme/host/pci.c quirks table. Looking at the kernel code, these quirks: - BROKEN_MSI simply removes `PCI_IRQ_MSI` from interrupt allocation flags at pci.c:2440 and 2707 - NO_DEEPEST_PS prevents transitions to the deepest power state at core.c:2732 5. **No security implications**: The commit message describes functional problems (timeouts, boot issues, responsiveness) with no mention of security concerns. The issues being fixed are hardware reliability problems, not exploitable vulnerabilities. This is purely a hardware compatibility workaround, not a security fix.
5b960f92ac3e5 nvme-pci: add quirks for device 126f:1001
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the security implications of the NVMe quirks being added, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Commit Analysis:** 1. **Hardware Compatibility Fix**: This commit adds device-specific quirks (NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS and NVME_QUIRK_IGNORE_DEV_SUBNQN) for Silicon Motion device 126f:1001, similar to the existing 126f:2262 entry. 2. **Defensive Security Measure**: The quirks actually **improve** system security and stability by: - Preventing device lockups when entering deep power states that could cause data loss - Working around invalid SUBNQN field issues that could cause device identification problems - Avoiding system hangs that require ungraceful shutdowns 3. **No New Vulnerabilities**: The commit doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities - it addresses existing hardware firmware bugs that could otherwise cause: - Device unresponsiveness - System instability - Potential data integrity issues 4. **Pattern Consistency**: All similar commits in the historical examples (adding NVMe quirks for device compatibility) are marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of hardware compatibility fix doesn't warrant CVE assignment. 5. **Root Cause**: The underlying issues are in the device firmware (Silicon Motion controller), not in the kernel code. The kernel is implementing workarounds for known hardware limitations. **Conclusion**: This is a hardware compatibility fix that improves system stability and data integrity rather than fixing a security vulnerability. No CVE is warranted.
be0c40da88884 ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for HP Spectre x360 15-df1xxx
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit carefully. Looking at the code changes and comparing them to the similar commits: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit adds a device-specific quirk for the HP Spectre x360 15-df1xxx laptop to enable audio functionality, specifically mute LED and speaker amplifier setup. Here's why it doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **Nature of Change**: This is purely a hardware compatibility fix that adds support for a specific laptop model's audio features. The commit adds: - A new quirk function `alc285_fixup_hp_spectre_x360_df1()` - GPIO configuration for speaker amplifiers - Pin configuration setup - Mute LED enablement 2. **No Security Implications**: The changes involve: - Hardware-specific GPIO pin configurations (`spec->gpio_mask |= 0x01`) - Audio routing setup (`snd_hda_override_conn_list()`) - LED control functionality (`alc285_fixup_hp_mute_led_coefbit()`) - None of these operations present security vulnerabilities 3. **Pattern Consistency**: This follows the exact same pattern as all the similar commits provided (all marked as "CVE Status: NO"), which also add hardware quirks for HP laptops. The code structure is nearly identical to existing functions like `alc285_fixup_hp_spectre_x360_eb1()`. 4. **Functionality Enhancement**: The commit enables previously non-functional hardware features (mute LED, speaker amplification) rather than fixing a security flaw or preventing malicious behavior. 5. **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Issues**: The changes don't modify access controls, input validation, memory management, or any security-sensitive code paths. This is a standard hardware enablement patch that adds device-specific audio configuration, not a security fix.
a549b927ea3f5 ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add DMI quirk for Acer Aspire SW3-013
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a hardware compatibility quirk addition for audio functionality on a specific laptop model (Acer Aspire SW3-013). It adds DMI (Desktop Management Interface) matching and audio configuration flags to make the audio subsystem work correctly on this hardware. 2. **No security implications**: The code changes only add configuration flags that control: - DMIC (Digital Microphone) mapping - Jack detection source - Over-current detection thresholds - Differential microphone settings - Audio interface selection - Master clock enable 3. **Similar to reference commits**: All the provided similar commits (Similar Commits 1-5) are also DMI quirk additions for audio hardware compatibility and are marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the exact same pattern. 4. **Hardware-specific functionality**: The quirk only affects one specific hardware model and configures audio hardware parameters. There are no changes to security-sensitive code paths, memory management, access controls, or input validation. 5. **No vulnerability fix**: The commit message and linked bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220011) indicate this is purely about making audio functionality work on this laptop model, not fixing any security issue. This is a standard hardware compatibility fix with no security implications whatsoever.
70ad2e6bd180f ASoC: cs42l43: Disable headphone clamps during type detection
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit addresses an audio quality issue (loud pops during headphone type detection), not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Changes Are Benign**: The changes only temporarily disable and re-enable headphone clamps during detection to improve audio experience. There are no changes related to: - Memory management or buffer handling - Input validation or bounds checking - Access control or privilege management - Race conditions or concurrency issues 3. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All 5 provided similar commits dealing with cs42l43 and other audio codec improvements are marked "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern of audio hardware functionality improvements. 4. **No Security Context**: The commit message contains no security-related language and describes purely functional audio improvements. 5. **Hardware-Specific Audio Enhancement**: This is a vendor-specific audio codec driver improvement to reduce audio artifacts, which falls into the category of quality-of-life enhancements rather than security fixes.
02c6e43397c39 platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: add support for some new buttons
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a feature addition that adds support for new hardware buttons on IdeaPad laptops. Analysis shows: 1. **Feature Addition, Not Security Fix**: The commit adds new key mappings (0x44, 0x45, 0x3d, 0x2d, 0x29, 0x2a) for previously unsupported buttons like "Star", "Eye", "Performance toggle", "shift + prtsc", "touchpad toggle", and "root menu". 2. **Functionality Enhancement**: The new code adds a check for WMI code 0x3d to trigger `platform_profile_cycle()`, which is a legitimate API function designed to cycle between platform performance profiles. 3. **No Security Implications**: The changes only map hardware button presses to standard Linux input key codes (KEY_PROG1, KEY_PROG3, KEY_PROG4, KEY_CUT, KEY_TOUCHPAD_TOGGLE, KEY_ROOT_MENU) and call an existing platform profile cycling function. 4. **Similar Pattern**: All the similar commits shown (adding support for new Acer/IdeaPad models and buttons) are marked as "CVE Status: NO", confirming this type of hardware support addition doesn't constitute a security vulnerability. 5. **No Dangerous Operations**: The code doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, or any other security-relevant patterns. This is purely a hardware enablement feature that allows previously non-functional buttons to work properly on newer IdeaPad models.
e56088a137087 pinctrl: meson: define the pull up/down resistor value as 60 kOhm
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a security assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit only changes a return value from `arg = 1` to `arg = 60000` in the `meson_pinconf_get()` function for bias pull-up/pull-down configuration queries. 2. **Purpose**: This is purely a cosmetic/informational improvement. The commit message clearly states this change is "so it's shown in the debugfs output" with a more accurate resistor value (60 kOhm instead of the placeholder value of 1 Ohm). 3. **No Functional Impact**: - The change only affects the reported value when querying pin bias configuration - It doesn't change any hardware behavior or control logic - It doesn't fix any incorrect hardware programming - No security-sensitive operations are involved 4. **Context from Similar Commits**: All the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - they are configuration improvements, typo fixes, or compatibility enhancements without security implications. This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **No Security-Relevant Code Patterns**: The change doesn't involve: - Buffer overflow fixes - Access control changes - Input validation improvements - Memory management fixes - Privilege escalation fixes This is simply a documentation/reporting accuracy improvement with no security implications.
29bdc1f1c1df8 book3s64/radix: Fix compile errors when CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_DAX_VMEMMAP=n
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is purely a compilation fix that adds conditional compilation guards (`#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_DAX_VMEMMAP` and `#endif`) around the `vmemmap_can_optimize` function. This function was being compiled unconditionally but should only exist when the `CONFIG_ARCH_WANT_OPTIMIZE_DAX_VMEMMAP` configuration option is enabled. The commit: 1. **Fixes only compilation errors** - not runtime vulnerabilities 2. **Does not change runtime behavior** - when the config is enabled, the function works exactly as before 3. **Does not fix any security-related bugs** - no memory corruption, access control, or other security issues 4. **Follows the pattern of similar non-CVE commits** - like the missing semicolon fix in Similar Commit 2 This is a standard build system fix that ensures proper conditional compilation, similar to many other compilation fixes that do not warrant CVE assignment.
a9a69c3b38c89 ASoC: imx-card: Adjust over allocation of memory in imx_card_parse_of()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the relevant structures, I can now provide my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** This commit corrects an over-allocation bug where the wrong structure size was being used in a `devm_kcalloc()` call. The code was using `sizeof(*link)` (which refers to `struct snd_soc_dai_link`) instead of `sizeof(*link_data)` (which refers to `struct dai_link_data`). Key observations: 1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a memory over-allocation issue, not an under-allocation that could lead to buffer overflows 2. **Structure size comparison**: - `struct dai_link_data` contains: 3 unsigned int fields + 1 bool = ~13-16 bytes - `struct snd_soc_dai_link` is a much larger structure with many pointers, arrays, and complex fields = likely 100+ bytes 3. **Security implications**: Over-allocation wastes memory but does not create security vulnerabilities. The allocated memory is properly managed by the kernel's devm API and will be cleaned up automatically 4. **Impact**: This is a resource waste issue, not a security issue. The code would work correctly with the over-allocation, just using more memory than necessary Similar reference commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved NULL pointer dereference prevention and buffer overflow fixes, which are clear security issues. This commit, however, only fixes inefficient memory usage without any security implications.
75bc3dab4e49b net-sysfs: restore behavior for not running devices
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Analysis of the commit:** 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a behavioral regression fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's restoring the "old behavior" for sysfs attributes when devices are not running. 2. **What the bug was**: After the blamed commit (79c61899b5ee), reading sysfs attributes like `/sys/class/net/dummy0/carrier` on non-running devices would return an empty string instead of the expected "Invalid argument" error (-EINVAL). 3. **Code changes**: The fix simply adds `ret = -EINVAL;` assignments in three functions (`carrier_show`, `speed_show`, `duplex_show`) to ensure proper error handling when devices are not running. This restores the original error return behavior. 4. **Security implications**: None. This is purely about API consistency and proper error reporting. There's no: - Memory corruption potential - Access control bypass - Information disclosure - DoS potential - Privilege escalation 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the historical examples, commits that get CVEs typically involve race conditions leading to kernel crashes (like the net-sysfs speed_show NULL pointer dereference), infinite loops causing lockups (like the openvswitch commits), or data races with security implications (like the netrom sysctl commit). This commit fixes none of these security-relevant issues. This is a straightforward API behavior fix to maintain backward compatibility, not a security vulnerability.
02b44a2b2bdce ASoC: intel/sdw_utils: Add volume limit to cs42l43 speakers
- [sasha] Let me also examine the similar commits that were marked "NO" for CVE to understand the pattern: **Analysis:** This commit adds a volume limit to prevent audio distortion by capping the CS42L43 speaker volume at 0dB (128) instead of the hardware maximum of +31.5dB. **Key observations:** 1. **Not a security fix**: The commit addresses audio quality (distortion prevention), not a security vulnerability 2. **No privileged access control**: The change limits volume to prevent distortion, not to prevent unauthorized access 3. **Similar pattern to non-CVE commits**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 1-3, which were all volume limit adjustments for audio quality and marked "CVE Status: NO" 4. **Hardware limitation enforcement**: Like the other non-CVE commits, this enforces hardware/quality limits rather than fixing security flaws 5. **No user input validation issues**: Unlike Similar Commits 4-5 (marked YES), this doesn't fix input validation or bounds checking vulnerabilities **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits:** - Similar Commit 4: Fixed array bounds checking (security issue) - Similar Commit 5: Fixed control value range validation (security issue) This commit only adds a quality-of-life audio improvement and follows the exact pattern of multiple similar commits that were correctly marked as not requiring CVEs. **NO** This commit adds a volume limit to prevent audio distortion, not to fix a security vulnerability. It follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 1-3 which were correctly marked "CVE Status: NO" - all involve setting volume limits for audio quality reasons rather than fixing security issues like the bounds checking problems in Similar Commits 4-5.
355341e4359b2 loop: don't require ->write_iter for writable files in loop_configure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel source code: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not fixing a security vulnerability**: This commit removes an overly restrictive check that was causing legitimate operations to fail. It's fixing a functional regression, not a security issue. 2. **Proper security checks remain intact**: The commit removes the check `(mode & BLK_OPEN_WRITE) && !file->f_op->write_iter` from `loop_configure()` but keeps the proper security check in `loop_check_backing_file()` which validates `(file->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE) && !file->f_op->write_iter`. The latter is the correct check that ensures files opened for actual writing have the required write_iter function. 3. **Restoring historic behavior**: The commit message explicitly states this change allows block devices to be "opened read-write even if they can't be written to for historic reasons" - this is restoring legitimate functionality, not fixing improper access. 4. **Different from CVE-worthy examples**: Unlike Similar Commits 2 & 5 (which got CVEs for preventing directory writes in ksmbd), this commit relaxes a check rather than tightening security to prevent unauthorized access. 5. **No new attack vectors**: The change doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities or fix existing ones - it simply removes an overly strict validation that broke legitimate use cases. The code change at `drivers/block/loop.c:982-984` removes a redundant check while maintaining the proper security validation through `loop_check_backing_file()`.
af5226abb40ca smb: server: smb2pdu: check return value of xa_store()
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. The fix addresses a missing error check for `xa_store()` in the SMB server's session authentication path, specifically in the `ntlm_authenticate()` function at `fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c:1565`. **Security Impact Analysis:** 1. **Memory Management Vulnerability**: The original code calls `xa_store()` without checking its return value. If `xa_store()` fails (returning an error pointer), the code continues execution assuming success, leading to: - Memory leak of the allocated `chann` structure - Potential use of invalid state in the session's channel list 2. **Session Management Critical Path**: This occurs during SMB session authentication (`ntlm_authenticate`), which is a security-critical operation. Failures here could potentially be exploited to: - Cause memory exhaustion through repeated failed allocations - Leave the session in an inconsistent state - Potentially bypass security checks if session state becomes corrupted 3. **Pattern Consistency**: This fix follows the exact same pattern as Similar Commits 1 and 2 (both marked CVE Status: YES), which also fixed missing `xa_store()` error checks in ksmbd. The fix adds proper error handling by checking `xa_is_err(old)` and freeing allocated memory on failure. 4. **SMB Server Context**: The ksmbd SMB server handles network file sharing and authentication, making reliability and security paramount. Resource management failures in authentication paths are particularly concerning. The commit properly addresses a resource management vulnerability in a security-critical authentication path, making it worthy of CVE assignment.
4465f4fa21e0e HID: Kconfig: Add LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR dependency to HID_LOGITECH
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit to understand what this is fixing: **NO** This commit is not a security vulnerability fix - it's a build dependency fix. Here's the analysis: 1. **Root Cause**: The commit references the Fixes commit `a3a064146c50` which converted the hid-lg-g15 driver to use the standard multicolor LED API instead of a custom sysfs attribute. 2. **The Problem**: After that conversion, the driver now calls multicolor LED functions like: - `led_mc_calc_color_components()` - `devm_led_classdev_multicolor_register_ext()` But the Kconfig for HID_LOGITECH only depended on `LEDS_CLASS`, not `LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR`. 3. **Build Failure**: When `LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR` is not enabled, these multicolor LED functions are undefined, causing linker errors. 4. **The Fix**: Adding `depends on LEDS_CLASS_MULTICOLOR` to the HID_LOGITECH Kconfig ensures the required multicolor LED subsystem is built when the Logitech HID driver is selected. This is purely a build system configuration fix to resolve missing dependencies introduced by an API migration. There are no security implications - it's just ensuring that all required LED framework components are available when building the driver that now uses them. The error messages show classic undefined reference linker errors, not security vulnerabilities. The similar commits provided (all marked CVE Status: NO) also show non-security LED/documentation fixes, supporting this assessment.
7af8479d9eb43 Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix not checking l2cap_chan security level
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this commit: **CVE ANALYSIS:** **NO** This commit fixes an incorrect implementation detail but does not address a significant security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **Reasoning:** 1. **Fix Type**: The commit changes `l2cap_check_enc_key_size(hcon)` to `l2cap_check_enc_key_size(hcon, chan)` and modifies the function to check `chan->sec_level` instead of `hcon->sec_level` for FIPS-level encryption requirements. 2. **Security Impact Analysis**: - The original code used the connection's security level (`hcon->sec_level`) to determine if 16-byte encryption keys were required - The fix uses the channel's security level (`chan->sec_level`) instead - This is primarily a **correctness fix** for proper security level enforcement rather than closing a major security hole 3. **Limited Exploitability**: - The vulnerability would only manifest when `hcon->sec_level != chan->sec_level` - It affects FIPS-level security enforcement specifically (BT_SECURITY_FIPS) - The impact is incorrect key size validation, not a complete bypass of security mechanisms 4. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commit**: Looking at "Similar Commit 4" which received a CVE, that was for a u8 overflow that could be exploited by sending malformed packets. This current fix is more about using the correct security level reference. 5. **Context from similar commits**: The provided examples show that L2CAP security improvements and encryption key size fixes typically do **not** receive CVEs unless they represent clear exploitable vulnerabilities with significant impact. The fix ensures that channels requiring FIPS-level security properly enforce 16-byte encryption keys based on the channel's security requirements rather than the connection's negotiated level, but this represents a specification compliance fix rather than a critical security vulnerability.
77bdac73754e4 platform/x86: asus-wmi: Disable OOBE state after resume from hibernation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Analysis **1. Nature of the Fix:** The commit addresses a functional issue where ASUS firmware resets the OOBE (Out-Of-Box-Experience) state during S4 suspend (hibernation), causing keyboard backlight to blink after resume. This is primarily a **user experience issue**, not a security vulnerability. **2. Code Changes Analysis:** - Adds `oobe_state_available` field for better state tracking - Modifies `asus_hotk_restore()` to disable OOBE state after hibernation resume - The OOBE control affects hardware features like keyboard backlight, not security-critical functions **3. No Security Implications:** - **No privilege escalation**: The changes don't affect access controls or privilege boundaries - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or similar vulnerabilities - **No race conditions**: The caching of OOBE state availability is for efficiency, not security - **No input validation problems**: The fix uses existing, safe WMI device state APIs - **No cryptographic issues**: OOBE state controls hardware features, not security mechanisms **4. Comparison with Similar Commits:** Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this follows the same pattern: - Hardware feature enablement/configuration fixes - Power management related changes - Driver functionality improvements - No security vulnerabilities addressed **5. OOBE Context:** From the kernel tree analysis, OOBE primarily controls user-visible hardware features (keyboard backlight, etc.) rather than security-critical functions. The device ID is grouped with display/LED controls, not security mechanisms. This is a **functional fix** to ensure consistent hardware behavior after hibernation resume, not a security vulnerability fix.
10e08943caedf drm/amdkfd: Fix pasid value leak
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific security implications by understanding what this commit does: Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from similar commits marked with CVE status, I can now make a determination. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a resource management fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses a PASID (Process Address Space Identifier) value leak that occurs due to improper ownership transfer between the KFD (Kernel Fusion Driver) and graphics driver components. 2. **No security impact**: The changes show: - Removal of `amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm_release_process_vm()` function calls - Removal of `amdgpu_vm_release_compute()` function - Removal of function declarations from headers These changes prevent the KFD driver from trying to release PASID values that are actually owned and managed by the graphics driver, avoiding double-free scenarios. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits: - **Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE)**: Simple logging changes with no security impact - **Similar Commits 2-5 (YES CVE)**: All involved memory leaks that could lead to resource exhaustion, use-after-free, or other exploitable conditions 4. **Root cause analysis**: The commit message clearly states this fixes an architectural issue introduced by commit 8544374c0f82 where KFD started using PASID values from the graphics driver instead of allocating its own. The fix prevents KFD from incorrectly trying to release resources it doesn't own. 5. **No exploitation potential**: This is a cleanup/correctness fix that prevents improper resource management, but doesn't introduce or fix any condition that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service attacks. The commit prevents resource management conflicts between driver components rather than fixing an exploitable security vulnerability.
129860044c611 wifi: mac80211: Add counter for all monitor interfaces
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Nature of the Issue This is a **functional bug fix** rather than a security vulnerability. The commit introduces a new `virt_monitors` counter to properly distinguish between virtual monitor interfaces and all monitor interfaces, fixing incorrect counting logic. ## Security Analysis **No Security Impact:** 1. **No privilege escalation**: The bug doesn't allow unprivileged access or escalation 2. **No memory corruption**: This is purely a counter management issue, no buffer overflows or memory safety issues 3. **No information disclosure**: The bug prevents monitor interfaces from working correctly rather than causing inappropriate information leakage 4. **Limited attack surface**: Monitor interfaces require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` privileges to create ## Functional Impact Only The bug was causing **monitor packet mirroring to fail** when using `MONITOR_FLAG_ACTIVE` or `NO_VIRTUAL_MONITOR` interfaces. This affects: - Network monitoring tools functionality - Packet capture capabilities - Network debugging/troubleshooting But it doesn't create exploitable security conditions. ## Comparison to Similar Commits This aligns with similar commits 1-4 (all marked "CVE Status: NO") which are functional WiFi/monitor interface fixes. The one "CVE Status: YES" commit (commit 5) was different - it prevented kernel warnings that could be maliciously triggered, representing a potential stability/DoS issue. This commit fixes a functional regression that prevents legitimate monitoring features from working correctly, making it a quality-of-life improvement rather than a security fix.
81100b9a7b051 serial: sh-sci: Save and restore more registers
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. The issue causes system lock-up during resume operations on specific Renesas hardware when firmware uses different serial speed configuration methods than Linux. While this can result in system unavailability, it: 1. **Limited attack surface**: Only affects specific hardware configurations during legitimate power management operations 2. **Requires privileged access**: Suspend/resume operations typically require appropriate system privileges 3. **No persistent security impact**: The lock-up doesn't enable privilege escalation, data disclosure, or persist across hard reboot 4. **Timing/configuration issue**: The root cause is inadequate register state preservation during driver resume, not a security design flaw The code changes add saving/restoring of additional registers (SCDL, SCCKS, HSSRR, SCPCR, SCPDR) to prevent configuration mismatches that cause the lock-up. This is a driver reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
54580ccdd8a9c ipv6: remove leftover ip6 cookie initializer
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The analysis shows this is purely a dead code removal with no security implications. **Reasoning:** 1. **Dead Code Removal**: The removed check `if (ipc6->dontfrag < 0)` is unreachable because `ipcm6_init_sk()` now always initializes `dontfrag` to either 0 or 1 (via `inet6_test_bit(DONTFRAG, sk)`), never -1. 2. **No Functional Change**: Since the condition can never be true, removing it doesn't alter the runtime behavior or security properties of the IPv6 fragmentation handling. 3. **Code Quality Improvement**: This represents a legitimate cleanup completing the refactoring started in commit 096208592b09, eliminating confusion for future maintainers. 4. **No Security Impact**: The change doesn't affect access control, resource management, information disclosure, or introduce any attack vectors. The actual fragmentation logic and socket option behavior remain completely unchanged. This is similar to Similar Commit 4 (data race annotations) which also received "NO" - both are code quality improvements without security implications.
c488967488d7e drm/amd/display: Exit idle optimizations before accessing PHY
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on analysis of the code changes and kernel context, this is a functional bug fix addressing hardware power state management, not a security vulnerability. **Key Evidence:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds calls to `clk_mgr_exit_optimized_pwr_state()` and `clk_mgr_optimize_pwr_state()` around hardware operations to ensure PHY registers are accessible before being accessed. 2. **Root cause**: The issue occurs when hardware is in "idle optimized state" which blocks access to PHY registers, potentially causing DMUB (Display Microcontroller Unit Block) hangs. 3. **No security boundary violation**: This occurs within legitimate kernel driver code that already has appropriate permissions for hardware register access. 4. **Functional vs security impact**: While the original issue could cause system hangs (a form of DoS), this is a hardware sequencing problem rather than a security boundary violation. The hang results from improper initialization order, not unauthorized access attempts. 5. **Context from similar commits**: All 5 similar commits in the reference examples were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar AMD display power optimization issues, confirming this is a standard functional fix pattern. 6. **Scope limitation**: The fix only applies when not taking control from VBIOS (`!dcb->funcs->is_accelerated_mode(dcb)`), indicating it's about proper hardware handoff sequencing rather than security controls. This represents a standard hardware driver reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
183a08715af14 virtgpu: don't reset on shutdown
- [sasha] ### 5. Comparison with Similar Commits Looking at the provided examples: - **CVE Status: YES** commits fix actual vulnerabilities (null pointer dereference, call trace/hang during removal) - **CVE Status: NO** commits are functional improvements/optimizations without security implications This commit is clearly in the "NO" category - it's a functional fix for shutdown hangs, not a security vulnerability. ## Conclusion **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: It addresses functional shutdown hangs, not a security issue 2. **No exploitation scenario**: The commit doesn't fix memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities 3. **Actually reduces security**: It allows bypassing protective shutdown sequences designed to prevent device issues 4. **Functional optimization**: The change prioritizes system stability during shutdown over strict device isolation 5. **No security context in commit message**: Unlike CVE-worthy commits, there's no mention of security implications, just functional problems The commit fixes a legitimate functional issue where virtio GPU devices cause system hangs during shutdown, but this is not a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
0c7e053448945 drm/amdkfd: Correct F8_MODE for gfx950
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the security implications: ## Analysis **NO** This commit corrects a configuration error that was inadvertently introduced during a refactoring, but it does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment. **Explanation:** 1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is in the F8_MODE setting for gfx950 (IP_VERSION 9.5.0). The original commit 61972cd93af7 moved code from `update_qpd_v9()` to `set_cache_memory_policy_v9()` for optimization purposes, but incorrectly included gfx950 in the F8_MODE setting when it should have been excluded (as shown by commit 59228c6631f9 which previously removed gfx950 from this condition). 2. **What F8_MODE controls**: Based on the commit messages, F8_MODE appears to control floating-point format behavior (IEEE vs non-IEEE/OCP format). This is a computational mode setting, not a security-relevant configuration. 3. **Impact assessment**: - This affects floating-point computation behavior on gfx950 GPUs - It's a correctness issue for specific GPU computations, not a security vulnerability - There's no indication this could lead to privilege escalation, memory corruption, information disclosure, or other security issues 4. **Pattern comparison**: Reviewing the similar commits provided, all are marked "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar GPU driver configuration and optimization changes without security implications. 5. **Code change scope**: The fix is a simple condition modification in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_device_queue_manager_v9.c:74` that removes `KFD_GC_VERSION(dqm->dev->kfd) == IP_VERSION(9, 5, 0)` from the condition that sets F8_MODE, restoring the intended behavior for gfx950. This is a straightforward bug fix for GPU driver functionality rather than a security issue requiring CVE assignment.
48a136639ec23 watchdog: aspeed: fix 64-bit division
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the problem: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis **Issue Type**: Build failure due to 64-bit division on 32-bit architectures **The Problem**: The original code introduced in commit 5c03f9f4d362 had this line: ```c idx = ((intptr_t)wdt->base & 0x00000fff) / resource_size(res); ``` On 32-bit architectures, `resource_size_t` is defined as `phys_addr_t`, which can be 64-bit even on 32-bit systems. When the compiler generates code for 64-bit division on 32-bit platforms, it requires library functions like `__aeabi_uldivmod` that may not be available, causing a build failure. **The Fix**: The fix casts `resource_size(res)` to `uintptr_t`: ```c idx = ((intptr_t)wdt->base & 0x00000fff) / (uintptr_t)resource_size(res); ``` **Security Analysis**: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is purely a compilation issue, not a runtime security flaw 2. **No Exploitable Condition**: The build failure prevents the code from running at all - there's no exploitable code path 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The fix doesn't change the runtime behavior, only ensures compilation succeeds 4. **No Privilege Escalation**: This affects build-time compilation, not runtime security 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This matches the pattern of "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" which were marked as "NO" for CVE status **Context**: The calculation is used to determine the watchdog controller index for updating boot status registers. This is purely for hardware identification and status reporting, not security-critical functionality. **Conclusion**: This is a standard build fix for architectural compatibility, similar to many other 64-bit division fixes in the kernel. It resolves a compilation error without changing runtime behavior or introducing/fixing any security vulnerabilities.
012a6efcc8053 ASoC: sma1307: Fix error handling in sma1307_setting_loaded()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, code changes, and comparison with similar CVE-assigned commits, here's my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Double Free Vulnerability**: The primary issue is a classic double-free vulnerability where `kfree()` is called on memory allocated with `devm_kzalloc()`. This creates a memory management corruption issue where: - `devm_kzalloc()` allocates memory that is automatically freed by the device management framework - The error cleanup code incorrectly calls `kfree()` on this memory - This results in the memory being freed twice, leading to heap corruption 2. **Memory Leak**: The commit also fixes a memory leak where `data` was not freed on certain error paths, particularly when checksum validation fails. 3. **Security Impact**: Double-free vulnerabilities are well-established security issues that can: - Corrupt kernel heap metadata - Potentially lead to arbitrary code execution - Cause system instability and denial of service - Be exploited for privilege escalation 4. **Pattern Match with CVE Examples**: This commit closely matches the pattern of similar commits that received CVEs (like Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5), all of which involved memory management fixes with double-free or cleanup issues. 5. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability is in an audio codec driver that processes firmware files, which could potentially be exploited by malicious firmware or through crafted audio device interactions. The specific code changes show removal of incorrect `kfree()` calls on `devm_kzalloc()`-allocated memory (`sma1307->set.header`, `sma1307->set.def`) and proper cleanup of the `data` pointer using the `__free(kfree)` attribute. These are clear indicators of memory safety vulnerabilities being fixed.
5a062c3c3b820 pinctrl: tegra: Fix off by one in tegra_pinctrl_get_group()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a classic off-by-one error in bounds checking where `group_index > pmx->soc->ngroups` should be `group_index >= pmx->soc->ngroups` to prevent out-of-bounds array access. 2. **Exploitation Potential**: While this is technically a bounds check vulnerability, it has very limited exploitability: - The `group_index` comes from `tegra_pinctrl_get_group_index()` which iterates through valid groups (`0` to `pmx->soc->ngroups-1`) - The function returns `-EINVAL` if no match is found, meaning it typically returns valid indices within bounds - For the out-of-bounds access to occur, `group_index` would need to equal exactly `pmx->soc->ngroups`, which is unlikely in normal operation 3. **Impact Assessment**: - The function returns `NULL` when bounds are exceeded, and callers check for this NULL return - Both callers (`tegra_pinctrl_gpio_request_enable` and `tegra_pinctrl_gpio_disable_free`) properly handle NULL returns - This makes it a defensive bug fix rather than a critical security issue 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar Commit 1 (pinctrl: mediatek) with identical off-by-one pattern was marked "CVE Status: NO" - The impact and risk profile are very similar to that commit 5. **Context**: This is a defensive programming fix in kernel pinctrl subsystem with proper error handling already in place, making actual exploitation very difficult. The fix prevents a potential out-of-bounds read but the existing error handling already mitigates the practical security impact.
2b04d04de956b drm/amdkfd: Fix error handling for missing PASID in 'kfd_process_device_init_vm'
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Fix:** The change is a simple error code assignment (`ret = -EINVAL;`) when a PASID is missing during VM initialization. This addresses a static analysis warning about a missing error code rather than fixing an actual security vulnerability. **Code Analysis:** 1. **Error Path Behavior**: When `avm->pasid` is NULL, the code already properly goes to `err_get_pasid` label and performs appropriate cleanup 2. **Function Flow**: The function still returns an error value (likely uninitialized `ret`, but not a success value) and cleanup occurs correctly 3. **Caller Handling**: The calling function `kfd_ioctl_acquire_vm` would still detect the failure and handle it appropriately **Security Assessment:** - **No Memory Corruption**: The existing error path already performs proper cleanup through `kfd_process_device_destroy_cwsr_dgpu()` and `amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm_destroy_cb()` - **No Privilege Escalation**: The missing PASID condition is detected and handled, preventing VM initialization from completing - **No Information Disclosure**: Proper cleanup prevents uninitialized structures from being used **Comparison to CVE Examples:** Unlike the provided examples that fix actual null pointer dereferences and memory leaks, this commit only improves error code consistency without addressing a functional security flaw. **Conclusion:** This is a code quality improvement that ensures consistent error reporting, not a security vulnerability fix. The underlying functionality was already secure, just with inconsistent error code reporting.
749b5b279e563 drm/panel-edp: Add Starry 116KHD024006
- [sasha] Now let me understand what this commit is actually doing by looking at the exact change: Based on my analysis, this commit is simply **adding a new panel entry** to a lookup table for eDP (embedded DisplayPort) panels. Here's what it does: 1. **What the change does**: Adds a single line `EDP_PANEL_ENTRY('S', 'T', 'A', 0x0004, &delay_200_500_e200, "116KHD024006")` to the `edp_panels` array. 2. **What this means**: It adds support for a Starry 116KHD024006 panel with vendor ID "STA" and product ID 0x0004, associating it with specific timing delays for proper power sequencing. 3. **Security analysis**: - **No vulnerability being fixed**: This is purely adding hardware support, not fixing any security issue - **No sensitive operations**: The change only affects display panel timing delays during power-on/off sequences - **No memory management issues**: Just adding a static entry to a lookup table - **No access control changes**: No changes to permissions or access mechanisms - **No input validation issues**: The entry is statically defined, not processing user input - **No buffer overflows**: Adding one entry to a static array with proper sentinel termination 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (which are marked as "CVE Status: NO") involve similar panel additions or timing adjustments, and none were assigned CVEs. This follows the exact same pattern. **Answer: NO** This commit adds hardware support for a new eDP panel with appropriate timing delays. It introduces no security vulnerabilities - it's purely a hardware compatibility addition that defines static timing parameters for proper panel power sequencing. The change is limited to display driver functionality with no security implications.
467dce3817bd2 drm/buddy: fix issue that force_merge cannot free all roots
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual commit. Based on the code change and my understanding of the drm_buddy memory management system: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit fixes a memory management bug in the DRM buddy allocator's cleanup function (`drm_buddy_fini`), but it does **not** represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **Reasons:** 1. **Memory Leak, Not Security Issue**: The bug causes some memory blocks (root blocks beyond the first one) to not be properly freed during cleanup in `drm_buddy_fini`. This is a resource leak issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Change Analysis**: - The fix changes `__force_merge(mm, 0, size, order)` to `__force_merge(mm, start, start + size, order)` - Where `start = drm_buddy_block_offset(mm->roots[i])` - This ensures each root block is force-merged using its correct offset range 3. **No Security Impact**: - The issue occurs during driver/system shutdown (in `drm_buddy_fini`) - Memory leaks during cleanup don't create exploitable security conditions - No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or privilege escalation opportunities - No user-controllable data involved 4. **Comparison with CVE Examples**: Unlike the provided similar commits that fix race conditions, use-after-free bugs, or access control issues, this commit only fixes a cleanup/resource management issue without security implications. 5. **Impact**: The bug would cause memory to not be fully freed during driver unload, potentially leading to memory exhaustion over time, but this is a reliability/resource management issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses proper resource cleanup rather than any exploitable security flaw.
7170130e4c72c x86/mm/init: Handle the special case of device private pages in add_pages(), to not increase max_pfn and trigger dma_addressing_limited() bounce buffers
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and its security implications, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: ## Analysis Summary ### 1. **Nature of the Fix** This commit fixes a **performance regression**, not a security vulnerability. The code changes specifically address: - Incorrect `max_pfn` updates when device private memory is added via `add_pages()` - Performance issues caused by unnecessary bounce buffer usage in DMA operations - GPU performance degradation on AMD systems ### 2. **Code Changes Are Defensive Programming** The fix adds a conditional check (`if (!params->pgmap)`) to prevent updating `max_pfn` when device private memory is being added. This is purely defensive logic that: - Prevents performance degradation - Maintains correct memory management semantics - Does not fix any exploitable security flaw ### 3. **No Security Boundary Violation** While the commit affects memory management, it does not: - Fix buffer overflows or memory corruption issues - Address privilege escalation vulnerabilities - Resolve access control bypasses - Fix information disclosure bugs - Address any memory safety issues ### 4. **Comparison with Similar CVE-Assigned Commits** Looking at the reference commits that **were** assigned CVEs: - **Similar Commit 2**: Fixed soft lockup/DoS due to infinite loops in kmemleak scanning - **Similar Commit 4**: Fixed kernel memory out-of-bounds write in GPU metrics allocation - **Similar Commit 5**: Fixed improper MMIO page mapping that could expose device registers In contrast, this commit fixes a performance issue where DMA operations unnecessarily use bounce buffers, causing slowdown but no security compromise. ### 5. **Root Cause Analysis** The underlying issue stems from the interaction between: - KASLR memory layout changes (commit 7ffb791423c7) - Zone device private memory registration - DMA addressing limitation detection (`dma_addressing_limited()`) The fix ensures device private memory doesn't artificially inflate `max_pfn`, which was causing `dma_addressing_limited()` to incorrectly return true and trigger bounce buffering. **Conclusion**: This is a performance optimization fix, not a security vulnerability fix, and therefore does not warrant CVE assignment.
d160dc6f53914 drm/xe: Add locks in gtidle code
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, kernel source code, and comparison with similar commits, here is my security assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This commit adds proper locking protection to the GT idle residency counters in the Intel xe graphics driver. While it addresses a race condition, it does not fix a security vulnerability for the following reasons: ### 1. **Nature of the Race Condition** The race condition occurs when multiple userspace clients concurrently read sysfs files that expose GT idle residency values. The commit message explicitly states this is to protect against "multiple entrypoints, for example when multiple userspace clients read the sysfs file." ### 2. **Impact Assessment** Looking at the code changes: - **Data Structure**: The race affects `cur_residency` and `prev_residency` counters used for calculating idle time metrics - **Impact**: Worst case would be inconsistent/corrupted residency counter values returned to userspace - **No Memory Corruption**: The race doesn't lead to memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access to unauthorized memory - **No Privilege Boundary Crossing**: The affected data structures are performance counters, not security-critical resources ### 3. **Comparison with CVE-Assigned Commits** The similar commits provided that received CVEs all involved: - **Missing lock releases** leading to deadlocks or resource leaks - **Use-after-free vulnerabilities** from improper synchronization - **Missing error handling** that could lead to security issues This commit is fundamentally different - it's adding new locking to protect statistical counters, not fixing a vulnerability. ### 4. **Code Path Analysis** The protected functions (`get_residency_ms`, `xe_gt_idle_residency_msec`) are: - **Performance monitoring only**: Calculate GPU idle time statistics - **Read-only data exposure**: Sysfs interfaces that expose metrics to userspace - **No security boundaries involved**: No authentication, authorization, or isolation mechanisms affected ### 5. **Risk Classification** This is a **hardening/robustness** improvement rather than a security fix. The race condition could potentially cause: - Incorrect performance statistics - Minor data corruption in counters - But **no** privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service The commit adds `raw_spinlock_t` protection specifically for future perf PMU integration, indicating this is infrastructure improvement for performance monitoring, not vulnerability remediation.
c5e3306a424b5 drm/atomic: clarify the rules around drm_atomic_state->allow_modeset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can see that this is purely a documentation clarification commit that does not fix any security vulnerability. **NO** This commit only updates documentation/comments in the header file `include/drm/drm_atomic.h` without changing any functional code. Specifically: 1. **No code changes**: The commit only modifies documentation comments for the `allow_modeset` field in `struct drm_atomic_state`. No actual implementation logic is changed. 2. **Documentation clarification only**: The changes expand the original brief documentation ("Drivers should never consult this flag") into more detailed rules about when and how drivers should interact with the `allow_modeset` flag. 3. **No security implications**: The commit message mentions that MSM driver was "automagically upgrading normal commits to full modesets" which breaks UAPI, but this commit doesn't fix that issue - it only clarifies the documentation to prevent such issues in the future. 4. **Reference to similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, similar documentation-only commits (like "Similar Commit 3") are marked as "CVE Status: NO", which aligns with this assessment. 5. **No vulnerability fix**: There's no indication that this addresses any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security vulnerability patterns. This is a preventive documentation improvement to clarify API usage rules, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
174e9ce0daf6a drm/xe/guc: Drop error messages about missing GuC logs
- [sasha] Based on the analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The changes only remove error messages (`xe_gt_err()` calls) from the `xe_guc_log_snapshot_capture()` function in lines 152-157. The removed error messages were: - "GuC log buffer not allocated\n" - "GuC log snapshot not allocated\n" 2. **No Functional Changes**: The commit does not change any security-relevant functionality. The same null pointer checks remain in place (lines 152 and 155-157), but they now return silently instead of logging error messages. 3. **UI/UX Improvement Only**: According to the commit message, this is purely to reduce noise in logs. The error messages were showing up during normal GPU hangs and in valid scenarios like SRIOV VFs where GuC logs are legitimately unavailable. 4. **No Access Control or Memory Safety Changes**: There are no changes to buffer handling, memory allocation, access controls, or other security-sensitive operations. The underlying logic remains identical. 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - driver improvements, error handling fixes, and logging changes that don't involve security vulnerabilities. This commit addresses a usability issue (excessive error logging) rather than any security vulnerability. The code's security posture remains unchanged.
41b4b11da0215 drm: Add valid clones check
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: **Analysis of the code changes:** 1. **Defensive validation, not security fix**: The commit adds a `drm_atomic_check_valid_clones()` function that validates encoder compatibility constraints using the `possible_clones` bitmask. This is input validation to prevent invalid hardware configurations. 2. **No security implications identified**: - No memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No privilege escalation vectors - No access control bypasses - The validation returns `-EINVAL` for invalid configurations, which is proper error handling 3. **Context indicates feature enablement**: The commit is part of a "concurrent writeback" feature series, adding validation to ensure only compatible encoder combinations are used together. This is new functionality validation rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike the reference commits that were assigned CVEs (which fixed actual bugs like missing reference counting or incorrect bitmask initialization), this commit proactively adds validation for a new feature. 5. **No evidence of exploitability**: The validation prevents undefined hardware states but there's no indication this could lead to security-relevant outcomes like kernel crashes, memory corruption, or privilege escalation. This is a robustness improvement that prevents invalid hardware configurations during atomic state validation, not a security vulnerability fix.
bbd8429264baf drm/xe: Always setup GT MMIO adjustment data
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the xe driver codebase, here is my assessment: **NO** While this commit fixes a potential issue with uninitialized MMIO adjustment data, it does **not** warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Initialization vs. Security Bug**: The commit explicitly adds initialization of `adj_offset = 0` and `adj_limit = 0` for non-media GT cases. Since these are the correct values for non-media GT (no adjustment needed), this is fixing missing initialization rather than a security vulnerability. 2. **Limited Impact Scope**: The issue only manifests when `xe_gt_mmio_init()` is called multiple times in VF scenarios during early probe. This is a very specific and limited circumstance that affects driver robustness rather than creating a security vulnerability. 3. **No Evidence of Exploitability**: The commit message describes this as avoiding "stale data" during re-runs, not fixing incorrect memory access or privilege escalation. The stale data would still result in either correct operation (if previously zero) or incorrect register addressing that would likely cause driver malfunction rather than security compromise. 4. **Missing Security Language**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which mentioned "carnage" from accessing unmapped/remapped memory), this commit uses neutral language about avoiding "stale data" and ensuring proper re-initialization. 5. **Defensive Programming**: This appears to be defensive programming to make the driver more robust against multiple initialization calls rather than fixing an active security vulnerability. The fix in `drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_gt.c` at lines 641-644 is a robustness improvement, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
f3b59457808f6 drm/xe: Do not attempt to bootstrap VF in execlists mode
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding. Let me analyze this commit: **Analysis:** 1. **What the function does**: `xe_device_uc_enabled()` returns `!xe->info.force_execlist`, meaning it returns true when the device is NOT in execlist mode (i.e., when GuC/microcontroller submission is enabled). 2. **What the change does**: The commit adds a check `if (!xe_device_uc_enabled(gt_to_xe(gt))) return -ENODEV;` at the beginning of `xe_gt_sriov_vf_bootstrap()`. 3. **Context**: This is in SR-IOV VF (Single Root I/O Virtualization Virtual Function) code. VFs require GuC (Graphics microcontroller Unit) for proper operation, but the code was previously attempting to bootstrap VF even when the system was in execlist mode (where GuC is disabled). 4. **Security implications**: The commit message explicitly states this is a "bomb out as hard as possible" fix for an unsupported configuration. This is a **correctness/robustness fix**, not a security vulnerability fix. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" are similar driver robustness improvements, assertion additions, or configuration fixes - none address actual security vulnerabilities. 6. **Impact**: This prevents attempting to use VF functionality in an unsupported configuration (execlist mode), avoiding potential undefined behavior or system instability, but does not fix a security vulnerability. **NO** This commit prevents VF bootstrap when GuC is disabled (execlist mode), which is an unsupported configuration. While it improves robustness by failing early instead of attempting unsupported operations, it does not fix a security vulnerability. The change is a defensive programming practice to prevent undefined behavior in an invalid configuration, similar to the assertion-adding commits in the reference examples.
0af944f0e3082 drm/xe: Reject BO eviction if BO is bound to current VM
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the security implications using the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Creates Exploitable Denial of Service**: The commit introduces a mechanism that allows buffer object eviction to be rejected when BOs are bound to VMs in preempt fence mode. This can be exploited by malicious users to: - Create VMs with `XE_VM_FLAG_LR_MODE` set - Bind large numbers of buffer objects to these VMs - Prevent GPU memory reclamation during memory pressure - Cause system-wide memory exhaustion 2. **Security-Relevant Code Change**: The added code at lines 819-832 in `xe_bo_move()` introduces a new attack vector by checking: ```c if (evict && ctx->resv) { // Check if BO is bound to current VM and reject eviction if (xe_vm_resv(vm) == ctx->resv && xe_vm_in_preempt_fence_mode(vm)) { ret = -EBUSY; goto out; } } ``` 3. **Memory Management Vulnerability**: Unlike the reference commits that fix existing vulnerabilities (null pointer dereference, parameter validation), this commit introduces new functionality that creates a security weakness in the memory management subsystem. 4. **No Adequate Safeguards**: The commit lacks proper resource limits, emergency eviction capabilities, or other protections against abuse of the eviction rejection mechanism. 5. **Comparison with Similar CVE-assigned Commits**: The reference commits that received CVEs addressed similar GPU memory management issues - this commit creates rather than fixes such issues. The commit introduces a mechanism that can be exploited for denial of service attacks through memory exhaustion, making it a legitimate security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
13265fe7426ec drm/xe/vf: Perform early GT MMIO initialization to read GMDID
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and security implications: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Functional Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: The null pointer dereference at address `0000000000190240` is caused by an initialization ordering issue where `gt->mmio` is uninitialized when VF code attempts to read GMDID values. This is a programming error rather than a security flaw. 2. **Controlled Failure Mode**: The NPD crash results in a controlled kernel panic rather than exploitable memory corruption. Modern kernel protections (SMEP, SMAP, KASLR) prevent this from being leveraged for privilege escalation. 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The issue only affects SR-IOV Virtual Functions in Intel Xe graphics drivers during initialization. It cannot be triggered by unprivileged user input - it occurs during driver probe/initialization sequences. 4. **No Memory Safety Violation**: The fix simply adds `xe_gt_mmio_init(gt);` to ensure proper initialization order. This is a straightforward ordering fix rather than addressing buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues. 5. **Similar Precedent**: Comparing to the provided examples, this resembles "Similar Commit 5" (CVE Status: NO) which also fixed a failure handling issue without security implications, rather than "Similar Commit 2" (CVE Status: YES) which involved memory mapping security concerns. While this bug can cause denial of service in virtualized environments, it lacks the characteristics typically required for CVE assignment such as exploitability, privilege escalation potential, or memory corruption vulnerabilities.
5251fd321684b wifi: rtw89: coex: Add protect to avoid A2DP lag while Wi-Fi connecting
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on detailed analysis of both the commit and the broader rtw89 driver codebase, this is clearly a **performance/compatibility improvement** rather than a security vulnerability fix. **Key evidence against CVE assignment:** 1. **Purpose is performance optimization**: The commit explicitly addresses "A2DP lag while Wi-Fi connecting" - this is audio quality improvement, not security. 2. **No security vulnerability patterns**: The code changes don't fix any of the common security issues like: - Buffer overflows - Use-after-free - Race conditions leading to memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Input validation bypasses 3. **Mechanism is timing coordination**: The changes add `fsleep(30)` calls and coordination flags (`con_rfk`) to allow Bluetooth traffic between WiFi RF calibrations - this is pure coexistence optimization. 4. **Comparison with actual security fixes**: The rtw89 driver has had real CVE-worthy vulnerabilities (race conditions causing NULL pointer dereference, memory leaks, etc.) - this commit doesn't match those patterns. 5. **No attack vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit A2DP audio lag timing to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause system compromise. This falls into the same category as Similar Commits 2, 3, and 5 which were correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they improve functionality/performance but don't address security vulnerabilities.
380b0cdaa76bc drm/xe: Move suballocator init to after display init
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, the code changes, and the context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Code Change Analysis**: The commit moves the suballocator initialization (`xe_sa_bo_manager_init`) from `xe_tile_init_noalloc()` to a new `xe_tile_init()` function that is called after display initialization. This is purely a timing/ordering change. 2. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to prevent allocations before display framebuffer preservation. The code comments in `xe_tile.c:155` confirm this is about preventing the "inherited display framebuffer" from being "overwritten as it is usually put at the start of VRAM." 3. **No Security Vulnerability**: - This is not fixing a memory corruption, buffer overflow, or access control issue - There's no indication of privilege escalation or information disclosure - The change is about proper initialization ordering, not fixing a security flaw - The suballocator still gets initialized with the same parameters (SZ_1M, 16) 4. **Similar Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this follows the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a driver initialization/ordering fix without security implications, similar to "drm/xe: Remove double pageflip" and "drm/xe/display: Fix double mutex initialization." 5. **Risk Assessment**: While early memory allocations could theoretically corrupt display framebuffers, this would result in display corruption rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The commit is a correctness fix for display initialization ordering, not a security vulnerability fix.
bbae6680cfe38 drm/nouveau: fix the broken marco GSP_MSG_MAX_SIZE
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see that `GSP_PAGE_SIZE` is defined as `BIT(GSP_PAGE_SHIFT)` where `GSP_PAGE_SHIFT` is 12, so `GSP_PAGE_SIZE` = 2^12 = 4096 = 0x1000. Now I understand the issue: 1. **Before the fix**: `GSP_MSG_MAX_SIZE` was defined as `GSP_PAGE_MIN_SIZE kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 16` where `GSP_PAGE_MIN_SIZE` doesn't exist - this was a broken macro that would cause compilation errors if used. 2. **After the fix**: `GSP_MSG_MAX_SIZE` was fixed to be `(GSP_MSG_MIN_SIZE kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 16)` where `GSP_MSG_MIN_SIZE` is `GSP_PAGE_SIZE` (4096), so `GSP_MSG_MAX_SIZE` becomes 4096 kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 16 = 65536. 3. **The code was using a magic number**: In `r535_gsp_rpc_push()`, instead of using the broken macro, the code was using `(16 kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 0x1000)` which equals 16 kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 4096 = 65536, the same value. **NO** This commit fixes a broken macro definition but does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **No security impact**: The macro was broken (referencing a non-existent `GSP_PAGE_MIN_SIZE`) and couldn't be used without compilation errors. 2. **No functional change**: The code was already using the correct value via magic numbers (`16 kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md 0x1000` = 65536) to avoid the broken macro. 3. **Code cleanup only**: This is purely a code improvement to fix the macro definition so it can replace magic numbers, as evidenced by the follow-up commit that replaces the magic number with the fixed macro. 4. **No buffer overflow or memory safety issue**: The buffer size calculations were already correct using the magic numbers. This is a code maintenance fix that improves readability and reduces magic numbers, but has no security implications since the actual memory allocation and bounds checking were already working correctly.
c852646f12d4c drm: bridge: adv7511: fill stream capabilities
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit only adds two configuration flags (`no_i2s_capture = 1` and `no_spdif_capture = 1`) to the `hdmi_codec_pdata` structure in `drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/adv7511/adv7511_audio.c:251-253`. 2. **Purpose**: According to the commit message and code analysis, this is purely a capability declaration fix - it correctly reports that the ADV7511 HDMI bridge hardware does not support audio capture functionality, only playback. 3. **Security implications**: - No memory management changes - No access control modifications - No input validation changes - No privilege escalation risks - No buffer overflow potential 4. **Impact assessment**: This is a hardware capability declaration that prevents the audio subsystem from attempting unsupported capture operations. The flags are defined in `/home/sasha/linux/include/sound/hdmi-codec.h:126,129` as part of the legitimate API. 5. **Comparison to similar commits**: All provided similar commits in the ADV7511 audio subsystem were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar non-security audio functionality improvements. This is a straightforward hardware capability correction that improves system behavior by preventing futile attempts to use non-existent capture functionality, with no security vulnerabilities introduced or fixed.
eeadc6baf8b3d wifi: ath11k: Use dma_alloc_noncoherent for rx_tid buffer allocation
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it addresses important DMA buffer management issues, the analysis shows this is primarily a **correctness and performance improvement** rather than a security vulnerability fix. Key reasons: 1. **No Direct Security Exploit**: The change from `kzalloc()/dma_map_single()` to `dma_alloc_noncoherent()` fixes cache coherency issues for long-lived rx_tid buffers, but there's no evidence of a direct exploitable security vulnerability. 2. **Stability vs Security**: The commit message explicitly states the motivation is that long-lived cacheable DMA buffers "are not advisable" - this indicates a best practices improvement rather than fixing an active security flaw. 3. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit #1 (marked CVE Status: NO) has very similar characteristics - it also changes DMA allocation methods to fix buffer management issues without security implications. 4. **Trust Boundary**: The WiFi hardware DMA operations occur within the kernel's existing trust boundary. The rx_tid buffers are used for packet reordering control between the driver and WiFi chip, not for security-critical operations. The security-relevant aspects (cache coherency, proper DMA synchronization) are important for system stability and proper hardware/software state management, but don't constitute a CVE-worthy vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation or information disclosure.
8a9c06b40882e wifi: ath12k: report station mode transmit rate
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the code changes, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Change:** This commit implements a feature enhancement to report station mode transmit rates. It adds functionality to parse and report tx rate information from firmware completion reports to mac80211, allowing tools like `iw dev xxx station dump` to display correct transmit rates. **Security Analysis:** 1. **Input Validation Present:** The code includes proper bounds checking: - `if (ts->mcs > ATH12K_HT_MCS_MAX)` for HT - `if (ts->mcs > ATH12K_VHT_MCS_MAX)` for VHT - `if (ts->mcs > ATH12K_HE_MCS_MAX)` for HE - `if (ts->mcs > ATH12K_EHT_MCS_MAX)` for EHT - Each check returns early with a warning if bounds are exceeded 2. **Memory Safety:** - Uses proper locking (`spin_lock_bh(&ab->base_lock)`) around peer lookups - Validates peer existence before accessing: `if (!peer || !peer->sta)` - No direct memory writes to user-controlled addresses 3. **No Privilege Escalation:** This only reports transmit rate statistics to userspace tools - it doesn't change access controls or security boundaries 4. **Information Disclosure:** While this exposes transmit rate information, this is intended functionality for network monitoring tools and doesn't leak sensitive data 5. **Similar Commits:** All provided reference commits with similar wireless driver functionality were marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of change doesn't typically warrant CVE assignment The commit adds new functionality without fixing an existing vulnerability, and includes appropriate validation and error handling. This is a feature enhancement rather than a security fix.
87478ba50a05a drm/ast: Hide Gens 1 to 3 TX detection in branch
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Change:** The commit reorganizes TX chip detection logic by moving generation-specific code into appropriate conditional branches. Previously, the generation 1-3 detection code (reading VGACRA3 register) would run on all hardware generations, but now it's properly gated behind an `if (AST_GEN(ast) <= 3)` check. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Code Organization Fix**: This is primarily a correctness and maintainability improvement, ensuring that hardware-generation-specific code only runs on the appropriate hardware. 2. **No Security Impact**: The TX chip detection determines what type of display output chip is present (SIL164, DP501, etc.). Incorrect detection would affect display functionality but doesn't create security vulnerabilities like: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Use-after-free conditions 3. **Limited Blast Radius**: Any issues would be confined to display driver functionality and would not compromise system security. 4. **Hardware-Specific**: The impact is limited to specific AST graphics hardware and requires local access. **Comparison with CVE Examples:** Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (which involved null pointer dereferences, array bounds issues, and missing validation), this commit addresses hardware compatibility logic without memory safety or privilege implications. This is routine driver maintenance, not a security fix requiring CVE assignment.
24f587572acf7 wifi: ath12k: Fetch regdb.bin file from board-2.bin
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a functional fix to improve regdb.bin file fetching from board-2.bin files, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit adds support to fetch regulatory database files using a default board ID when the specific board ID fails. 2. **No security implications**: The change modifies how board names are constructed for firmware file lookup, specifically using `ATH12K_BOARD_ID_DEFAULT` (0xFF) instead of the device-specific board ID when `with_default` is true. This is purely a firmware loading mechanism enhancement. 3. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is similar to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" which deal with firmware/board data loading improvements without security implications. 4. **Code analysis**: The change is in `__ath12k_core_create_board_name()` at line 214-215, where it conditionally uses either `ATH12K_BOARD_ID_DEFAULT` or `ab->qmi.target.board_id`. This doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, access control bypasses, or privilege escalation issues. 5. **Commit message context**: The commit message clearly states this is to fix regdb.bin fetching functionality, not addressing any security concerns. 6. **No sensitive components affected**: While this affects firmware loading, it doesn't modify memory management, access controls, input validation, or other security-critical components in a way that would create vulnerabilities. This is a standard feature enhancement/bug fix that improves firmware loading reliability without security implications.
dfffb317519f8 wifi: ath9k: return by of_get_mac_address
- [sasha] Now I understand the code fully. Let me analyze the security implications: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit does **not** warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ### What the commit does: The commit modifies `ath9k_of_init()` in `/drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/init.c:650-652` to properly handle the return value of `of_get_mac_address()`. Specifically: 1. **Before**: `of_get_mac_address(np, common->macaddr);` - return value was ignored 2. **After**: `ret = of_get_mac_address(np, common->macaddr); if (ret == -EPROBE_DEFER) return ret;` - now propagates `-EPROBE_DEFER` to caller ### Why this is NOT a security issue: 1. **No vulnerability fixed**: This is purely a **functional improvement** for proper device initialization timing, not a security fix. 2. **Race condition context**: The issue described is a **timing/ordering problem** during driver loading when nvmem (non-volatile memory) isn't ready yet. The `-EPROBE_DEFER` mechanism is Linux kernel's standard way to handle such dependencies. 3. **No security-sensitive components affected**: This only affects: - MAC address retrieval from device tree - Driver probe timing - No memory management, access control, or privilege issues involved 4. **Pattern matches non-CVE examples**: This follows the same pattern as similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" in the examples: - Similar Commit 1: Added error checking for `devm_kstrdup()` - marked NO - Similar Commit 3: Added nvmem properties for MAC address - marked NO - Similar Commit 5: Revert of country code restoration - marked NO 5. **No mention of security in commit message**: The commit message focuses entirely on proper initialization sequencing when "nvmem could potentially be loaded before ath9k" - this is a device initialization issue, not a security vulnerability. The change ensures proper driver initialization ordering but has no security implications.
6788a666000d6 wifi: ath12k: Fix end offset bit definition in monitor ring descriptor
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a technical issue with bit field extraction, the security implications are minimal and well-contained: 1. **Limited Security Impact**: The incorrect bit mask only affects the `end_offset` calculation in monitor ring descriptors. The code includes robust bounds checking (`end_offset <= DP_RX_BUFFER_SIZE`) that prevents buffer overflows. 2. **Protective Mechanisms**: When an invalid offset is detected, the driver logs a warning and safely falls back to using `DP_RX_BUFFER_SIZE`, preventing memory corruption. 3. **Constrained Exposure**: This only affects WiFi monitor mode functionality, which is typically used for debugging/analysis rather than normal operation. 4. **No Clear Attack Vector**: The junk values in reserved bits (12-15) would need to be controlled by an attacker through firmware compromise, which requires significant existing privileges. 5. **Comparison with CVE Examples**: The provided CVE examples show "invalid memory access" issues that could cause system instability or crashes. This fix addresses incorrect field extraction but doesn't demonstrate exploitable memory corruption. The fix corrects a specification compliance issue where 4 reserved bits were incorrectly included in the offset calculation, potentially causing wrong packet length values, but existing bounds checking prevents any serious security consequences.
a4d1c5d0b99b7 drm/xe/pf: Move VFs reprovisioning to worker
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is purely a refactoring to move VF reprovisioning from synchronous to asynchronous execution. It does not fix any existing security vulnerability. 2. **Reclaim Safety Improvement**: The commit message specifically states this change is to avoid allocations under mutex protection to be "reclaim-safe." This is actually a **positive** change that improves system stability by preventing potential deadlocks during memory pressure. 3. **Proper Synchronization Maintained**: The analysis shows that critical security protections are maintained: - The `master_mutex` protection is still used in `xe_gt_sriov_pf_config_push()` (lines 2126-2128 in xe_gt_sriov_pf_config.c) - LMEM allocations through `xe_bo_create_pin_map()` still occur under proper protection - VF resource isolation is preserved through the existing locking mechanisms 4. **No Privilege Escalation Risk**: The async worker (`pf_worker_restart_func`) simply calls the same functions (`xe_gt_sriov_pf_config_restart` and `xe_gt_sriov_pf_control_restart`) that were previously called synchronously. No new execution paths or privilege boundaries are introduced. 5. **Pattern Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this type of architectural change (like "don't restart parallel queues multiple times" or "move initialization to worker") is typically classified as **CVE Status: NO**. 6. **Runtime Power Management**: The async worker properly handles `xe_pm_runtime_get/put()`, ensuring the device is powered appropriately during reprovisioning. This is a code quality and system stability improvement, not a security fix. The change moves from potential deadlock-prone synchronous execution to safer asynchronous execution while maintaining all existing security boundaries and protections.
df11edfba49e5 wifi: ath12k: fix ath12k_hal_tx_cmd_ext_desc_setup() info1 override
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue clearly. Let me analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** The commit fixes a bug in `ath12k_hal_tx_cmd_ext_desc_setup()` where line 122 had: ```c tcl_ext_cmd->info1 = le32_encode_bits(1, HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_EXTN_OVERRIDE) | ... ``` But it should be: ```c tcl_ext_cmd->info1 |= le32_encode_bits(1, HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_EXTN_OVERRIDE) | ... ``` The issue is that the code was **overriding** the `info1` field instead of **adding** to it. Looking at the field layout: - `HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_BUF_PTR_HI` (bits 7:0) - `HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_EXTN_OVERRIDE` (bit 8) - `HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_ENCAP_TYPE` (bits 10:9) - `HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_ENCRYPT_TYPE` (bits 14:11) - `HAL_TX_MSDU_EXT_INFO1_BUF_LEN` (bits 31:16) The bug meant that the first assignment (lines 117-120) which sets `BUF_PTR_HI` and `BUF_LEN` was being **completely overwritten** by the second assignment (lines 122-125). This would result in: 1. Buffer pointer high bits being lost (set to 0) 2. Buffer length field being lost (set to 0) However, while this is a functional bug affecting broadcast frames with ethernet encapsulation, the security implications are limited: 1. **No memory corruption**: The buffer length being wrong might cause firmware issues, but doesn't directly lead to buffer overflows in the kernel driver 2. **No privilege escalation**: This affects WiFi frame transmission, not access control 3. **No direct security bypass**: The encryption type and encapsulation are still set correctly **NO** This is a functional bug fix that corrects field initialization logic in WiFi transmission descriptors. While it affects frame transmission functionality, it does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment. The bug results in incorrect buffer metadata being sent to firmware but does not create exploitable security conditions like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or security bypasses.
5a6a461079dec regulator: ad5398: Add device tree support
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a functional enhancement that adds device tree support to the ad5398 regulator driver. It does not fix a security vulnerability. The changes: 1. **Add device tree support**: Include `of_regulator.h` header and use `of_get_regulator_init_data()` to parse device tree nodes 2. **Reorganize initialization logic**: Move the `init_data` validation check after attempting to get data from device tree 3. **Set device tree node**: Assign `config.of_node` for proper device tree integration The commit addresses a functional limitation where the driver would fail to probe when using device tree (which is the modern approach) instead of deprecated platform_data. This is similar to Similar Commits 1, 2, and 5 which also added device tree/device table support without fixing security issues. There are no security implications - the changes don't affect memory management, access control, input validation, or introduce buffer overflows. This is purely about modernizing the driver's initialization path to support device tree configuration.
00451eb3bec76 wifi: rtw88: Don't use static local variable in rtw8822b_set_tx_power_index_by_rate
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit for the RTW88 driver. Based on the provided information, I can see this is about a static local variable issue in the TX power setting function. Let me examine the security implications: ## Analysis of RTW88 Commit **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ### 1. **Nature of the Fix** The commit addresses a **static local variable** (`static u32 phy_pwr_idx`) that could theoretically cause issues when multiple identical USB devices are used simultaneously. The fix moves this variable to the caller scope and passes it by reference. ### 2. **Security Impact Assessment** **Limited Security Implications:** - **Race Condition**: The static variable could cause TX power confusion between multiple devices, but this affects **device functionality**, not security boundaries - **No Memory Corruption**: The fix involves variable scope management, not buffer overflows or memory safety issues - **No Privilege Escalation**: TX power settings don't provide pathways to elevated privileges - **No Information Disclosure**: The issue affects power calibration values, not sensitive data ### 3. **Comparison with CVE-assigned Similar Commits** Looking at the similar commits provided: - **Similar Commits 4 & 5 (CVE: YES)**: These had **out-of-bounds reading** issues - actual memory safety violations - **Current Commit**: Has a **variable scope/sharing** issue - functional problem, not memory safety ### 4. **Real-world Impact** - **Functional Issue**: May cause incorrect TX power values when multiple identical devices are connected - **Device Interference**: Could affect wireless transmission quality - **No System Compromise**: Does not provide attack vectors for system exploitation ### 5. **CVE Criteria Not Met** - No unauthorized access potential - No memory safety violations - No privilege boundary violations - No input validation vulnerabilities - Affects device functionality, not security This is a **functional correctness fix** for multi-device scenarios, similar to the non-CVE commits in the reference set, rather than a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
ebfc9199df05d wifi: rtw89: add wiphy_lock() to work that isn't held wiphy_lock() yet
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **This is a locking improvement, not a security fix**: The commit adds `wiphy_lock()` calls around existing code that was already protected by driver-specific mutexes (`rtwdev->mutex`). The commit message explicitly states this is preparation "so afterward we can remove driver mutex safely." 2. **No vulnerability is being fixed**: The code changes show that the existing `mutex_lock(&rtwdev->mutex)` calls remain in place, and `wiphy_lock()` is added as an additional layer of protection. This is a proactive hardening measure, not a response to a discovered vulnerability. 3. **Pattern matches non-CVE similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, several show locking improvements and mutex additions that were marked as "CVE Status: NO" (e.g., the wifi cfg80211 wiphy mutex checks, the mac80211 locking improvements). These are architectural improvements rather than security fixes. 4. **Code context shows this is infrastructure work**: The functions being modified (`rtw89_regd_notifier` for regulatory domain handling and `ser_l2_reset_st_hdl` for system error recovery) are being updated to comply with the WiFi subsystem's locking requirements, where `wiphy_lock()` is expected to be held when calling certain cfg80211 functions. 5. **No security-sensitive behavior is being changed**: The core functionality of the modified functions remains the same - they still perform the same regulatory updates and error recovery procedures, just with additional locking protection. This commit represents proactive infrastructure work to align with WiFi subsystem locking requirements rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
3d3e28feca7ac wifi: rtl8xxxu: retry firmware download on error
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit by examining the key changes: **CVE Analysis for "wifi: rtl8xxxu: retry firmware download on error"** **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a robustness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit adds retry logic to handle occasional EPROTO errors during firmware download that cause device probe failures. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - The main change is wrapping the `rtl8xxxu_download_firmware(priv)` call in a retry loop (5 attempts) - The retry only occurs on `-EAGAIN` errors (converted from EPROTO in the `rtl8xxxu_writeN` function) - Also reduces log verbosity by making write error messages conditional on debug flags 3. **Security Implications**: - No memory safety issues are addressed - No access control changes - No privilege escalation fixes - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: - Similar Commits 1, 2, and 5 (CVE Status: NO) also deal with firmware loading retry/robustness but without security implications - Similar Commits 3 and 4 (CVE Status: YES) addressed use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in firmware loading, which are actual memory safety issues 5. **Root Cause**: The issue being fixed is hardware-level communication errors (EPROTO from USB stack), not software vulnerabilities. The retry mechanism simply makes the driver more resilient to transient hardware communication failures. This commit improves driver reliability and user experience but does not address any security vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously.
598bdf4fefff5 perf/amd/ibs: Fix ->config to sample period calculation for OP PMU
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the code changes and commit message: **NO** This commit fixes a calculation bug in the IBS (Instruction Based Sampling) OP PMU sample period derivation, but it does **not** represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit fixes an incorrect bit field calculation in `arch/x86/events/amd/ibs.c:319-344`. The old code was incorrectly shifting **all** MaxCnt bits (including high bits), when it should only shift the low bits and OR them with the high bits. 2. **Code change specifics**: - **Before**: `max_cnt = config & perf_ibs->cnt_mask; period = max_cnt << 4;` - **After**: For OP PMU: `period = (config & IBS_OP_MAX_CNT) << 4; if (ibs_caps & IBS_CAPS_OPCNTEXT) period |= config & IBS_OP_MAX_CNT_EXT_MASK;` 3. **Impact**: This bug would cause **incorrect sample period calculations** when using the IBS OP PMU with MaxCnt values, leading to: - Wrong sampling frequencies - Potentially misleading performance measurement data - Incorrect profiling results 4. **Security implications**: None. This is a **functional correctness bug** in performance monitoring code, not a security vulnerability. The incorrect calculation: - Does not allow privilege escalation - Does not expose sensitive information - Does not create buffer overflows or memory corruption - Does not affect access controls or system security boundaries 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: The similar commits provided as reference (all marked "CVE Status: NO") are also performance monitoring fixes without security implications, except for one integer overflow fix that was marked "YES" but involved potential overflow conditions. This is a straightforward functional bug fix in performance monitoring hardware abstraction that improves measurement accuracy but has no security impact.
f6f73b891bf6b clk: renesas: rzg2l-cpg: Refactor Runtime PM clock validation
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the context. Let me examine the security implication. The key issue is in the bounds checking. Let me analyze the specific differences: **NO** This commit is a refactor that **improves security** rather than fixes a vulnerability. The key security-relevant change is the addition of proper bounds checking: In the old code: ```c static bool rzg2l_cpg_is_pm_clk(struct rzg2l_cpg_priv *priv, const struct of_phandle_args *clkspec) { // No bounds checking on clkspec->args[1] if (clkspec->args[0] != CPG_MOD) return false; id = clkspec->args[1] + info->num_total_core_clks; // Potential overflow } ``` In the new code: ```c case CPG_MOD: { unsigned int id = clkspec->args[1]; if (id >= priv->num_mod_clks) // NEW: Bounds check added return false; id += info->num_total_core_clks; } ``` The new version adds a critical bounds check (`if (id >= priv->num_mod_clks)`) that prevents potential out-of-bounds access when validating clock IDs. This is a **security improvement** that prevents potential buffer overflows or invalid memory access, rather than fixing an existing exploitable vulnerability. The commit also improves the device node validation (`clkspec->np != pd->genpd.dev.of_node`) to ensure proper power domain association, which prevents incorrect Runtime PM management. Since this is a proactive security improvement rather than a fix for an exploitable vulnerability, it does not warrant a CVE assignment.
8685520474bfc accel/qaic: Mask out SR-IOV PCI resources
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Proactive Security Hardening**: The commit adds a mask (`& 0x3f`) to filter out SR-IOV BARs during device initialization. The mask `0x3f` (binary: 111111) ensures only the first 6 standard PCI BARs (0-5) are considered, excluding SR-IOV VF BARs that appear in higher bit positions. 2. **No Evidence of Exploitable Vulnerability**: The commit message describes this as filtering out SR-IOV BARs "if they exist" - this is preventive hardening rather than fixing an active vulnerability. There's no indication that the qaic devices actually expose SR-IOV BARs that were being incorrectly processed. 3. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This matches the pattern of Similar Commit 4 (PCI ID organization) and Similar Commit 2 (BAR ordering fixes) - both were functional improvements without CVEs. The change ensures correct BAR handling rather than fixing an exploitable security flaw. 4. **Functional Correctness**: The driver expects specific BARs (0, 2, and 4) and validates them against `config->bar_mask`. Including unexpected SR-IOV BARs would likely cause initialization failures rather than security vulnerabilities. 5. **Defense in Depth**: This is a defensive programming practice to ensure robust device initialization, similar to input validation - important for system stability but not addressing an active security threat. The commit represents good security engineering practice but lacks the exploitable vulnerability characteristics that warrant CVE assignment. It's preventive hardening rather than vulnerability remediation.
21ee965267bcb firmware: arm_scmi: Relax duplicate name constraint across protocol ids
- [sasha] Now I have enough information to analyze this commit. Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Code Changes Analysis The commit changes the duplicate name checking logic in `scmi_protocol_device_request()` from: **Before:** Checking for duplicate device names across **ALL** protocols (using `idr_for_each_entry` to iterate through all protocol lists) **After:** Checking for duplicate device names only within the **SAME** protocol ID (using `idr_find` to directly lookup the specific protocol) ## Security Assessment 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This is a functional improvement, not a security fix. The change relaxes a constraint rather than fixing a vulnerability. 2. **Device Matching Logic Supports This Change**: The `scmi_dev_match_id()` function at line 212-213 shows that device matching first checks `protocol_id` and then the `name`. This means devices with the same name in different protocols are naturally isolated by the protocol ID check. 3. **No Access Control or Memory Safety Issues**: - The change maintains proper mutex locking (`scmi_requested_devices_mtx`) - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control bypasses - No privilege escalation opportunities 4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Comparing to the provided examples: - Similar to "CVE Status: NO" commits like the clkdev name length fix and ti-sn65dsi86 duplicate filename fix - Unlike "CVE Status: YES" commits which fixed actual vulnerabilities (integer overflow, double-free) 5. **Functional Enhancement**: This change allows legitimate use cases where different protocols might legitimately have devices with the same name, which is functionally safe due to the protocol ID namespacing in device matching. The commit is a code cleanup/enhancement that makes the constraint checking more precise and functionally correct, not a security fix.
46dcf85566170 perf/amd/ibs: Fix perf_ibs_op.cnt_mask for CurCnt
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, I can now provide my CVE determination: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No security vulnerability**: The bug is in the `cnt_mask` variable that is used primarily for clearing counter bits during event disabling. The commit message explicitly states that "IBS driver uses cnt_mask[CurCnt] bits only while disabling an event" and "we did not see any issues so far." 2. **Limited functional impact**: The bug affects only the upper 7 bits of the CurCnt mask on newer AMD processors with extended counter support. Since CurCnt bits are not read during re-enabling (MaxCnt is programmed and CurCnt is set to 0), the incorrect mask doesn't cause functional failures. 3. **No security implications**: This is a correctness issue in bit masking for performance counter management, not a security vulnerability. The incorrect mask doesn't lead to: - Information disclosure - Privilege escalation - Buffer overflows - Access control bypass - Any other security-relevant issues 4. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is most similar to "Similar Commit 2" (shift out of bounds fix) and "Similar Commit 4" (xHCI mask fix), both marked as CVE Status: NO. These are correctness fixes for bit operations without security implications. The code changes show a simple fix to include both `IBS_OP_MAX_CNT_EXT_MASK` and `IBS_OP_CUR_CNT_EXT_MASK` in the cnt_mask, ensuring proper masking of extended counter bits. This is a hardware-specific correctness fix, not a security vulnerability.
12fdd29d5d71d bpf: Use kallsyms to find the function name of a struct_ops's stub function
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the kernel tree context, my assessment is: **NO** While this commit does improve security and robustness, it does not fix a specific vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Primary purpose is code improvement, not vulnerability fix**: The commit message clearly states this is about removing the requirement for naming conventions and improving the reliability of finding stub functions. It's not addressing a specific security flaw. 2. **No exploitable vulnerability described**: Unlike similar commit 5 which explicitly addressed a UAF (use-after-free) issue, this commit doesn't describe any specific vulnerability being exploited. The change from "silently ignored" to "will fail" is a robustness improvement, not a security fix. 3. **Functional enhancement over security patch**: The core change (using `kallsyms_lookup` instead of naming convention) is primarily to make the system more flexible and reliable for legitimate use cases, not to prevent attacks. 4. **No security advisory or CVE-worthy impact**: The commit doesn't indicate that the previous naming convention approach posed a security risk - rather, it was surprising developers and not working as expected for new subsystems. 5. **Consistent with reference patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided, those marked "CVE Status: NO" are typically code improvements, refactoring, or fixing non-security bugs, while "CVE Status: YES" commits address specific vulnerabilities like UAF issues. The security improvements (better validation, explicit failure handling) are beneficial side effects of the main functional improvement, but don't constitute fixing a vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
0053f7d39d491 bpftool: Fix readlink usage in get_fd_type
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Why this is NOT a CVE:** 1. **Tool vs. Kernel Distinction**: This is a bug in `bpftool`, which is a userspace utility in the tools directory (`tools/bpf/bpftool/`), not in the kernel itself. CVEs for the Linux kernel typically focus on kernel-space vulnerabilities, not userspace tools bundled with the kernel source. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While the readlink bug creates a potential buffer overflow, the security implications are limited: - Only affects the bpftool binary itself, not kernel security - Requires very specific conditions (exactly 512-byte symlink target) - One-byte overflow with limited exploitation potential - No direct impact on kernel integrity or system security 3. **Comparison with CVE Examples**: Looking at the provided similar commits that received CVEs, they all address kernel-space security issues like out-of-bounds array access in BPF subsystem (`bpf_link_type_strs[link->type]`). This bpftool fix is fundamentally different as it's a userspace tool fix. 4. **Standard Practice**: Buffer overflows in userspace utilities bundled with kernel sources typically don't receive kernel CVEs unless they directly impact kernel security or are exploitable in ways that compromise system integrity. The fix properly addresses a legitimate buffer overflow by changing the truncation check from `sizeof(path)` to `sizeof(buf)` and adding null termination with `buf[n] = '\0'`, but this represents a userspace tool hardening fix rather than a kernel security vulnerability.
89785306453ce spi: zynqmp-gqspi: Always acknowledge interrupts
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and understanding of interrupt handling security implications: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit addresses an interrupt handling correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. Here's the specific analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit modifies the interrupt handler to always return `IRQ_HANDLED` instead of conditionally returning `IRQ_NONE` when certain interrupt conditions occur (like RXEMPTY interrupts that don't require immediate action). 2. **Previous behavior flaw**: Before this fix, the driver would return `IRQ_NONE` for RXEMPTY interrupts even when they were legitimately generated by the device. This could potentially lead to spurious interrupt detection by the kernel. 3. **Security impact assessment**: While improper interrupt handling can lead to system instability and denial of service scenarios, this specific case has several mitigating factors: - The issue affects interrupt acknowledgment correctness, not data handling or access control - The interrupt status is still properly cleared (`zynqmp_gqspi_write(xqspi, GQSPI_ISR_OFST, status)`) - The change prevents potential spurious interrupt detection but doesn't fix an active attack vector - No evidence suggests this was causing actual interrupt storms or system crashes 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the historical examples, CVE-worthy commits typically fix issues that: - Allow data corruption or information disclosure (Similar Commit 1, 5: FIFO contamination) - Create exploitable race conditions or resource conflicts (Similar Commit 4: IRQ conflicts causing crashes) - This commit is more similar to Similar Commit 2 (race condition fix) and Commit 3 (correctness fix), both marked as NO for CVE status. This is a driver correctness and robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix. The change ensures proper interrupt handling semantics but doesn't address an exploitable security flaw.
f4e99b846c901 dm vdo indexer: prevent unterminated string warning
- [sasha] NO This commit is a purely cosmetic fix for a GCC 15 compiler warning about unterminated string initialization. The changes are: 1. **Change from fixed-size array to flexible array**: `static const u8 LAYOUT_MAGIC[MAGIC_SIZE]` becomes `static const u8 LAYOUT_MAGIC[]` 2. **Redefine MAGIC_SIZE**: From a hardcoded `#define MAGIC_SIZE 32` to `#define MAGIC_SIZE (sizeof(LAYOUT_MAGIC) - 1)` The fix is identical in nature to the other "NO CVE" examples provided (Similar Commits 1, 2, and 5) which all address the same GCC 15 `-Werror=unterminated-string-initialization` warning. This is a build compatibility fix that doesn't change the functional behavior, memory layout, or security properties of the code. The string content and resulting array size remain exactly the same - only the declaration method changes to satisfy the stricter compiler warning.
b93afe8a3ac53 irqchip/riscv-aplic: Add support for hart indexes
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. Let me examine the security implications: ## Analysis This commit adds support for arbitrary hart indices in the RISC-V APLIC (Advanced Platform Level Interrupt Controller) driver. Let me analyze the key security considerations: **Code Changes Analysis:** 1. **New function `aplic_direct_get_hart_index()`**: This function reads hart index values from device tree property "riscv,hart-indexes". The function uses `of_property_read_u32_index()` which is a standard, safe API. 2. **Memory address calculation change**: The critical change is in line 287: ```c // Old: idc->regs = priv->regs + APLIC_IDC_BASE + i amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md APLIC_IDC_SIZE; // New: idc->regs = priv->regs + APLIC_IDC_BASE + idc->hart_index amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md APLIC_IDC_SIZE; ``` **Security Implications:** The key security concern is that `idc->hart_index` is now sourced from device tree data (`of_property_read_u32_index()`) rather than being a controlled loop counter `i`. This means: 1. **Potential out-of-bounds access**: If the device tree contains malicious or corrupted hart index values, `idc->hart_index` could be arbitrarily large, leading to out-of-bounds memory access when calculating `idc->regs`. 2. **Memory layout**: Looking at the definitions: - `APLIC_IDC_BASE = 0x4000` - `APLIC_IDC_SIZE = 32` - `APLIC_MAX_IDC = BIT(14) = 16384` 3. **Attack vector**: A malicious device tree could specify hart indexes that cause memory access beyond the intended APLIC register space. 4. **Lack of bounds checking**: The code does not validate that `idc->hart_index` is within reasonable bounds before using it for memory address calculation. However, there are some mitigating factors: - Device tree is typically trusted boot-time data - The change follows the RISC-V APLIC specification - Similar patterns exist in similar commits marked as NO CVE **Comparing to similar commits:** - Similar commits 1-3 were marked NO CVE and involved feature additions - Similar commits 4-5 were marked YES CVE but those were fixing NULL pointer dereferences with proper error handling **NO** This commit adds a new feature to support arbitrary hart indices as specified in the RISC-V APLIC specification. While it introduces device tree-based indexing that could theoretically be exploited with malicious device tree data, device trees are trusted boot-time data structures. The commit follows established patterns in interrupt controller drivers and doesn't fix an existing vulnerability. The lack of explicit bounds checking on `hart_index` is concerning but not sufficient to warrant a CVE for a feature addition that follows hardware specifications.
f9a5c4b6afc79 ASoC: rt722-sdca: Add some missing readable registers
- [sasha] **NO** This commit adds missing readable registers to the regmap configuration for the RT722 SDCA audio codec driver. The changes are purely functional additions to enable proper access to hardware registers that were previously not marked as readable. Analysis of the code changes: 1. The commit adds numerous register addresses to the `rt722_sdca_mbq_size()` function, which determines if registers are readable and their data size 2. All added registers are legitimate hardware control registers for audio functionality (mute controls, power states, sample frequency, volume controls) 3. Two new volatile register addresses (0x5810000, 0x6100060) are added to existing register ranges 4. The changes follow the same pattern as previous similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" This is a straightforward driver enhancement to expose missing hardware registers for proper operation. There are no security implications - these are hardware register definitions for an audio codec, not security-sensitive code paths. The commit does not fix any vulnerability, buffer overflow, access control issue, or other security concern.
3280c9313c9ad dm vdo: use a short static string for thread name prefix
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **No actual security vulnerability exists**: The code fixes a compiler warning about potential string truncation, but the truncation would never actually occur in practice. The buffer size is 16 bytes (TASK_COMM_LEN), and even with MODULE_NAME being "dm-vdo" (6 chars) plus a reasonable instance number, it would fit within the buffer. 2. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is very similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - particularly the mlx4, IPoIB, and mvpp2 commits that all fix format truncation compiler warnings by increasing buffer sizes or changing format strings. None of those were assigned CVEs. 3. **The fix is preventative, not corrective**: The change from `"%s%u", MODULE_NAME, instance` to `"vdo%u", instance` eliminates the theoretical possibility of truncation but doesn't fix an actual exploitable condition. The original code was functionally safe in practice. 4. **No memory corruption potential**: Even if truncation had occurred, snprintf() bounds the write to the buffer size, so there would be no buffer overflow or memory corruption - just a truncated string name. 5. **Limited impact scope**: Thread naming has no security implications - it's purely for debugging and process identification purposes. This is a code quality improvement that fixes a compiler warning, not a security fix warranting a CVE assignment.
7d92a38d67e5d ASoC: codecs: pcm3168a: Allow for 24-bit in provider mode
- [sasha] NO This commit is a feature enhancement that relaxes format restrictions rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The change allows 24-bit audio formats in provider mode for the PCM3168A audio codec, which was previously restricted. The code changes show: 1. **Function**: Audio format validation in `pcm3168a_hw_params()` at lines 496-499 2. **Change**: Modifies the conditional check from `if (provider_mode || ...)` to `if (!provider_mode && ...)`, allowing 24-bit formats in provider mode while maintaining restrictions in consumer mode with DSP formats 3. **Impact**: This is a configuration/capability expansion, not a security fix The commit message clearly states this is to align with codec device specifications, indicating it's a feature improvement rather than a vulnerability fix. Similar commits in the examples (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show comparable audio subsystem configuration changes that don't address security issues. There's no indication of buffer overflows, access control bypasses, or other security-relevant patterns that would warrant CVE assignment.
385a59e7f7fb3 arm64: zynqmp: add clock-output-names property in clock nodes
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes are purely cosmetic Device Tree Source (DTS) modifications with no security implications: **Rationale:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This is a maintenance commit that adds `clock-output-names` properties and renames clock nodes to comply with dt-schema rules. It does not fix any security issue. 2. **No Functional Changes**: The commit only affects device tree node naming and adds metadata properties. The actual clock functionality remains completely unchanged - the clocks work exactly the same before and after this change. 3. **No Security-Relevant Code Paths**: Device tree changes like this don't affect memory management, access control, input validation, privilege boundaries, or any other security-relevant code paths. 4. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Examples**: This commit follows the exact same pattern as the provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") - device tree schema compliance updates that are routine maintenance work. 5. **No Attack Vectors**: There are no possible attack vectors from: - Changing node names from `pss_ref_clk` to `pss-ref-clk` - Adding `clock-output-names = "pss_ref_clk"` properties - These changes only affect DT parsing and schema validation The commit message clearly states this is for schema compliance ("replace underscores with hyphens in the clock node names as per dt-schema rule") and clock name stability ("so that the resulting clock name do not change when clock node name is changed"). This is routine maintenance work to improve code standards compliance, not a security fix.
c81202906b5cd drm/ast: Find VBIOS mode from regular display size
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, this is a refactoring/correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit switches from using `mode->crtc_hdisplay/crtc_vdisplay` to `mode->hdisplay/vdisplay` for VBIOS mode lookup. This is a correctness fix to ensure the driver uses the intended display values rather than hardware-programmed values that may be affected by display settings like double-scan or interlace. 2. **No security implications**: The code changes show: - Simple field substitution in switch statements (lines 134, 147, 151, 155, 161, 167) - Addition of `adjusted_mode->crtc_hdisplay` and `adjusted_mode->crtc_vdisplay` assignments from VBIOS mode (lines 202, 212) - No bounds checking changes, buffer handling, or memory safety improvements 3. **Context from similar commits**: All provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" are similar refactoring/correctness fixes in DRM drivers, while the one "CVE Status: YES" commit fixes a clear programming error (checking pointer address instead of boolean value). 4. **Risk assessment**: The change addresses display mode lookup logic but doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, or other security-relevant patterns mentioned in the analysis criteria. This appears to be a display driver correctness improvement to ensure proper mode matching, not a security vulnerability fix.
8eccc58d71eaf scsi: lpfc: Reduce log message generation during ELS ring clean up
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with the similar commits provided, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a logging optimization that moves a vport check earlier in the loop to avoid generating unnecessary log messages. The security-critical logic (the actual vport check `if (piocb->vport != vport) continue;`) remains identical - it's just moved from after the logging to before the logging. 2. **No security impact**: - No memory safety issues are introduced or fixed - No access control changes are made - No privilege escalation or information disclosure vulnerabilities are addressed - The functional behavior of the ELS flush operation remains exactly the same 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: - This resembles "Similar Commit 5" (CVE Status: NO) which also involved log message changes for optimization purposes - Unlike "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 4" (CVE Status: YES), this doesn't fix any deadlocks, race conditions, or other security-critical bugs 4. **Commit message analysis**: The commit message explicitly states this is about reducing "log message generation" for performance reasons, not fixing any security vulnerability. The phrase "should only be generated for active I/Os matching the NPIV vport" indicates this is purely about log spam reduction. 5. **Code analysis**: The change simply moves the vport comparison check from line after `lpfc_printf_vlog()` to before it, and removes the `(piocb->vport == vport)` parameter from the log message since it's now guaranteed to be true. This is a pure optimization with no functional security impact. This is a code cleanup/optimization commit that improves logging efficiency but has no security implications.
268c73d470a57 wifi: ath12k: Avoid napi_sync() before napi_enable()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Bug Fix Nature**: The commit fixes a race condition that causes indefinite sleep/soft lockup rather than creating a security vulnerability. The issue occurs when `napi_synchronize()` is called before `napi_enable()`, leading to a hang rather than a security exploit. 2. **Limited Impact**: The vulnerability only affects system availability (causing hangs) during specific error conditions (MHI errors during firmware initialization). It does not provide privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure capabilities. 3. **Timing-Dependent**: The race condition only manifests during very specific timing scenarios involving firmware crashes in the QMI initialization sequence, making it more of a reliability issue than a security vulnerability. 4. **Similar Pattern Reference**: Looking at the historical similar commits, this follows the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a driver robustness fix addressing improper state management (similar to the soft lockup fix in Similar Commit 2). 5. **Code Analysis**: The changes introduce proper state tracking with the `napi_enabled` flag to prevent calling NAPI synchronization functions on uninitialized contexts. This is defensive programming to handle edge cases, not a security fix. The commit message clearly identifies this as avoiding "indefinite sleep" rather than fixing a security vulnerability, and the code changes are focused on state management rather than access control or memory safety.
f0842902b3839 scsi: lpfc: Free phba irq in lpfc_sli4_enable_msi() when pci_irq_vector() fails
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a resource leak but does not warrant a CVE assignment. The issue is a missing `free_irq()` call when `pci_irq_vector()` fails, which causes IRQ resources to remain allocated. While this is a bug that should be fixed, it's primarily a resource management issue rather than a security vulnerability. Key reasons this doesn't need a CVE: 1. **Limited security impact**: This is a resource leak, not a memory corruption or privilege escalation vulnerability 2. **High privilege requirement**: Exploiting this would require root-level access to repeatedly load/unload the driver 3. **Hardware-specific scope**: Only affects systems with LPFC HBA controllers 4. **Low exploitability**: Requires specific error conditions and hardware to manifest Comparing to the similar commits provided, this matches the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (like the HID and s390/pci commits) which fix resource management issues without significant security implications, rather than the "CVE Status: YES" commits which addressed more serious security issues like use-after-free vulnerabilities.
7081dc75df796 scsi: st: Restore some drive settings after reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit changes and the broader context from the kernel source tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: ## Analysis Summary **What the commit does:** - Adds two new fields (`changed_density`, `changed_blksize`) to persist user-requested tape drive settings across device resets - Automatically restores these settings after specific tape operations (MTREW, MTSEEK, MTEOM) that clear the device reset flag **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No New Attack Surface**: The commit doesn't create new permissions or bypass existing access controls. It only preserves settings that the user was already authorized to set through normal file descriptor access. 2. **Consistent with Existing Permission Model**: My analysis of the kernel source shows that `MTSETDENSITY` and `MTSETBLK` operations already require no special capabilities beyond file access permissions. The commit maintains this same permission model. 3. **Limited Scope**: The restored settings only affect tape drive configuration (density and block size), not system-level security settings or memory management. 4. **File-Level Protection Remains**: Access still requires appropriate permissions on the `/dev/st*` device files, which provides the primary access control mechanism. 5. **Functionality Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit message describes this as restoring expected functionality (preserving user settings after reset), not fixing a security issue. This aligns with similar commits in the reference examples that were marked "CVE Status: NO". **Comparison to Reference Commits:** This commit closely resembles the reference commits marked as "NO" - it's a functional improvement to device state management without introducing security vulnerabilities, similar to the tape driver fixes in the provided examples. The commit improves user experience by maintaining configured settings across device resets, which is expected behavior rather than a security concern.
56c3d809b7b45 scsi: lpfc: Handle duplicate D_IDs in ndlp search-by D_ID routine
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and similar historical commits, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Analysis of the Issue:** 1. **Nature of the Problem**: The issue addresses a race condition where multiple node list entries with the same fabric well-known address can exist temporarily after a port swap between separate fabrics. 2. **Root Cause**: This happens during fabric transitions when old nodes haven't been cleaned up yet (waiting for dev_loss_tmo expiration) while new nodes are being created. 3. **Impact**: The function could return stale fabric node objects instead of the correct newer ones, potentially causing operational issues. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES", this doesn't involve memory corruption, null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, or resource leaks. 2. **No Access Control Issues**: This doesn't involve privilege escalation, authentication bypass, or unauthorized access to resources. 3. **Operational Fix, Not Security Fix**: The change improves the correctness of node selection logic by preferring active nodes over unused ones, but doesn't fix a security flaw. 4. **Self-Resolving**: The commit message explicitly states this is a temporary condition that "eventually resolves itself after dev_loss_tmo expires." **Code Analysis:** The fix adds logic to: - Check if `ndlp->nlp_state != NLP_STE_UNUSED_NODE` - Return active nodes immediately - Only return unused nodes as a fallback if no active node is found This is a correctness improvement in node selection logic, not a security fix. The change ensures better operational behavior during fabric transitions but doesn't address any security vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access or system compromise.
5ec7e1c86c441 net/mana: fix warning in the writer of client oob
- [sasha] Now let me understand what this warning change actually does by analyzing the logic: ## Analysis **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit only modifies a `WARN_ON_ONCE()` condition from `(!pad_data || wqe_req->num_sge < 2)` to just `(wqe_req->num_sge < 2)`. This removes the `!pad_data` check from the warning condition. 2. **No security impact**: This is purely a diagnostic/warning fix. The change: - Does not fix any buffer overflow, memory corruption, or access control issue - Does not change any actual functional logic - only when a warning is printed - Does not prevent any vulnerability or attack vector - The underlying functionality remains exactly the same 3. **Context understanding**: Looking at the code, when `oob_in_sgl` is true, the original code would warn if either `pad_data` was false OR if `num_sge < 2`. The fix removes the `pad_data` check from the warning, indicating that it's actually valid to have `oob_in_sgl` true without `pad_data` being true. 4. **Similar commit patterns**: Looking at the reference commits, those marked as "CVE Status: NO" include similar diagnostic fixes (like memory leak fixes, warning fixes) while "CVE Status: YES" was for actual error handling that could be triggered maliciously. 5. **Commit message**: The commit message states "Do not warn on missing pad_data when oob is in sgl" - this is clearly about fixing an incorrect warning condition, not fixing a security vulnerability. This is a code quality improvement that removes a spurious warning, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
78d5d1e20d1de drm/xe/relay: Don't use GFP_KERNEL for new transactions
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and the context from the kernel tree, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **1. Nature of the Change:** This is a memory allocation flag change from `GFP_KERNEL` to `GFP_NOWAIT` for outgoing relay transactions in the xe GPU driver's SR-IOV virtual function (VF) communication system. **2. Security Analysis:** - **Not a vulnerability fix**: This addresses a deadlock/lockdep issue, not a security vulnerability - **No privilege escalation**: The change doesn't affect access controls or allow privilege escalation - **No buffer overflows**: No changes to buffer handling or memory bounds checking - **No memory corruption**: The allocation still happens through the same mempool, just with different flags **3. Technical Context:** - The issue is a lock ordering problem during VF resume/reset flows where `GFP_KERNEL` allocations can trigger memory reclaim that conflicts with held locks - The fix changes allocation behavior to `GFP_NOWAIT` to avoid triggering memory reclaim during this critical path - This uses an existing preallocated mempool, so the `GFP_NOWAIT` is safe since memory should already be available **4. Impact Assessment:** - **Availability improvement**: Fixes potential deadlocks during VF resume/reset - **No security boundary changes**: The communication channel and access controls remain unchanged - **Defensive programming**: Makes the allocation more robust in atomic contexts **5. Comparison with Historical CVEs:** Looking at the similar commits provided, this resembles "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 3" which were marked as NO for CVE assignment - both involved internal driver fixes that improved robustness without fixing security vulnerabilities. This is a stability/correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix, and therefore does not warrant CVE assignment.
23ed62897746f scsi: lpfc: Ignore ndlp rport mismatch in dev_loss_tmo callbk
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit provided: **CVE Status: YES** **Analysis:** This commit fixes a significant security vulnerability that could lead to use-after-free conditions. Here's why it warrants a CVE: 1. **Memory Safety Issue**: The code change adds a critical check `if (ndlp->rport != rport)` that prevents accessing stale/freed rport objects. Without this check, the function would proceed to: - Access `rport->dd_data` on potentially freed memory - Manipulate `ndlp->rport` references on mismatched objects - Potentially cause double-free scenarios through `lpfc_nlp_put(ndlp)` 2. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly describes a scenario where "ndlp reference confusion" occurs during fabric swaps. The older rport objects get freed while the callback still references them, creating classic use-after-free conditions. 3. **Attack Vector**: Fabric swaps between separate fabrics can be triggered through network configuration changes, potentially allowing an attacker with network access to trigger this vulnerability. 4. **Kernel Context**: This runs in kernel space with full privileges, making memory corruption particularly dangerous. 5. **Pattern Match with CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this follows the same pattern as commits that received CVE assignments - it prevents memory safety issues in the lpfc driver's rport handling. The fix prevents accessing stale rport objects that could lead to memory corruption, use-after-free, or other memory safety violations in kernel space.
ad6b5b73ff565 rcu: fix header guard for rcu_all_qs()
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this commit: **Analysis:** ## NO This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** This is a header guard fix that corrects a mismatch between function declaration and definition conditions, but it has no security implications: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit changes the conditional compilation guard for `rcu_all_qs()` declaration from `#ifndef CONFIG_PREEMPTION` to `#ifndef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU` to match how the function is actually defined in `tree_plugin.h:888`. 2. **Root cause**: With `CONFIG_PREEMPT_LAZY`, you can have `CONFIG_PREEMPTION=y` but `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=n`, creating a mismatch where the function is defined but not declared. 3. **Impact**: This is purely a compilation/build correctness issue. The function `rcu_all_qs()`: - Registers urgent quiescent states for RCU - Is only compiled when `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=n` (non-preemptible RCU) - Has no security-sensitive operations - it just updates RCU state tracking 4. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory corruption, or access control issues - No privilege escalation or information disclosure - No race conditions or memory safety issues - Simply fixes a header declaration to match implementation 5. **Similar pattern**: This matches the pattern of Similar Commits 1, 2, and 5 which were marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are build system fixes, code organization changes, or minor corrections without security impact. The fix ensures proper compilation in specific kernel configurations but introduces no functional changes that could affect system security.
8ce939a0fa194 perf: Avoid the read if the count is already updated
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the Linux kernel perf event subsystem, this commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **NO** This is a performance optimization, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why: **What the commit does:** - Adds a `skip_read` flag to avoid duplicate PMU register reads when event counts are already updated - Specifically targets Intel PEBS (Processor Event Based Sampling) scenarios where hardware automatically captures counter snapshots - When `PERF_SAMPLE_READ` is present, it sets `skip_read=1` to prevent redundant `perf_pmu_read()` calls **Why it's not a security issue:** 1. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit prevents redundant operations but doesn't fix any race conditions, information disclosure, or data corruption issues 2. **Hardware guarantees data consistency**: Intel PEBS provides atomic counter snapshots, so there's no timing window for exploitation 3. **No privilege or access control changes**: The optimization doesn't affect what data is accessible to users or change privilege boundaries 4. **Identical end result**: The final counter values and sample data remain the same - this only eliminates unnecessary register reads **Evidence from similar commits:** All 5 similar commits provided were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved performance optimizations, PMU handling improvements, or code cleanups rather than security fixes. The commit message explicitly states this is an optimization to "avoid the read" when values are "already updated" - classic performance optimization language rather than security fix terminology.
d67627e7b5320 ice: init flow director before RDMA
- [sasha] These files appear to be security analysis documents for various kernel components, which is legitimate security research work. I'll proceed with the analysis. **CVE Analysis:** **NO** This commit is a code reorganization change that reorders the initialization sequence to load flow director before RDMA initialization. The analysis shows: 1. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to "save MSI-X for" flow director by loading it before RDMA, which only needs one MSI-X vector. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Moves `ice_init_features(pf)` before `ice_init_rdma(pf)` in `ice_load()` - Updates error handling to call `ice_deinit_features(pf)` in the RDMA error path - Reorders `ice_deinit_rdma(pf)` and `ice_deinit_features(pf)` in `ice_unload()` to maintain proper cleanup order 3. **Security Assessment**: - This is purely an initialization order change for resource allocation optimization - No security-sensitive operations are modified - No access controls, memory safety, or privilege boundaries are affected - The functionality remains the same, just the order changes - Error handling is properly maintained 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: - All provided similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar driver initialization/cleanup changes - This follows the same pattern of infrastructure improvements without security implications This is a performance/resource optimization change that does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities.
d9e9f6d7b7d0c bridge: mdb: Allow replace of a host-joined group
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a minor functionality enhancement that allows the `replace` operation for host-joined multicast groups in bridge MDB (Multicast Database). Previously, attempting to replace a host-joined group would fail with -EEXIST, but now it succeeds when the NLM_F_REPLACE flag is set. 2. **Security impact**: The change has no security implications: - It only affects the behavior when the `NLM_F_REPLACE` netlink flag is explicitly set by userspace - The underlying functionality (`br_multicast_host_join()`) was already available and safe - it only refreshes a timer and potentially sends a notification - No new attack vectors are created - No privilege escalation opportunities are introduced - No memory safety issues are involved 3. **Code analysis**: The change is a simple condition check addition: ```c // Before: if (mp->host_joined) // After: if (mp->host_joined && !(cfg->nlflags & NLM_F_REPLACE)) ``` This just allows the operation to proceed when replace flag is set, calling the same safe `br_multicast_host_join()` function that only updates a timer (`mod_timer(&mp->timer, jiffies + brmctx->multicast_membership_interval)`). 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits that received CVEs involved race conditions, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities. This commit is more similar to the "NO" examples that are simple functionality improvements without security implications. 5. **Intent**: This is clearly a usability improvement to make the replace operation consistent between port members and host members, not a security fix.
cbe08724c1807 net: flush_backlog() small changes
- [sasha] The directory contains security analysis files, which appears to be legitimate security research work. Let me analyze the commit based on the information provided. Looking at the commit changes and comparing with the similar commits: **Analysis of the commit:** 1. **Subject**: "net: flush_backlog() small changes" - This indicates network improvements, not a security fix 2. **Code changes**: - Adds `READ_ONCE()` around `skb->dev->reg_state` reads for race condition protection - Changes from calling `dev_kfree_skb_irq()` and `kfree_skb()` while holding locks to using a temporary list and `__skb_queue_purge_reason()` - Adds `SKB_DROP_REASON_DEV_READY` drop reason for better debugging 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: - This commit is very similar to the "NO" CVE commits that add `READ_ONCE()`/`WRITE_ONCE()` annotations - Similar commits 1-4 all had "CVE Status: NO" and involved adding memory access annotations to prevent race conditions and KCSAN warnings - The similar commits were described as "benign races" and "aimed at reducing the number of benign races reported by KCSAN" 4. **Security implications**: - The `READ_ONCE()` additions are to prevent load/store tearing and KCSAN warnings, not to fix exploitable vulnerabilities - The refactoring of memory management (using temporary list) is for performance/correctness, not security - No buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or memory corruption fixes are indicated **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE. It implements performance optimizations and race condition annotations similar to the reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO". The changes address benign data races and improve code organization rather than fixing exploitable security vulnerabilities. The `READ_ONCE()` additions are defensive programming practices to prevent theoretical race conditions, not fixes for actual security flaws.
c3a392bdd31ad ice: count combined queues using Rx/Tx count
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the surrounding code context, here is my determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary ### Code Changes The commit changes the queue counting logic in `ice_get_combined_cnt()` from: - **Old**: `if (q_vector->rx.rx_ring && q_vector->tx.tx_ring) combined++;` - **New**: `combined += min(q_vector->num_ring_tx, q_vector->num_ring_rx);` ### Why This is NOT a Security Vulnerability 1. **No Buffer Overflow Risk**: The function `ice_get_combined_cnt()` returns a count that's used for ethtool reporting and queue reconfiguration. The values are properly bounds-checked in `ice_set_channels()` at lines 3946-3965, which validate against maximum queue limits using `ice_get_max_rxq(pf)` and `ice_get_max_txq(pf)`. 2. **Arithmetic Bounds Are Safe**: - `num_ring_tx` and `num_ring_rx` are `u8` types (0-255 max) - The `min()` operation returns values ≤ 255 - The summation uses `u32` preventing overflow - Hardware limits (like `ICE_MAX_RXQS_PER_TC = 256`) keep values reasonable 3. **Integer Underflow Protection**: While `ch->rx_count = vsi->num_rxq - ch->combined_count` could theoretically underflow, this is: - A reporting function to userspace (ethtool), not used for memory allocation - Protected by validation logic in `ice_set_channels()` that ensures proper bounds - The counts are derived from the same VSI structure, so they should be consistent 4. **Functional Fix, Not Security Fix**: The commit message indicates this fixes an incorrect assumption about 1:1 matching between vectors and queues. This is a correctness improvement to handle asymmetric queue configurations properly. 5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar commits marked "NO" deal with queue counting, array sizing, and mapping fixes - The "YES" commit dealt with actual memory corruption and kernel NULL pointer dereference - This commit follows the pattern of correctness improvements rather than security fixes ### Conclusion This is a functional correctness fix that improves queue counting accuracy for ethtool reporting. It does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability, has proper bounds checking in the usage paths, and follows safe arithmetic practices. The change improves the driver's handling of asymmetric queue configurations without creating security risks.
faac69a4ae5ab r8169: don't scan PHY addresses > 0
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, along with examination of the kernel source tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Hardware Design Limitation, Not Vulnerability**: The commit addresses a hardware design characteristic where r8169 PHY access registers don't support PHY addresses > 0. The change adds `new_bus->phy_mask = GENMASK(31, 1);` to prevent scanning of non-existent PHY addresses (1-31). 2. **No Security Impact**: The hardware correctly returns `-ENODEV` for invalid PHY addresses rather than exposing sensitive information or causing system instability. This is a controlled failure mode, not a security flaw. 3. **Optimization, Not Security Fix**: The commit eliminates 31 unnecessary failed MDIO transactions during driver initialization. This is purely a performance and correctness optimization to align driver behavior with hardware capabilities. 4. **Similar Patterns Elsewhere**: The same `phy_mask` pattern is used in other network drivers (like txgbe) for identical hardware limitations, indicating this is a standard optimization practice rather than a security fix. 5. **No Exploitable Vulnerability**: There's no evidence of buffer overflows, information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other exploitable conditions that would warrant CVE assignment. The change represents good defensive programming by ensuring the driver only attempts operations the hardware supports, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability.
689805dcc474c net/mlx5e: Avoid WARN_ON when configuring MQPRIO with HTB offload enabled
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit more thoroughly: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit addresses a purely operational issue in the MLX5 network driver, not a security vulnerability. Here's why it doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The change replaces `WARN_ON()` with proper error handling when a user attempts to configure MQPRIO while HTB offload is already enabled. This is a configuration conflict, not a security issue. 2. **User-Triggered, Expected Behavior**: The condition being checked (`mlx5e_selq_is_htb_enabled(&priv->selq)`) is a legitimate configuration state that can occur through normal user operations. The original code correctly returned `-EINVAL` but also triggered an unnecessary kernel warning. 3. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The code change doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues. It simply improves error handling and user experience. 4. **WARN_ON Removal for UX, Not Security**: The `WARN_ON()` was generating call traces for what is essentially a user configuration error. Replacing it with `NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD()` and returning `-EOPNOTSUPP` provides better user feedback without the kernel warning spam. 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples provided, this follows the same pattern as other "NO CVE" commits that fix operational issues, improve error handling, or clean up unnecessary warnings without addressing security vulnerabilities. The change from `drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_main.c:3799,42` shows this is purely about replacing harsh kernel warnings with appropriate user-facing error messages for configuration conflicts.
f6205f8215f12 vxlan: Annotate FDB data races
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Key Findings: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a data race around timestamp fields (`used` and `updated`) in the VXLAN FDB (Forwarding Database) entries. These fields track when entries were last used/updated for cache management purposes. 2. **Security Impact Assessment**: - **No memory corruption**: The race involves atomic timestamp updates, not corruption of critical data structures - **No privilege escalation**: The race doesn't affect access controls or security boundaries - **No information disclosure**: The race doesn't expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties - **No denial of service**: While there might be minor performance impact from cache line bouncing, it doesn't cause system crashes or unavailability 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: - This closely resembles Similar Commits 3, 4, and 5 (all marked "CVE Status: NO") - Similar Commit 3 (wireguard) also involves intentional data races in queue checking - marked NO - Similar Commit 4 (netlink) involves data races around `sk->sk_err` - marked NO - Similar Commit 5 (wireguard) involves CPU round-robin data races - marked NO 4. **Technical Analysis**: - The changes only add `READ_ONCE()`/`WRITE_ONCE()` annotations around timestamp fields - No functional logic changes - The race is benign - worst case is unnecessary timestamp updates - KCSAN reports are for concurrency debugging, not security vulnerabilities 5. **Context**: The `used` and `updated` fields in `struct vxlan_fdb` are `unsigned long` timestamp values (jiffies) used for FDB entry aging and management - not security-critical data. This is a code quality/performance improvement to suppress KCSAN warnings about intentional data races, similar to the other "NO" cases in the reference commits. It does not fix a security vulnerability.
7e8b24e24ac46 tools: ynl-gen: don't output external constants
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code generation improvement in a development tool (YNL code generator), not a fix for a runtime security vulnerability. The change prevents duplicate constant definitions by skipping constants that have a "header" property (indicating they're already defined in external headers). 2. **Security impact**: While duplicate symbol definitions could theoretically cause compilation issues or non-deterministic behavior, this doesn't constitute a security vulnerability. The issue is: - Limited to build/development time, not runtime - Doesn't involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure - Cannot be exploited to compromise system security 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: The provided reference commits all have "CVE Status: NO" and represent similar code quality improvements (Makefile fixes, documentation updates, code organization) rather than security fixes. 4. **Tool vs. kernel code**: This affects a userspace development tool (`tools/net/ynl/pyynl/ynl_gen_c.py`) rather than kernel code that could impact system security. The change represents good development practices by ensuring clean symbol namespaces and preventing potential build conflicts, but it doesn't address an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
2c1268e7aad08 drm/rockchip: vop2: Improve display modes handling on RK3588 HDMI0
- [sasha] **CVE STATUS: NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is an improvement/enhancement rather than a security vulnerability fix. The commit message explicitly states it's about "improving display modes handling" to support more display modes and refresh rates. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Adds new clock handling (`dclk_src`, `pll_hdmiphy0`) to improve display mode support - Introduces clock source switching logic for HDMI0 PHY PLL - Adds proper cleanup in `vop2_crtc_atomic_disable()` - All changes are additive and improve functionality 3. **No Security Implications**: - No memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No access control violations - No privilege escalation concerns - No input validation security issues - No race conditions or concurrency issues 4. **No "Fixes" Tag**: The commit does not contain a "Fixes:" tag, indicating it's not fixing a known bug but rather adding new functionality. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also feature improvements or hardware limitation fixes, similar to this commit. 6. **Functionality Focus**: The changes are purely about expanding hardware capability support for different display modes and refresh rates - this is a feature enhancement, not a security fix. This commit improves display driver functionality but introduces no security vulnerabilities or fixes any existing security issues.
2f4204bb00b32 media: qcom: camss: Add default case in vfe_src_pad_code
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit only adds a default case to a switch statement that handles different hardware versions. The added code simply: - Prints a warning message with `WARN(1, "Unsupported HW version: %x\n", vfe->camss->res->version)` - Executes a `break` statement - Falls through to `return 0` 2. **No Security Impact**: - This is purely a defensive programming improvement to handle unexpected hardware versions - The function was already returning 0 at the end for unhandled cases - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure is possible - No change in actual functionality - the same return value (0) is provided 3. **Compiler Warning Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "get rid of a compile warning if a new hw enum is added" - this is a code quality improvement, not a security fix 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, all the "CVE Status: NO" commits are similar in nature: - Code style fixes (Similar Commit 1, 3) - Adding error checking for robustness (Similar Commit 2) - Fixing unused variable warnings (Similar Commit 4) - Code simplification (Similar Commit 5) 5. **Function Behavior**: The `vfe_src_pad_code` function processes media format codes. Before the fix, an unsupported hardware version would silently fall through and return 0. After the fix, it logs a warning and still returns 0. No security boundary is crossed. This is a classic defensive programming improvement that enhances code maintainability and debugging capability without fixing any actual vulnerability.
09717c28b76c3 eth: fbnic: set IFF_UNICAST_FLT to avoid enabling promiscuous mode when adding unicast addrs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The issue is that the fbnic driver was missing the `IFF_UNICAST_FLT` flag, causing the kernel networking core to unnecessarily enable promiscuous mode when adding unicast addresses. This is a functional oversight in driver implementation rather than a security vulnerability. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While promiscuous mode does have security implications (increased attack surface, potential data exposure), this specific case: - Only affects the relatively new Meta fbnic driver with limited deployment - Is triggered by normal network configuration operations (adding unicast addresses) - Does not enable direct exploitation for privilege escalation or remote code execution - Is limited to local network segment traffic exposure 3. **Design Intent vs Implementation Bug**: The code change `netdev->priv_flags |= IFF_UNICAST_FLT;` simply tells the kernel that the driver supports unicast filtering, which prevents the automatic fallback to promiscuous mode. This is correcting the driver's capability declaration rather than fixing a vulnerability. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: YES" involved buffer overflows and stack corruption - direct memory safety issues. This commit is more similar to the network configuration fixes marked "CVE Status: NO". 5. **Root Cause Analysis**: The kernel networking core in `net/core/dev.c` automatically enables promiscuous mode for drivers that don't declare unicast filtering capability. The fbnic driver simply forgot to set this flag, causing incorrect behavior rather than introducing a security flaw. This is better classified as a functional improvement that enhances security posture by ensuring proper network isolation, but it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment.
8a734b9359cfa drm/xe: Fix PVC RPe and RPa information
- [sasha] Now let me understand the specific changes in the commit. Based on my analysis: ## Analysis: **Commit Summary**: This commit fixes incorrect register field masks used for reading RPe (efficient frequency) and RPa (aggressive frequency) values specifically for Intel PVC (Ponte Vecchio) hardware. **Code Changes Analysis**: 1. **Comment Fix**: The commit corrects a copy-paste error in comments - changing "RPe" to "RPa" in the RPA function comment. 2. **Register Field Mask Changes for PVC**: - For `tgl_update_rpa_value()`: Changed from using `RPA_MASK` to `RP0_MASK` when reading from `PVC_RP_STATE_CAP` register - For `tgl_update_rpe_value()`: Changed from using `RPE_MASK` to `RP1_MASK` when reading from `PVC_RP_STATE_CAP` register 3. **Logic Structure**: Added proper conditional branching to use different register field masks for PVC vs other platforms. **Security Assessment**: This is a hardware register field mask correction for GPU frequency management. The changes: - Fix incorrect bit field extraction from hardware registers - Affect GPU power/frequency management functionality - Are specific to hardware register reading operations - Do not involve memory management, access control, privilege escalation, or input validation - Do not create buffer overflows or race conditions - Are purely corrective changes to existing hardware interface code The commit addresses a functional bug in hardware register field interpretation, not a security vulnerability. This is similar to the reference commits which were all marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved register definition corrections, workarounds, and hardware interface fixes. **NO** This commit fixes incorrect register field masks for reading GPU frequency values on PVC hardware. It's a straightforward hardware interface correction that affects power management functionality but has no security implications. The changes only involve correcting which bit fields are extracted from hardware registers (RP0_MASK vs RPA_MASK, RP1_MASK vs RPE_MASK), which is a functional fix rather than a security issue.
8df0f002827e1 hwmon: (xgene-hwmon) use appropriate type for the latency value
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have all the information I need to analyze this commit. ## Analysis **NO** This commit changes a data type to fix a precision mismatch but does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Issue being fixed**: The commit changes `usecs_lat` from `u64` to `unsigned int` to match the expected input type of `usecs_to_jiffies()`, which takes `const unsigned int u`. 2. **Technical details**: - `pcc_chan->latency` is `u32` (from `/home/sasha/linux/include/acpi/pcc.h:17`) - `PCC_NUM_RETRIES` is `500` (a small constant) - The calculation `PCC_NUM_RETRIES amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md pcc_chan->latency` fits comfortably in a `u32` - `usecs_to_jiffies()` expects `unsigned int` input, not `u64` 3. **Not a security issue**: This is a data type optimization/correction that: - Fixes type mismatch between variable and function parameter - Reduces memory usage (8 bytes → 4 bytes) - Does not fix any vulnerability like buffer overflow, privilege escalation, or memory corruption - Does not affect access control or input validation - The original code worked correctly but used wider-than-necessary storage 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar code quality improvements that fix arithmetic precision, type mismatches, or minor calculation errors without security implications. This is a code quality improvement that makes the data type more appropriate for its usage, not a security fix warranting a CVE.
c1e00bc4be06c net: page_pool: avoid false positive warning if NAPI was never added
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit addresses a false positive warning issue rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: **Rationale:** 1. **Warning Logic Improvement Only**: The commit replaces direct `WARN_ON` checks with a new function `napi_assert_will_not_race()` that first checks if NAPI is uninitialized (`!napi->poll_list.next`) and returns early if so. This is purely about eliminating false positive warnings. 2. **No Security Impact**: The changes don't fix any memory corruption, race conditions, privilege escalation, or other security issues. The underlying page pool functionality remains exactly the same - it just avoids warning when NAPI was never initialized, which the commit message explicitly states is "legal." 3. **Pattern Comparison**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference: - CVE Status: YES commits fix actual crashes/panics (like the MANA NAPI cleanup issues) - CVE Status: NO commits fix non-security issues like caching problems or warning logic 4. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way this change could be exploited for malicious purposes. It only affects debug output when a legitimate code path (uninitialized NAPI) is taken. 5. **Explicit Intent**: The commit message clearly states this is to "avoid false positive warning" - indicating a debugging/quality improvement rather than a security fix. This falls into the same category as the page_pool commits that received "CVE Status: NO" - it's a quality improvement without security implications.
285b3f78eabd9 netdevsim: allow normal queue reset while down
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual security implications by looking at the specific changes to nsim_queue_mem_alloc: **CVE Status: NO** This commit does not introduce a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit removes a restriction that prevented queue resets when the network interface is down, allowing normal queue management operations even when the device is not running. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - **Removal of restrictive check**: The main change removes the `if (!netif_running(ns->netdev))` check from `nsim_qreset_write()` that was unconditionally returning `-ENETDOWN` - **Addition of specific mode check**: For mode 1 specifically, it adds a check `if (!netif_running(ns->netdev)) return -ENETDOWN;` in `nsim_queue_mem_alloc()` - **Proper error handling**: The core netdev_rx_queue_restart function in `/home/sasha/linux/net/core/netdev_rx_queue.c:43-53` already has proper handling for when the device is down vs running 3. **Security implications**: - **No privilege escalation**: The operation still requires the same privileges and locking (rtnl_lock) - **No memory safety issues**: The core function properly handles both running and non-running states with appropriate memory management - **No race conditions introduced**: The locking mechanism remains the same - **Limited scope**: This only affects the netdevsim test driver, not production network drivers 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: This is similar to commit "Similar Commit 1" which had CVE Status: NO - both involve removing overly restrictive warnings/checks that don't represent actual security issues. The commit enhances functionality by allowing legitimate queue reset operations when the interface is down, which is a normal administrative operation that should be permitted. No security boundaries are violated.
52b10b591f83d clk: qcom: camcc-sm8250: Use clk_rcg2_shared_ops for some RCGs
- [sasha] Now let me look at the commit message again and understand if this is fixing a vulnerability or just a robustness issue: Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit is changing Root Clock Generator (RCG) operations from `clk_rcg2_ops` to `clk_rcg2_shared_ops` for multiple camera clocks in the SM8250 platform. The key difference is: 1. **Standard `clk_rcg2_ops`**: Simply disables clocks without specific parking behavior 2. **`clk_rcg2_shared_ops`**: Parks RCGs to a safe XO (crystal oscillator) source during disable to prevent clock lock-ups when the GDSC (voltage domain) is enabled **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Robustness fix, not security fix**: This prevents clocks from getting "stuck" and voltage domains (GDSC) from getting "wedged" - these are functional/reliability issues, not security issues. 2. **No privilege boundaries crossed**: The issue affects hardware clock management within the same privilege domain. There's no escalation of privileges or unauthorized access. 3. **Hardware reliability pattern**: Similar to all the provided reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO", this follows the exact same pattern of switching to `shared_ops` for proper RCG parking. 4. **Consistent with historical decisions**: All 5 similar commits provided as examples were marked as not requiring CVEs, and this commit follows the identical pattern. 5. **No attack surface**: Clock parking is a hardware management operation that doesn't create attack vectors or expose sensitive data. This is a hardware robustness improvement to prevent system hangs, not a security vulnerability fix.
8ab67b37b81df iio: dac: adi-axi-dac: add bus mode setup
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Feature Addition, Not Vulnerability Fix**: This commit adds new functionality to support different bus modes (SPI, DSPI, QSPI) for the ad354xr DAC. It's an enhancement to enable proper operation in buffering mode, not a fix for a security vulnerability. 2. **No Security-Related Changes**: The code changes involve: - Adding a new enum for IO modes - Adding a new function `axi_dac_bus_set_io_mode()` with proper mutex protection - Replacing an unused bit field definition (`AXI_DAC_CUSTOM_CTRL_SYNCED_TRANSFER`) with a new multi-bit field (`AXI_DAC_CUSTOM_CTRL_MULTI_IO_MODE`) - Adding the new function to the platform data structure 3. **Proper Implementation**: The new function includes: - Mutex protection (`guard(mutex)(&st->lock)`) - Proper error handling - Safe register operations using `regmap_update_bits()` - Polling for completion with timeout 4. **Hardware Configuration Change**: The commit message clearly states this is about configuring hardware modes for different DAC types, and removing a flag that "has never been used" according to HDL documentation. 5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the provided reference commits which were all marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are driver improvements, configuration fixes, or feature additions rather than security vulnerability fixes. The commit enhances functionality without introducing or fixing any security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
21889245fb538 iio: dac: ad3552r-hs: use instruction mode for configuration
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the current commit for security implications: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is about using "instruction mode" for configuration operations to make them "more safely done" - but this refers to operational safety/correctness, not security vulnerability mitigation. 2. **Code Analysis**: The changes involve: - Setting `AD3552R_MASK_SINGLE_INST` bit to enable instruction mode during setup - Adding proper error handling paths with `exit_err_ddr` label - Switching between streaming and instruction modes appropriately - No memory bounds checking, access control, or privilege-related changes 3. **No "Fixes:" Tag**: Unlike the related commit 012b8276f08a which has a "Fixes:" tag indicating it fixes a bug, this commit lacks such indication and appears to be an enhancement. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked CVE Status: NO) involve configuration fixes, register corrections, and operational improvements - none address security vulnerabilities. This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **Driver Context**: This is an IIO (Industrial I/O) DAC driver for hardware configuration, which typically runs in kernel space with appropriate privileges already established. The commit improves the robustness of hardware initialization by using the proper operational mode, but does not fix any security vulnerability that could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise.
d078f5857a00c wifi: rtw89: call power_on ahead before selecting firmware
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information and similar commits. Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit is a refactoring change that reorganizes the initialization flow for RTW89 WiFi drivers. The key changes are: 1. **Code reorganization, not a security fix**: The commit moves `rtw89_mac_pwr_on()` calls to occur earlier in the initialization sequence, before firmware selection. This is done to resolve a flow problem where certain chips (RTL8851B) need to read hardware version from efuse during power_on, but the current flow does power_on after selecting firmware. 2. **No security implications indicated**: - The commit message describes this as resolving a "flow problem" for proper hardware version reading - No mention of security vulnerabilities, crashes, or potential exploits - The changes are structural reorganization of existing functionality 3. **Pattern analysis from similar commits**: - Similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" include other RTW89 driver improvements like firmware loading retries, power management changes, and initialization flow modifications - The one commit marked "CVE Status: YES" was fixing a UAF (Use-After-Free) vulnerability with specific security implications 4. **Code changes examination**: - `rtw89_mac_pwr_on()` is moved from inside `rtw89_mac_partial_init()` to be called separately before firmware operations - Error handling paths are properly maintained with `rtw89_mac_pwr_off()` calls - No changes to memory management, access controls, or input validation that would suggest security fixes This appears to be a legitimate driver improvement to fix initialization ordering issues, not a security vulnerability fix.
1f0efffd59789 wifi: rtw89: fw: validate multi-firmware header before accessing
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. The code changes fix critical buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the RTW89 wireless driver's firmware parsing code. **Key security issues addressed:** 1. **Buffer overflow prevention**: The commit adds `rtw89_mfw_validate_hdr()` which validates that the multi-firmware header array (`&mfw_hdr->info[fw_nr]`) doesn't exceed the firmware file boundaries (`ptr > mfw + mfw_len`). 2. **Out-of-bounds access protection**: In the `found:` section, it adds validation that the firmware content (`fw_suit->data + fw_suit->size`) doesn't extend beyond the file size (`> mfw + mfw_len`). 3. **Untrusted loop bound mitigation**: The Coverity warning "Untrusted loop bound" indicates that `mfw_hdr->fw_nr` comes from untrusted firmware file data and could be maliciously crafted to cause array access beyond allocated memory. **Security impact:** - **Attack vector**: Malicious firmware files with crafted headers could trigger buffer overflows - **Consequence**: Potential kernel memory corruption, privilege escalation, or system crashes - **Scope**: Affects RTW89 wireless chipset users who load firmware The validation checks prevent reading beyond allocated buffers when parsing firmware headers, which is a classic security vulnerability pattern similar to the buffer overflow fixes in the reference CVE examples.
2b8bdc5237014 wifi: rtw89: fw: validate multi-firmware header before getting its size
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and the security vulnerability it addresses, here is my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Security Vulnerability Analysis **1. Critical Memory Safety Issue**: The original code had an "untrusted array index read" vulnerability (Coverity ID 1544385) in the line: ```c mfw_info = &mfw_hdr->info[mfw_hdr->fw_nr - 1]; ``` **2. Untrusted Input Source**: The `fw_nr` value comes directly from firmware file data without validation, making it an untrusted input that could be controlled by an attacker. **3. Multiple Attack Vectors**: - **Integer Underflow**: If `fw_nr = 0`, then `fw_nr - 1 = 0xFFFFFFFF`, causing massive out-of-bounds array access - **Buffer Overflow**: If `fw_nr` is too large, it accesses beyond the allocated `info[]` array - **Arbitrary Memory Access**: Attackers can craft malicious firmware files to read arbitrary kernel memory **4. Real-World Exploitability**: - Firmware files are external inputs that attackers can potentially place or modify - The vulnerability occurs during firmware loading, a common operation - Could lead to information disclosure or system crashes **5. Security-Critical Component**: This affects wireless firmware parsing in kernel space, where memory safety bugs can have severe consequences. **6. Comparison to Similar CVE-Assigned Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this shares characteristics with commits marked "CVE Status: YES" - specifically out-of-bounds memory access vulnerabilities in wireless drivers. The fix properly validates the firmware header before using `fw_nr` as an array index, preventing both underflow and overflow conditions. This is a classic memory safety vulnerability that should receive CVE assignment.
2e4c4717b3f6f wifi: rtw89: coex: Assign value over than 0 to avoid firmware timer hang
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: **Analysis of the Issue:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit changes four slot duration values from 0 to 5 in static configuration arrays (`CXST_E2G`, `CXST_E5G`, `CXST_ENULL`) 2. **Impact**: Prevents firmware timer hangs during initialization due to zero duration values triggering a hardware algorithm edge case 3. **Scope**: Limited to Wi-Fi coexistence timer configuration in Realtek RTW89 wireless drivers **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No security implications**: This is a firmware stability/reliability issue, not a security flaw. Timer hangs would cause device malfunction, not privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts 2. **Hardware-specific bug**: The issue is confined to specific hardware timer behavior during low-rate conditions - it's a device driver robustness fix 3. **No external attack vector**: The hang occurs due to internal firmware timer initialization, not due to external input or malicious data 4. **Configuration fix**: Simply adjusting static configuration values to avoid a problematic hardware state **Comparison with similar commits:** - Similar Commit 3: Also marked "CVE Status: NO" for removing unused/problematic code paths in the same driver - Similar Commit 4: Also marked "CVE Status: NO" for fixing debug timing calculations in the same driver - Similar Commit 5: Also marked "CVE Status: NO" for PCI compatibility improvements This aligns with the pattern that driver reliability and hardware compatibility fixes in this codebase are typically not security-relevant.
8425f5c8f04db wifi: rtw88: Fix __rtw_download_firmware() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can provide a definitive answer: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Bug Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a compatibility issue specific to the RTL8814AU chipset, not a security vulnerability. The change prevents calling LTE coexistence functions when the hardware doesn't support this feature. 2. **Null Pointer Check, Not Buffer Overflow**: The fix adds proper null checks (`rtwdev->chip->ltecoex_addr`) before calling `ltecoex_read_reg()` and `ltecoex_reg_write()`. This prevents potential null pointer dereferences but doesn't address buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other security-relevant issues. 3. **Hardware Compatibility Issue**: The commit message explicitly states this is about RTL8814AU not having the LTE coexistence feature. This is a functional compatibility fix, not a security patch. 4. **No Security Impact**: - The change doesn't involve input validation, bounds checking, or memory safety - No user-controlled data is being processed differently - No privilege boundaries are being crossed - The fix prevents a functional error, not an exploitable condition 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" deal with similar functional fixes rather than security vulnerabilities, which aligns with this commit's nature. The code changes show defensive programming to handle hardware variations properly, which is good practice but doesn't constitute a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
9e8243025cc06 wifi: rtw88: Fix download_firmware_validate() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual code changes and their security implications: **NO** This commit is a hardware compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The code changes show: 1. **What changed**: The fix adds `BIT_CPU_CLK_SEL` definition for bits 12-13 and excludes these bits from `FW_READY_MASK` by changing it from `0xffff` to `(0xffff & ~BIT_CPU_CLK_SEL)`. 2. **Why this is not a security issue**: - The RTL8814AU power-on sequence legitimately sets bits 13 and 12 to value 2, which is hardware-specific behavior - The firmware validation was incorrectly interpreting these hardware status bits as firmware validation failure - This is a false positive in firmware validation, not a bypass of security checks 3. **Impact**: Without this fix, the driver would incorrectly reject valid firmware on RTL8814AU devices, causing the device to fail initialization. This is a functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. 4. **No security implications**: The validation logic still properly checks all the security-relevant bits (firmware ready, checksum OK, memory download OK, etc.). The excluded bits are purely hardware clock selection status bits that don't affect security validation. The commit title "Fix download_firmware_validate()" and the technical nature of excluding hardware-specific status bits from validation clearly indicate this is a compatibility fix rather than a security patch.
8f0076726b66a wifi: rtw88: Extend rtw_fw_send_ra_info() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if it represents a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **NO** This commit is a feature enhancement, not a security fix. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** - Extends existing firmware communication to support RTL8814AU chips with 3 spatial streams - Adds a new H2C command `H2C_CMD_RA_INFO_HI` to send the upper 32 bits of the rate adaptation mask - Adds chip type `RTW_CHIP_TYPE_8814A` to identify the new hardware **Why this doesn't warrant a CVE:** 1. **Feature Addition, Not Vulnerability Fix**: This commit adds new functionality rather than fixing a security issue. The commit message clearly indicates it's extending support for a new chip variant. 2. **Follows Existing Patterns**: The code follows the same pattern as existing H2C command handling. It uses the same validation mechanisms and packet construction methods as the original function. 3. **No Security-Related Language**: Unlike the similar commits that were assigned CVE status (which contained language about "fixes," "security," or error conditions), this commit focuses on "extending" and "informing firmware about rates." 4. **Bounded Operations**: The new code performs bounded operations on well-defined data structures (`si->ra_mask >> 32`) and uses existing validated macros for packet construction. 5. **Controlled Execution Path**: The new code only executes for a specific chip type (`RTW_CHIP_TYPE_8814A`) and follows the same security model as existing code. This is a straightforward hardware support extension that doesn't introduce or fix security vulnerabilities, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
17207d0bb209e ext4: remove writable userspace mappings before truncating page cache
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and the detailed security analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Security Impact Analysis **This is a data integrity vulnerability with serious security implications:** 1. **Silent Data Loss**: The vulnerability causes memory-mapped writes to be permanently lost without any error indication. The commit message demonstrates clear evidence: - Data written via `mwrite -S 0x59 2048 2048` appears correct initially - After remount, this data is completely lost (shows as zeros) - Applications have no way to detect this data loss 2. **Race Condition in Security-Critical Code**: The root cause is a race condition in page cache management where writable userspace mappings aren't removed before truncating the page cache. This prevents `ext4_page_mkwrite()` from being called on subsequent writes. 3. **Wide Attack Surface**: - Affects all ext4 filesystems with block size < page size (very common: 1KB/2KB blocks) - Exploitable via standard filesystem operations (`mmap`, `fallocate`, etc.) - No special privileges required ## Code Changes Show Clear Security Fix The code changes implement specific security controls: ```c // New security function to remove writable mappings static inline void ext4_truncate_folio(struct inode *inode, loff_t start, loff_t end) { // ... if (folio_mkclean(folio)) // Critical security control folio_mark_dirty(folio); // ... } ``` The `folio_mkclean()` call is the key security fix - it removes writable userspace mappings to ensure proper page fault handling. ## Comparison with Historical CVEs This is similar to other ext4 data corruption vulnerabilities that received CVEs: - **CVE-2012-4508**: ext4 stale data exposure - Multiple other ext4 data integrity issues have been assigned CVEs ## Severity Assessment - **Integrity Impact**: High (silent data corruption) - **Confidentiality Impact**: Medium (intended-to-be-zeroed data remains accessible) - **Availability Impact**: Medium (application failures from data loss) This represents a serious filesystem security vulnerability that enables silent data corruption, which is a classic security issue warranting CVE assignment.
43d0105e2c752 ext4: don't write back data before punch hole in nojournal mode
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, here is my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a legitimate data integrity vulnerability in ext4's punch hole implementation. **Key security issues addressed:** 1. **Race condition fix**: The original code had a dangerous race window where `filemap_write_and_wait_range()` would write back data that was immediately invalidated by `truncate_pagecache_range()`, potentially leading to inconsistent filesystem state and data exposure. 2. **Data exposure risk**: In nojournal mode, the write-back-then-invalidate pattern could expose stale data if the system crashed between the write-back and the space deallocation, as mentioned in the commit message: "could expose old, stale data, even if synchronization has been performed." 3. **Improper page cache handling**: The replacement of `truncate_pagecache_range()` with `ext4_truncate_page_cache_block_range()` provides proper ext4-specific handling that addresses partial page/block scenarios more securely. 4. **Memory mapping vulnerability**: The commit specifically mentions addressing "partially punched folios when block size < page size" and removing "writable userspace mappings," which are classic indicators of memory mapping security issues. While this commit does provide performance improvements, the primary motivation is clearly security-focused - fixing data integrity issues that could lead to information disclosure. The pattern matches other known ext4 vulnerabilities related to data exposure during truncation operations.
c629c972b310a leds: trigger: netdev: Configure LED blink interval for HW offload
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. After analyzing the code changes and examining the kernel source, this is clearly a **feature enhancement** rather than a security fix. **Key reasons:** 1. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message describes adding new functionality ("Configure LED blink interval for HW offload") rather than fixing any security issue. 2. **Safe code changes**: - Adds a simple `unsigned long blink_delay` field to existing struct - Maintains existing input validation (`value >= 5 && value <= 10000`) - Properly guards the `led_cdev->blink_set()` call with null pointer check - No buffer operations or memory allocations that could introduce vulnerabilities 3. **Access control unchanged**: The same sysfs interface and permission model is used - no privilege escalation or unauthorized access issues. 4. **Pattern analysis**: Comparing to the historical similar commits that were assigned CVEs (commits 3 and 5), those fixed actual kernel panics due to use-after-free/invalid pointer dereference. This commit shows no such dangerous patterns. 5. **Functionality improvement**: The changes logically extend existing LED hardware control to support blink interval configuration, which is a reasonable feature addition for PHY LED activity indication. This follows the pattern of "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 2" which were also feature enhancements/fixes that did not warrant CVE assignment.
5674609535baf pstore: Change kmsg_bytes storage size to u32
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: This is a code improvement/refactoring commit that standardizes data types and adds race condition protection, but it doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability. 2. **Type consistency improvement**: The change from `unsigned long` to `u32` standardizes the type usage across the codebase but doesn't introduce security risks. On 64-bit systems, this actually reduces the potential range from unlimited to 4GB, which is more restrictive. 3. **Race condition mitigation**: The addition of `READ_ONCE()` and `WRITE_ONCE()` with a local variable (`remaining`) prevents `kmsg_bytes` from changing during a dump operation. While this fixes a potential race condition, it's not a security vulnerability - it's a stability/consistency improvement. 4. **No memory safety issues**: Unlike the similar commits that were assigned CVEs (which fixed null pointer dereferences from failed memory allocations), this commit doesn't address any memory safety problems. 5. **Administrative interface**: The `kmsg_bytes` parameter is typically set by administrators and controls the amount of kernel log data stored in pstore - changing this value doesn't create attack vectors. The commit improves code quality and prevents potential race conditions, but there's no evidence of an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
be324b790368c igc: Avoid unnecessary link down event in XDP_SETUP_PROG process
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my security assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Reasoning: 1. **Performance Optimization, Not Security Fix**: This commit is a performance optimization to prevent unnecessary link disruption during XDP program installation. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather improving user experience by avoiding PTP sync loss and packet drops. 2. **Risk vs. Impact Assessment**: While my detailed analysis identified potential security implications of bypassing the full close/open sequence, these represent theoretical risks rather than exploitable vulnerabilities: - The timing windows for race conditions are extremely narrow - The missing synchronization operations are low-risk in the XDP context - No demonstrated attack vectors exist 3. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (5 examples) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar driver optimizations and fixes without security implications. 4. **No Security Intent**: The commit message and code changes show clear intent to optimize performance, not address security concerns. There's no mention of security issues, vulnerabilities, or fixes. 5. **Limited Scope**: The changes only affect XDP program installation in the Intel igc driver - a very specific use case that doesn't expose broader system security. 6. **Standard Driver Practice**: The optimization follows standard patterns used elsewhere in the kernel for avoiding unnecessary hardware resets during configuration changes. While the security analysis revealed some potential hardening opportunities, the commit itself doesn't fix a security vulnerability and the risks identified are theoretical concerns that would require specific mitigations but don't warrant CVE assignment.
503d20ed8cf7c iio: adc: ad7944: don't use storagebits for sizing
- [sasha] ## Analysis Based on my detailed examination of the commit, code changes, and kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ### Commit Analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix 2. **Issue being addressed**: The problem is with size calculation for SPI transfers where `storagebits` was incorrectly used instead of `realbits` when SPI offload support is enabled 3. **Context**: This is a preparatory fix for SPI offload functionality being added in the next commit ### Security Impact Assessment: **No Memory Safety Issues:** - The change involves calculating the correct number of bytes for SPI transfers: `BITS_TO_BYTES(storagebits)` → `AD7944_SPI_BYTES(scan_type)` - The new macro `AD7944_SPI_BYTES` uses `realbits` and follows the same logic as the SPI framework (4 bytes for >16-bit, 2 bytes otherwise) - There's no risk of buffer overflow because: - The sample buffer is pre-allocated with proper alignment (`sample __aligned(IIO_DMA_MINALIGN)`) - The chain mode buffer is also properly allocated based on the calculated size - The fix ensures the allocated size matches what the SPI framework expects **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Issues:** - This is purely an IIO (Industrial I/O) ADC driver fix - No changes to access controls, permissions, or privilege handling - The code operates in kernel space with appropriate driver permissions **No Input Validation or Race Condition Issues:** - No changes to input validation logic - No new race conditions introduced - The fix ensures size calculations are consistent with SPI framework expectations ### Comparison with Similar Commits: All the provided similar commits (iio: adc: ti-ads1119, ad9467 DMA fixes, etc.) were correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are correctness fixes, not security vulnerabilities. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a driver correctness fix to ensure proper operation with new SPI offload functionality. ### Conclusion: This is a functional correctness fix to ensure the AD7944 ADC driver works properly with SPI offload support. While incorrect size calculations could theoretically cause issues, this specific case involves driver-internal size calculations for SPI transfers with pre-allocated buffers, not user-controllable input that could lead to exploitable conditions.
848b09d53d923 r8152: add vendor/device ID pair for Dell Alienware AW1022z
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes directly based on the provided diff: The commit adds support for a new USB device ID for the Dell Alienware AW1022z Ethernet controller. Looking at the changes: 1. **drivers/net/usb/r8152.c**: Adds a new USB device entry `{ USB_DEVICE(VENDOR_ID_DELL, 0xb097) }` to the `rtl8152_table` 2. **include/linux/usb/r8152.h**: Defines `VENDOR_ID_DELL` as `0x413c` This is purely adding device ID support for a new hardware variant. The commit: - Does not fix any existing security vulnerability - Does not introduce any new security risks - Simply extends hardware compatibility by adding a new USB vendor/device ID pair - Uses existing, well-tested driver code paths - Follows the same pattern as other similar device ID additions in the driver Comparing to the historical examples provided, this is very similar to: - Similar Commit 2: Adding device ID for Marvell 88E8075 (CVE Status: NO) - Similar Commit 3 & 4: Adding support for more Alienware laptops (CVE Status: NO) - Similar Commit 5: Adding new quirks for various vendors (CVE Status: NO) All of these are simple device support additions that don't involve security fixes. **NO** This commit simply adds a new USB device ID to enable hardware support for the Dell Alienware AW1022z Ethernet controller. It's a straightforward device compatibility addition that doesn't fix any security vulnerability or introduce security-relevant code changes. The modification only extends the driver's device table to recognize a new hardware variant using existing, tested code paths.
5a1ccffd30a08 ip: fib_rules: Fetch net from fib_rule in fib[46]_rule_configure().
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context from the kernel tree, let me provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Code Change Analysis The commit makes a simple change in the `fib4_rule_configure()` and `fib6_rule_configure()` functions: - **Before**: `struct net *net = sock_net(skb->sk);` - **After**: `struct net *net = rule->fr_net;` ## Why This Is NOT a Security Vulnerability 1. **Preparatory Change**: The commit message explicitly states "The following patch will not set skb->sk from VRF path" - this is a preparatory change for VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) improvements, not a security fix. 2. **Same Network Namespace**: Both `sock_net(skb->sk)` and `rule->fr_net` should refer to the same network namespace in normal operation. The `fib_rule` structure's `fr_net` field (net/core/fib_rules.c:35) is set to the correct network namespace when the rule is created. 3. **Part of Cleanup Series**: Looking at the commit series (commits 7b7df666a233, a9ffd24b5528, 8b498773c861, 5a1ccffd30a0), this is part of a larger refactoring to: - Remove redundant netns checks in `rule_exists()` and `rule_find()` - Pass `net` directly instead of extracting from `skb` - Split fib_nl2rule() for better RTNL handling - Prepare for VRF path changes 4. **No Security Impact**: The change doesn't: - Fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - Address privilege escalation or input validation problems - Resolve race conditions or other security-relevant patterns - Mention any security concerns in the commit message 5. **Consistency with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this change is similar in nature - it's a code cleanup/refactoring without security implications, unlike the one marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed a slab-out-of-bounds access. This is a refactoring change to improve code organization and prepare for VRF functionality changes, not a security fix.
2ffb26afa6426 arch/powerpc/perf: Check the instruction type before creating sample with perf_mem_data_src
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of the commit and supporting code, here is my determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: ## Analysis 1. **Root Cause**: The issue stems from uninitialized memory in the `data_src` field of `perf_sample_data`. After commit e16fd7f2cb1a, `perf_sample_data_init()` no longer initializes the `data_src` field to `PERF_MEM_NA`, leaving it with potentially random values when PMU drivers don't properly validate instruction types. 2. **Impact Assessment**: - **Stack buffer overflow**: The commit message describes a stack smashing detection in userspace (`perf mem report`), not kernel space - **Affected scope**: Limited to PowerPC architecture perf subsystem - **Trigger condition**: Requires specific corner cases with invalid instruction types in hardware sampling 3. **Security Implications**: - This is a **userspace crash/corruption** issue, not a kernel security vulnerability - No privilege escalation or unauthorized access is possible - The issue causes the userspace `perf` tool to abort, but doesn't compromise kernel security - Stack smashing occurs in userspace process memory, not kernel memory 4. **Fix Details**: - Validates instruction types before processing samples: `arch/powerpc/perf/core-book3s.c:2310-2314` - Properly initializes `data_src` to zero in `isa207_get_mem_data_src()`: `arch/powerpc/perf/isa207-common.c:330-333` - Drops invalid samples rather than processing them with garbage data 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar to "Similar Commit 1" (NO CVE) - fixes a userspace crash/corruption issue - Similar to "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" (NO CVE) - improves validation/robustness - Unlike "Similar Commit 3" (YES CVE) which prevented kernel stack corruption This is a **robustness fix** that prevents userspace tool crashes due to uninitialized data, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
6aa989ab2bd0d powerpc/pseries/iommu: memory notifier incorrectly adds TCEs for pmemory
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a functional bug, it does not address a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: ## Key Findings: 1. **Functional Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a case where `iommu_mem_notifier()` incorrectly attempts to pre-map TCEs for persistent memory (pmemory) ranges that are beyond the DDW boundaries. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security flaw. 2. **Safe Failure Mode**: When the code incorrectly tries to map pmemory ranges, the hypervisor safely returns `H_PARAMETER` error code, preventing the operation and causing the `daxctl` command to fail. This represents proper bounds checking at the hypervisor level. 3. **No Memory Corruption Risk**: The fix adds boundary checks (`(arg->start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) < ddw_memory_hotplug_max()`) to prevent incorrect TCE operations, but the original code was not causing memory corruption - it was simply failing safely with an error. 4. **No Privilege Escalation**: The issue affects device DMA mapping configuration and does not provide any avenue for privilege escalation or unauthorized memory access. ## Code Analysis: The key changes in `iommu_mem_notifier()` add proper boundary checking: ```c // Before: Always attempted TCE operations if (window->direct) { ret |= tce_setrange_multi_pSeriesLP(...); } // After: Only for valid memory ranges if (window->direct && (arg->start_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) < ddw_memory_hotplug_max()) { ret |= tce_setrange_multi_pSeriesLP(...); } ``` This is a defensive programming improvement that prevents unnecessary hypervisor calls for out-of-range addresses, but the hypervisor was already properly rejecting these invalid requests. ## Comparison with CVE-worthy commits: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" that involved: - Incorrect permission checking bypass in `/dev/mem` access - Memory corruption due to type mismatches and improper address handling This commit only fixes a functional workflow issue without security implications.
67800d296191d net: fec: Refactor MAC reset to function
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, the code changes, and the kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Code refactoring only**: This is a pure code refactoring that consolidates duplicate reset logic from `fec_restart()` and `fec_stop()` into a single `fec_ctrl_reset()` function. The actual reset behavior and logic remain functionally identical. 2. **Bug fix, not vulnerability**: While the commit message mentions fixing bugs (like `fec_stop()` not checking `FEC_QUIRK_NO_HARD_RESET`), these are functional bugs that could affect network interface behavior, not security vulnerabilities. The specific issue mentioned is that "MII/RMII mode is cleared on eg. a PM power-down event" - this would cause network connectivity issues but does not create security exposures. 3. **No security implications**: The changes involve: - Moving identical reset logic into a shared function - Fixing the missing `FEC_QUIRK_NO_HARD_RESET` check in `fec_stop()` - Standardizing the magic constant `1` to `FEC_ECR_RESET` None of these changes affect security boundaries, access controls, or create exploitable conditions. 4. **Pattern consistent with non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, this follows the same pattern as other FEC driver refactoring and bug fixes that were marked as "CVE Status: NO". The commit addresses code quality and functional correctness issues in the network driver but does not fix any security vulnerabilities that would warrant CVE assignment.
286e696770654 wifi: mac80211: Drop cooked monitor support
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. This is a security improvement, not a vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Code Cleanup, Not a Fix**: The commit removes deprecated cooked monitor interface support that has been unused since hostapd migrated away in 2011 (13+ years ago). The code changes show removal of: - `MONITOR_FLAG_COOK_FRAMES` flag handling - `ieee80211_rx_cooked_monitor()` function - `cooked_mntrs` counters and related infrastructure 2. **Attack Surface Reduction**: This change actually **improves security** by eliminating complex legacy code paths that: - Parsed and transformed 802.11 frames in multiple stages - Had potential for buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, and race conditions - Required ongoing maintenance and security testing 3. **No Functionality Lost**: Raw monitor mode provides equivalent or superior capabilities to the removed cooked monitor interfaces. Modern userspace applications use the nl80211 interface as mentioned in the commit message. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits provided, those with "CVE Status: YES" are fixing actual security vulnerabilities (like the flag validation issue in nl80211). This commit is purely removing unused code, not fixing a specific security flaw. 5. **No Security Regression**: The commit doesn't introduce any new attack vectors or remove security protections - it simply eliminates deprecated code that was a potential source of bugs. This is exemplary proactive security maintenance - removing unused legacy code to reduce attack surface without any functional impact.
574faa0e936d1 wifi: mac80211: add HT and VHT basic set verification
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Analysis Summary:** 1. **Nature of the Change**: This commit adds compliance validation for IEEE 802.11 HT and VHT MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) requirements. It implements proper verification that was missing according to the 802.11 standard specification. 2. **Code Behavior**: The new functions `ieee80211_verify_sta_ht_mcs_support()` and `ieee80211_verify_sta_vht_mcs_support()` check if the station supports the basic MCS rates required by the AP. When validation fails, the code gracefully downgrades the connection mode rather than failing completely: - HT failure → fallback to legacy mode - VHT failure → fallback to HT-only mode 3. **Security Impact Assessment**: - **No memory corruption**: The missing validation doesn't lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or similar critical vulnerabilities - **No privilege escalation**: This is a protocol compliance issue, not a security boundary violation - **Limited attack surface**: A malicious AP could potentially exploit this to force connection downgrades, but this represents a quality-of-service issue rather than a security vulnerability - **Graceful handling**: The fix implements graceful fallback behavior rather than fixing a crash or undefined behavior 4. **Standards Compliance**: The commit explicitly references IEEE P802.11REVme/D7.0 standard requirements that were not being enforced. This is primarily a compliance fix rather than a security fix. 5. **Similar Commit Pattern**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), this follows the same pattern of WiFi protocol compliance improvements and workarounds for interoperability issues. This commit improves protocol compliance and robustness against malformed AP configurations, but the missing validation did not create a traditional security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
8c60179b64434 wifi: mac80211: set ieee80211_prep_tx_info::link_id upon Auth Rx
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a feature enhancement/improvement commit, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message clearly states it's setting `ieee80211_prep_tx_info::link_id` upon Auth Rx "for use by the low level driver" and fixing a call-site where link_id was not populated. 2. **Code analysis**: The changes show: - Adding `info.link_id = ifmgd->auth_data->link_id;` in `ieee80211_rx_mgmt_auth()` - Updating documentation to reflect current state - Adding link_id population in `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` - These are straightforward assignments of existing data fields 3. **No security implications**: - The commit doesn't fix any buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, race conditions, or privilege escalation vulnerabilities - It's simply ensuring that link ID information is properly populated for driver callbacks - The link_id field already exists in the auth_data structure and is just being properly assigned 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the similar commits provided as reference were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar feature additions or minor fixes without security implications. 5. **No mention of security concerns**: The commit message makes no reference to security issues, vulnerabilities, or potential exploits being fixed. This appears to be a routine feature enhancement to improve Multi-Link Operation (MLO) support in mac80211, ensuring drivers receive proper link ID information during authentication processes.
f4995cdc4d02d wifi: mac80211: remove misplaced drv_mgd_complete_tx() call
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the related code: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Code cleanup, not security fix**: The commit removes a misplaced `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` call that was erroneously placed in the "associated" branch instead of the "assoc_data" branch. This is purely a correctness fix to clean up duplicated functionality. 2. **No security impact**: The `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` function is a driver notification mechanism used to inform drivers when management frame transmission is complete. Calling it in the wrong place doesn't create a security vulnerability - it just means drivers might get notifications they don't expect or miss notifications they should receive. 3. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO") - it's a protocol correctness fix in the WiFi stack without security implications. 4. **Missing call was already fixed**: The commit message explicitly states that the missing call was already added in a previous commit (c042600c17d8), and this commit is just removing the duplicate/misplaced call. 5. **No exploitation potential**: There's no indication this could lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security vulnerabilities. It's purely about proper driver notification sequencing. The commit fixes a logical error in driver notification placement but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
1798271b3604b wifi: mac80211: don't unconditionally call drv_mgd_complete_tx()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a CVE assessment. Let me analyze what I've found: ### Analysis Summary: 1. **The Bug**: The code was calling `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` unconditionally in the disconnection path, even when the corresponding `drv_mgd_prepare_tx()` was not called. The prepare function is only called when `(tx || frame_buf)` is true, but complete was called regardless. 2. **What These Functions Do**: - `drv_mgd_prepare_tx()` - Sets up session protection in the WiFi driver to ensure reliable transmission of management frames - `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` - Removes session protection after transmission is complete 3. **Driver Implementation**: In iwlwifi (Intel's WiFi driver): - prepare_tx calls `iwl_mvm_protect_assoc()` to set up session protection - complete_tx calls `iwl_mvm_stop_session_protection()` to remove protection 4. **The Security Implication**: Calling complete without prepare could lead to: - Attempting to stop session protection that was never started - Potential driver state corruption - Possible use-after-free or double-free scenarios if session protection objects are improperly managed 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: All 5 similar commits were marked as "CVE Status: NO", but they were different types of issues (API exports, timing fixes, AMSDU disabling, error path fixes, work cancellation). ### Assessment: This appears to be a **logic bug** rather than a direct security vulnerability. While it could potentially cause driver state inconsistencies, the impact is limited because: 1. The prepare/complete functions are primarily for session protection timing, not memory management 2. Modern WiFi drivers likely have safeguards against stopping protection that wasn't started 3. This affects management frame transmission reliability rather than creating exploitable conditions 4. The bug is in a disconnection path, limiting the attack surface The fix ensures proper pairing of prepare/complete calls, which is good defensive programming but doesn't address a clear security vulnerability. **NO** This commit fixes a state management bug where `drv_mgd_complete_tx()` was called without the corresponding `drv_mgd_prepare_tx()` call. While this could cause driver inconsistencies, it's primarily a reliability issue affecting WiFi management frame transmission during disconnection, not a security vulnerability warranting a CVE.
3fca951123b68 wifi: mac80211: always send max agg subframe num in strict mode
- [sasha] Let me look at the commit changes more carefully. The key change is: ```c // Before: if (sta->sta.deflink.eht_cap.has_eht) { buf_size = local->hw.max_tx_aggregation_subframes; // After: if (sta->sta.deflink.eht_cap.has_eht || ieee80211_hw_check(&local->hw, STRICT)) { buf_size = local->hw.max_tx_aggregation_subframes; ``` This change modifies the condition for when to use the maximum aggregation subframes buffer size. Previously, it only used the max buffer size for EHT-capable stations. Now it also uses the max buffer size when the hardware has the STRICT flag set. Analyzing the security implications: 1. **Nature of change**: This is a behavioral change in WiFi aggregation logic, not a fix for a vulnerability 2. **Buffer size handling**: The change affects which buffer size is used for aggregation, but both paths use validated, bounded values 3. **No bounds checking issues**: The code uses `local->hw.max_tx_aggregation_subframes` which is a driver-provided limit 4. **No input validation**: This doesn't fix input validation or prevent malformed packets 5. **Compliance improvement**: The commit message indicates this is about "strict mode" compliance, suggesting it's a feature enhancement for standards compliance Comparing to the similar commits: - All similar commits marked "NO" were feature enhancements, bug fixes for non-security issues, or compliance improvements - None involved security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or access control issues **NO** This commit improves WiFi standards compliance by ensuring the correct aggregation subframe count is used in strict mode, but does not fix a security vulnerability. It's a feature enhancement that changes when maximum buffer sizes are used, similar to the other non-CVE commits in the reference set.
696cca64308dc wifi: iwlwifi: don't warn during reprobe
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a cosmetic issue where spurious warnings are generated during normal device reprobe operations when firmware is in an error state. The change adds a STATUS_FW_ERROR check in `iwl_trans_wait_txq_empty()` to return -EIO early instead of hitting the `WARN_ONCE()` call. While similar commits were marked as CVE-worthy, this specific fix is purely about preventing log pollution during expected error recovery scenarios. The security impact is minimal - it prevents a one-time warning message during reprobe, but there's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or exploitable vulnerability. The commit message explicitly describes this as preventing warnings "during normal operation scenarios" rather than fixing a security flaw. The `WARN_ONCE()` limitation means this could only generate one spurious warning per boot anyway, making any potential DoS impact negligible. This appears to be a robustness improvement rather than a security fix.
21e4d29ac0def wifi: iwlwifi: use correct IMR dump variable
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is a variable name typo in debug data collection code. The function was incorrectly using `&reg_data` instead of `&imr_reg_data` when dumping DRAM_IMR region data. This means: - It was dumping the wrong region's data (the last processed region instead of the IMR region) - This affects debug dump accuracy but doesn't create a security vulnerability 2. **Code context**: Looking at the function `iwl_dump_ini_trigger()`, both `reg_data` and `imr_reg_data` are local stack variables of the same type (`struct iwl_dump_ini_region_data`). The bug simply caused incorrect debug information to be collected. 3. **Impact assessment**: - No memory corruption potential (both variables are same type) - No buffer overflow risk - No privilege escalation potential - No input validation bypass - This is purely a debug data collection error 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also a data validation fix in iwlwifi - Similar Commit 2-4 (YES CVE): These involved memory corruption, resource leaks, or buffer overflows - This commit is more similar to Commit 1 and 5 (NO CVE) - functional fixes without security implications 5. **Security relevance**: This affects diagnostic/debug functionality rather than core security-sensitive operations. The DRAM_IMR region collection is specifically for firmware debug dumps during error conditions. The commit fixes a functional bug in debug data collection but poses no security risk to the system.
58b21309f97b0 mptcp: pm: userspace: flags: clearer msg if no remote addr
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Code Quality Improvement, Not Security Fix**: The commit removes redundant NULL checking code. The `if (attr_rem)` check was removed because the `mptcp_pm_parse_entry()` function already performs this validation through `mptcp_pm_parse_pm_addr_attr()`, which returns `-EINVAL` if the attribute is NULL. 2. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: - The original code had redundant validation - both the calling code and the called function checked for NULL - The behavior remains the same: if `attr_rem` is NULL, the function will return `-EINVAL` - No security boundary was crossed or bypassed 3. **Functionality Unchanged**: The commit message explicitly states this is about providing "clearer msg if no remote addr" - it's improving error message clarity, not fixing a security issue. 4. **Similar Pattern**: This follows the pattern of the provided examples that are marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are code improvements, refactoring, and bug fixes that don't introduce or fix security vulnerabilities. 5. **Error Handling Preserved**: The error handling path (`goto set_flags_err`) remains intact, and proper validation still occurs through `mptcp_pm_parse_entry()`. The commit removes redundant code while maintaining the same security posture and functionality. It's a code cleanup that improves maintainability without any security implications.
0cded0e413468 wifi: ath12k: Update the peer id in PPDU end user stats TLV
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis of the Code Changes The commit adds a single line to update the `peer_id` field in monitoring statistics: ```c ppdu_info->peer_id = u32_get_bits(info[0], HAL_RX_PPDU_END_USER_STATS_INFO0_PEER_ID); ``` ## Security Analysis 1. **Bounded field extraction**: The `HAL_RX_PPDU_END_USER_STATS_INFO0_PEER_ID` uses `GENMASK(13, 0)`, which limits extracted values to 0-16383, preventing out-of-bounds access. 2. **Statistics/monitoring context**: The `hal_rx_mon_ppdu_info` structure is used for monitoring and statistics collection, not for security-critical operations like access control or memory management. 3. **Existing validation mechanisms**: The codebase has proper peer_id validation in security-critical paths (e.g., `dp_rx.c:972` checks `peer->peer_id > DP_MAX_PEER_ID`). 4. **No direct array access**: This peer_id update doesn't involve direct array indexing that could cause memory corruption. ## Comparison with Similar Commits This matches the pattern of similar commits marked "NO": - **Similar Commit 1 & 2**: WiFi driver functionality fixes - **Similar Commit 4 & 5**: Correctness improvements in networking code The only commit marked "YES" (Similar Commit 3) was fixing an actual memory leak, which is a clear security issue. ## Conclusion This commit fixes data accuracy in monitoring/statistics rather than a security vulnerability. The peer_id update improves the correctness of statistical reporting but doesn't address any exploitable security weakness or create new attack vectors. It's a functionality improvement, not a security fix.
dff4f278ee1ef wifi: ath12k: fix the ampdu id fetch in the HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV
- [sasha] Let me analyze the changes more systematically. Based on my analysis of the commit: **Analysis:** 1. **What the commit does:** - Changes how `ampdu_id` is extracted from the `HAL_RX_MPDU_START` TLV - **Before:** `ampdu_id` was incorrectly extracted using `HAL_RX_MPDU_START_INFO1_PEERID` mask from `info[0]` - **After:** `ampdu_id` is correctly extracted using `HAL_RX_MPDU_START_INFO0_PPDU_ID` mask from `info[0]` - Moves `ampdu_id` field from being a global array to per-user statistics - Adds `ampdu_present` boolean field to track AMPDU presence 2. **The bug being fixed:** - The code was incorrectly using the peer ID mask (`GENMASK(29, 16)`) to extract AMPDU ID - It should use the PPDU ID mask (`GENMASK(31, 16)`) instead - This resulted in wrong AMPDU identification and potentially incorrect packet processing 3. **Security implications:** - This is a **data corruption/misidentification bug** in packet processing - The wrong AMPDU ID could lead to: - Incorrect packet aggregation tracking - Wrong radiotap header information being reported to userspace - Potential packet misclassification in monitoring mode - However, this appears to be limited to **monitoring/statistics functionality** - No evidence of privilege escalation, memory corruption, or direct security bypass 4. **Comparison with similar commits:** - All 5 similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" - They were all functional fixes in WiFi driver code without security implications - This commit follows the same pattern - it's a functional correctness fix **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes incorrect AMPDU ID extraction that could lead to wrong packet classification and statistics, it's a functional bug fix in monitoring/statistics code rather than a security vulnerability. The issue affects data accuracy in monitoring mode but doesn't create exploitable security conditions like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or access control bypasses. The change is limited to correcting which bit mask is used to extract packet identifiers, similar to the other non-CVE WiFi driver fixes in the reference set.
00e4dc11695d4 wifi: ath12k: use arvif instead of link_conf in ath12k_mac_set_key()
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a critical security vulnerability in WiFi cryptographic key management. **Security Analysis:** The code changes reveal a serious security flaw in the `ath12k_mac_set_key()` function, which is responsible for installing encryption/decryption keys in WiFi hardware. The key security issues are: 1. **Cryptographic Key Misassignment**: The old code could fail to properly identify the peer address when `link_conf` is unavailable during ML station shutdown, potentially causing keys to be associated with wrong devices or corrupted addresses. 2. **Authentication Bypass Potential**: The error path `"unable to access bss link conf in set key"` indicates that key operations could fail during critical security state transitions, potentially leaving systems in an insecure state or allowing unauthorized access. 3. **Timing-Based Attack Vector**: The ML station shutdown timing window where `link_conf` becomes unavailable creates an exploitable race condition that sophisticated attackers could manipulate to cause key management failures. 4. **Multi-Link Security Context Corruption**: In ML scenarios, wrong peer address resolution could lead to cross-link security breaches where keys intended for one link are misapplied to another. The fix eliminates these vulnerabilities by using the more reliable `arvif->bssid` instead of the potentially unavailable `link_conf`, ensuring consistent and secure peer address resolution in all scenarios. This directly impacts the confidentiality and integrity of wireless communications and could lead to complete wireless security bypass in affected Multi-Link environments, warranting CVE assignment.
5cec2d86c7f42 wifi: ath12k: Enable MLO setup ready and teardown commands for single split-phy device
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this ath12k WiFi driver commit, I can now provide a definitive assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Implementation Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a missing driver initialization step where MLO setup commands weren't being sent to firmware for single split-phy devices. This is an internal implementation oversight, not a vulnerability in input handling or security controls. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While the issue can cause firmware asserts during multi-link associations, this results in WiFi adapter reset/restart rather than system compromise. The impact is limited to network connectivity loss, not system security. 3. **Not Maliciously Exploitable**: The firmware assert occurs during legitimate MLO association attempts, not due to malformed packets or crafted attacks. The code changes show this is about proper driver-firmware communication initialization: - Removes `ag->num_devices == 1` condition check in `ath12k_core_mlo_setup()` - Adds `ath12k_get_num_partner_link()` checks to prevent unnecessary commands when no partner links exist - Ensures MLO setup/ready/teardown commands are sent for all MLO-capable devices 4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The provided similar commits all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve WiFi MLO feature enhancements, protocol improvements, and bug fixes - none were deemed security vulnerabilities. 5. **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Issues**: The changes don't involve access control, memory safety, privilege boundaries, or other typical security-relevant code patterns. This is a reliability/stability fix ensuring proper MLO initialization for single split-phy devices to prevent firmware crashes, not a security vulnerability.
0f65f59e632d9 iio: adc: ad7606: protect register access
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. Let me examine what this commit is doing and compare it to the similar commits provided. **Analysis:** This commit adds `iio_device_claim_direct_mode()` and `iio_device_release_direct_mode()` calls around register write operations (`write_scale` and `write_os`) in the ad7606 ADC driver. **Key observations:** 1. **Race condition protection**: The commit protects register access from concurrent read/write operations by claiming direct mode before register writes 2. **Existing mutex**: The function already has `guard(mutex)(&st->lock)` at line 852, which protects the device state 3. **Direct mode claiming**: The added `iio_device_claim_direct_mode()` calls prevent other operations (like buffered reads) from interfering with register writes 4. **Pattern matching**: This is very similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which both add direct mode claiming during calibration operations - both marked as **CVE Status: NO** **Security implications:** - This is a **race condition fix** that prevents concurrent access to hardware registers - Without this protection, concurrent operations could lead to inconsistent device state or corrupted register values - However, this appears to be a **robustness/correctness fix** rather than a **security vulnerability** - The race condition could cause device malfunction but doesn't appear to have direct security implications like privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption **Comparison to reference commits:** - Similar commits 1 and 3 show nearly identical patterns (adding direct mode claims around hardware operations) and were marked "CVE Status: NO" - Similar commit 2 (marked YES) was about array bounds protection - a different class of vulnerability - This commit follows the same pattern as the non-CVE commits **NO** This commit fixes a race condition in register access but does not address a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment. It's a robustness improvement similar to commits 1 and 3 in the reference examples, which were also marked as non-CVE. The race condition could cause device malfunction but lacks direct security implications like memory corruption or privilege escalation.
e3aa43a50a645 xfrm: prevent high SEQ input in non-ESN mode
- [sasha] Let me analyze this commit without exploring the kernel tree further, based on the information provided and my understanding of XFRM security. **Analysis:** This commit adds input validation to prevent users from setting high sequence numbers (`seq_hi` and `oseq_hi`) when Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) mode is disabled. **Key Changes:** 1. For output SAs in non-ESN mode: Rejects `oseq_hi` != 0 2. For input SAs in non-ESN mode: Rejects `seq_hi` != 0 **Security Assessment:** This is **input validation** that prevents invalid configuration rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. The commit: 1. **Adds proper bounds checking** for sequence number configuration 2. **Prevents inconsistent state** by rejecting 64-bit sequence values in 32-bit mode 3. **Provides clear error messages** to users about invalid configurations However, this appears to be a **hardening/correctness fix** rather than a security vulnerability fix because: - The commit message doesn't mention security implications - It's preventing invalid configurations, not memory corruption or privilege escalation - Similar to the reference commits which were marked "CVE Status: NO" - The fix ensures proper state validation but doesn't indicate prior exploitable conditions **NO** This commit prevents invalid XFRM SA configuration by rejecting high sequence numbers in non-ESN mode (lines 181-186 and 199-204), but represents input validation hardening rather than fixing an exploitable security vulnerability. The changes ensure configuration consistency without indicating prior memory corruption or privilege escalation risks.
4dd40b5f9c3d8 drm/v3d: Add clock handling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if accessing hardware registers without proper clock handling constitutes a security vulnerability. Let me examine what the security implications are: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit adds missing clock handling to the V3D DRM driver but does not fix a security vulnerability that should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a hardware initialization bug where V3D registers (`V3D_MMU_DEBUG_INFO`, `V3D_HUB_IDENT1`, `V3D_HUB_IDENT3`) were being accessed before enabling the necessary clock. This is a correctness/reliability issue, not a security issue. 2. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The register accesses occur during driver initialization in kernel space. There's no evidence that userspace can trigger these reads or that they expose sensitive information to unprivileged contexts. 3. **Impact Analysis**: Without proper clock enabling: - Register reads might return undefined/garbage values - The hardware might not respond correctly - Driver initialization might fail or behave unpredictably - System might hang or crash due to hardware access errors 4. **Comparison to Similar CVE-Assigned Commits**: The reference commits that received CVEs all involved input validation failures where userspace could pass invalid handles that the kernel would then use unsafely. This commit fixes a purely internal kernel driver initialization sequence. 5. **No Privilege Escalation or Information Disclosure**: The fix doesn't address any scenario where an attacker could gain elevated privileges, access unauthorized memory, or extract sensitive information. This is a bug fix that improves system stability and correctness, but the underlying issue does not constitute a security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
e1d68ea58c7e9 net/mlx5e: reduce the max log mpwrq sz for ECPF and reps
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The analysis shows this is a memory optimization change, not a security vulnerability fix. **Key reasons:** 1. **Performance optimization, not security fix**: The commit reduces max MPWRQ size from 256KB (log=18) to 128KB (log=17) for ECPF and representors to optimize memory usage and fix ring size allocation inefficiencies. 2. **No security vulnerability addressed**: The code changes don't fix buffer overflows, memory corruption, access control issues, or any other security-related problems. The commit message explicitly states this is for "saving representor memory" and fixing allocation limitations. 3. **Reduces attack surface**: By decreasing buffer sizes, this change actually reduces memory consumption and potential attack surface rather than fixing an exploitable condition. 4. **Similar pattern in reference commits**: All 5 similar commits provided were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar driver optimizations, memory management improvements, or configuration fixes without security implications. The change in `mlx5e_mpwrq_log_wqe_sz()` to use `MLX5_REP_MPWRQ_MAX_LOG_WQE_SZ` (17) instead of `MLX5_MPWRQ_MAX_LOG_WQE_SZ` (18) for ECPF devices is purely a resource management optimization with no security impact.
b9cc8f9d70086 net/mlx5e: reduce rep rxq depth to 256 for ECPF
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a performance optimization that reduces memory consumption and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit reduces the RX queue depth from 1024 to 256 entries for non-uplink representor network devices on ECPF (Embedded Control and Processing Function) eswitch managers. This is purely a memory optimization change, not a security fix. 2. **Code analysis**: The change adds a single condition `if (!mlx5e_is_uplink_rep(priv) && mlx5_core_is_ecpf(mdev))` that sets `params->log_rq_mtu_frames = MLX5E_REP_PARAMS_DEF_LOG_RQ_SIZE` (0x8, which equals 256 entries) instead of the default 1024 entries. 3. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflow fixes - No access control changes - No memory leak fixes (different from the unrelated memory leak fix in c6cf0b6097bf) - No input validation improvements - No privilege escalation concerns 4. **Commit message context**: The commit explicitly states this is for "memory pressure issues for embedded devices" and describes it as a performance optimization to reduce memory consumption from 2.8GB to a lower amount when scaling to thousands of representors. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are also optimization/refactoring changes without security implications, which aligns with this commit's nature. The change reduces resource allocation as an optimization, not as a fix for any vulnerability or security issue.
a38cc5706fb9f net/mlx5e: set the tx_queue_len for pfifo_fast
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit thoroughly: **Analysis:** 1. **What the commit does:** - Sets the `tx_queue_len` for representor network devices when running on ECPF (Embedded CPU Physical Function) - Changes from default qdisc queue length (1024) to 128 (1 << 7, since MLX5E_REP_PARAMS_DEF_LOG_SQ_SIZE = max(0x7, 0x6) = 7) - Only applies when `mlx5_core_is_ecpf(mdev)` is true 2. **Purpose:** - Memory optimization: reduces memory usage from 393KB to 49KB per representor - Affects the pfifo_fast qdisc memory allocation 3. **Security implications:** - This is a pure memory optimization change - No input validation, access control, or privilege changes - No buffer overflow, race condition, or memory safety issues - Does not affect core security mechanisms - The change is conditional and only affects specific hardware configurations (ECPF) 4. **Code analysis:** - The change is a simple assignment: `netdev->tx_queue_len = 1 << MLX5E_REP_PARAMS_DEF_LOG_SQ_SIZE;` - The constant evaluates to 128, which is a reasonable queue length - The change is guarded by `mlx5_core_is_ecpf(mdev)` condition - No error handling issues or potential security vulnerabilities 5. **Comparison with similar commits:** - All provided similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" - Those were also optimization/configuration changes without security implications - This follows the same pattern - performance/memory optimization without security impact **Conclusion:** **NO** This commit is a straightforward memory optimization that reduces queue length for better memory utilization in ECPF configurations. It does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities. The change is limited in scope, well-controlled with proper conditional checks, and purely addresses performance/memory efficiency without touching any security-sensitive code paths.
95b9606b15bb3 net/mlx5: Extend Ethtool loopback selftest to support non-linear SKB
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze this systematically: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a bug in the MLX5 Ethernet driver's loopback selftest functionality, but it does not address a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Scope of Impact**: The issue is confined to the driver's selftest functionality (`mlx5e_test_loopback_validate`), which is used for diagnostic purposes during ethtool loopback tests, not in normal packet processing paths. 2. **Nature of the Bug**: The code was incorrectly accessing non-linear SKB data without first linearizing it. Before the fix, when `skb_headlen(skb)` was smaller than expected but the total SKB contained enough data in fragments, the function would incorrectly fail the validation check and potentially access invalid memory addresses when casting headers. 3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: This is a diagnostic/testing code path, not a security-critical data processing path. The bug affects test reliability rather than system security. 4. **Memory Access Pattern**: While the bug could theoretically cause out-of-bounds reads when accessing packet headers (`ethh`, `iph`, `udph`, `mlxh`) from non-linear SKBs, this occurs in a controlled test environment with known packet structures, not in processing of arbitrary network traffic. 5. **Comparison with Reference Commits**: All five similar commits provided were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar non-security bug fixes in the same driver (error reporting, configuration validation, protocol handling improvements, etc.). The fix (`skb_linearize(skb)`) ensures that all packet data is in a contiguous memory region before accessing it, which is a correctness fix rather than a security fix. This type of issue is common in network drivers and typically does not warrant CVE assignment unless it affects security-critical paths or can be exploited maliciously.
1a9304859b3a4 net/mlx5: XDP, Enable TX side XDP multi-buffer support
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific code changes in the commit to understand the security implications: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit removes conditional XDP multi-buffer support and makes it always enabled in the mlx5 driver. The changes are: 1. **Removes conditional state tracking**: The `MLX5E_SQ_STATE_XDP_MULTIBUF` state bit and `is_xdp_mb` parameter are removed from en.h:367, params.c:1247, params.h:33, and reporter_tx.c:16. 2. **Simplifies XDP frame transmission**: In xdp.c:612-650, the code removes the conditional `test_bit(MLX5E_SQ_STATE_XDP_MULTIBUF, &sq->state)` check and always uses the multi-buffer path for XDP frame handling. 3. **Removes WQE pre-initialization**: In en_main.c:2023-2060, removes the optimization that pre-initialized Work Queue Entries (WQEs) for non-multi-buffer cases. **Security Assessment:** This is **not a security vulnerability** but rather a code simplification and feature enablement: - **No buffer overflows fixed**: The commit doesn't fix any memory corruption, buffer overflows, or bounds checking issues. - **No memory safety improvements**: The changes don't address memory leaks, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues. - **No access control changes**: No privilege escalation fixes or access control modifications. - **Feature enablement, not security fix**: The commit message clearly states this enables a feature ("ensures that XDP multi-buffer support is always enabled") rather than fixing a vulnerability. **Compared to similar commits:** - Similar Commit 2 & 4 (CVE Status: YES) fixed actual memory corruption issues with buffer allocation mismatches causing crashes and NULL pointer dereferences. - Similar Commits 1, 3, & 5 (CVE Status: NO) were feature enhancements or optimizations without security implications. This commit falls into the latter category - it's a code simplification that removes conditional behavior in favor of always enabling XDP multi-buffer support, which improves packet handling but doesn't fix any security vulnerabilities.
04ad06e41d1c7 scsi: target: spc: Fix loop traversal in spc_rsoc_get_descr()
- [sasha] Now I can analyze the security implications of this commit. ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit fixes a logical control flow issue in the `spc_rsoc_get_descr()` function within the SCSI target subsystem. The key changes are: 1. **Added early returns**: The function now returns `TCM_NO_SENSE` immediately after finding and setting the appropriate opcode descriptor in all three case branches (0x1, 0x2, 0x3). 2. **Loop termination fix**: Previously, the function would continue iterating through the entire `tcm_supported_opcodes` array even after finding the correct descriptor, which is inefficient and could potentially overwrite a valid descriptor if multiple matches existed. 3. **Consistent return value**: Changed the final return from `0` to `TCM_NO_SENSE` for consistency. **Security Assessment:** This is **not a security vulnerability** because: - **No memory safety issues**: The fix doesn't address buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption - **No privilege escalation**: The function deals with SCSI operation code reporting, not access control - **No information disclosure**: The function properly validates input and returns appropriate error codes - **Logic correctness only**: This is purely a control flow optimization that ensures the function stops searching after finding the first matching descriptor The commit is similar to the reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a correctness fix rather than a security fix. The SCSI target subsystem properly validates inputs and the change doesn't introduce or fix any security-relevant conditions. **NO**
33da70bd1e115 drm/amd/display/dm: drop hw_support check in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a comprehensive assessment of this commit: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary 1. **Nature of the Change**: This commit removes a hardware support check (`!ddc_service->ddc_pin->hw_info.hw_supported`) from the i2c transfer function, allowing software i2c to be used when hardware i2c is not supported. 2. **Security Context**: Looking at the commit history, I can see that: - A previous commit (`b71f4ade1b89`) **added** this check specifically to fix a NULL pointer dereference (CVE Status: YES) - The current commit removes only the `hw_supported` part while keeping the `!ddc_service->ddc_pin` NULL check 3. **Safety Validation**: The underlying `dce_i2c_submit_command()` function has proper input validation: - It checks if `ddc` is NULL (returns false if so) - It checks if `cmd` is NULL (returns false if so) - It gracefully falls back from hardware i2c to software i2c when hardware is unavailable 4. **Functional Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to "DC supports SW i2c as well. Drop the check." This is expanding functionality to allow software i2c, not fixing a vulnerability. 5. **No Security Implications**: - The NULL pointer check that prevented the original security issue remains in place - The removed check was only preventing the use of software i2c when hardware i2c wasn't supported - The underlying DC layer properly handles both hardware and software i2c cases 6. **Related Commits**: The surrounding commits in the same timeframe show this is part of a broader effort to add OEM i2c bus support and improve i2c functionality, not security fixes. This is a feature enhancement that safely removes an overly restrictive check while maintaining the necessary safety validations that prevent security issues.
8544374c0f82e drm/amdkfd: Have kfd driver use same PASID values from graphic driver
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it makes significant architectural changes to PASID handling in the KFD driver, it is not fixing a security vulnerability but rather implementing a design change for functionality. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the change**: This is an architectural improvement to support spatial partitioning (CPX mode) where multiple partitions share a physical GPU device. The commit moves from KFD driver managing its own PASID values to using the graphics driver's PASID values that are per-VM. 2. **Not a vulnerability fix**: The commit message and code changes indicate this is a functional enhancement, not a security fix. The motivation is to support multiple spatial partitions correctly, not to address a security issue. 3. **Code changes are systematic**: The changes systematically replace PASID management throughout the codebase: - Removes `process->pasid` and adds `pdd->pasid` - Updates lookup functions to work with the new PASID model - Changes logging to use PID instead of PASID for user visibility - Removes `amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm_set_vm_pasid()` function 4. **Similar commits precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that change logging (Similar Commit 1), optimize performance (Similar Commit 2), or add features (Similar Commit 3, 5) are marked as "NO" for CVE assignment. Only Similar Commit 4, which fixes a null pointer dereference bug, is marked "YES". 5. **No security boundary violation**: While PASID values are security-relevant for process isolation, this commit is changing the source of PASID assignment rather than introducing a vulnerability. The graphics driver was already responsible for VM management, so having it manage PASID values is a logical architectural decision. This is a functional enhancement to support new hardware features (spatial partitioning), not a security vulnerability fix.
667b96134c9e2 drm/amdgpu: enlarge the VBIOS binary size limit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with the similar commits provided: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit simply increases a size limit constant from 3MB to 16MB (`AMD_VBIOS_FILE_MAX_SIZE_B` from `1024*1024*3` to `1024*1024*16`). 2. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to "support the flashing tool" for chips with larger VBIOS files - this is a legitimate functional enhancement, not a security fix. 3. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which added validation checks to prevent buffer overflows), this commit is expanding a limit rather than fixing a missing validation. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - CVE-assigned commits (Similar Commits 1, 2, 4) added **validation checks** to prevent buffer overflows - Non-CVE commits (Similar Commits 3, 5) made functional improvements without security implications - This commit follows the pattern of Similar Commit 3, which also increased a buffer size for legitimate functional reasons 5. **Security implications**: Increasing a size limit alone doesn't introduce or fix a security vulnerability. The underlying validation mechanisms that use this constant would still apply - they just allow larger legitimate VBIOS files. This is a routine functional enhancement to accommodate larger VBIOS files from newer hardware, not a security fix that warrants CVE assignment.
f7a594e40517f drm/amdgpu: Use active umc info from discovery
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide the CVE assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a correctness issue in the AMD GPU driver's UMC (Unified Memory Controller) handling, but it does not appear to be a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** 1. **What the fix does**: The commit changes how UMC instances are iterated by using `umc.active_mask` directly instead of reassigning it as `AID mask`. This prevents accessing harvested (disabled) UMC instances. 2. **Code changes**: - Removes the line `adev->umc.active_mask = adev->aid_mask` in `gmc_v9_0.c:1507` - Adds a new function `amdgpu_umc_loop_all_aid()` that properly uses the active mask to iterate only over active UMC instances - Modifies `amdgpu_umc_loop_channels()` to use this new function when `adev->aid_mask` is set 3. **Security implications**: While accessing harvested/disabled hardware components could theoretically cause system instability, this appears to be: - A hardware abstraction layer correctness fix - Related to proper hardware enumeration, not memory safety - No indication of privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access control bypass - Similar to other hardware configuration fixes in the reference commits (all marked CVE Status: NO) 4. **Impact**: The bug could cause the driver to attempt operations on non-existent UMC instances, leading to potential system instability or incorrect memory error reporting, but not exploitable security vulnerabilities. This is a hardware configuration correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability.
5f0d1ef6f16e1 drm/amd/display: Populate register address for dentist for dcn401
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the comprehensive security assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Primary Issue is Functional**: The commit fixes a missing register address definition (`DENTIST_DISPCLK_CNTL`) in the DCN401 display driver that prevents proper clock frequency reading during boot. This is fundamentally a hardware initialization bug. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While there are minor security implications (potential information disclosure from uninitialized register access), the main consequence is system functionality failure rather than exploitable security vulnerability. 3. **No Attack Vector**: The issue affects kernel-level hardware register access with no direct user input path. An attacker would already need kernel-level privileges to interact with these registers. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this most closely resembles "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 2" (both marked CVE Status: NO) which also deal with register address corrections in AMD display drivers without security implications. 5. **Impact Assessment**: The missing register definition causes incorrect clock frequency readings leading to boot failures and display issues, but doesn't create exploitable security vulnerabilities. The commit adds the missing `SR(DENTIST_DISPCLK_CNTL)` entry to `CLK_REG_LIST_DCN401()` and defines `DCN_BASE__INST0_SEG1`, which are straightforward functional fixes to ensure proper hardware register access for display clock management.
3a7810c212bcf drm/amd/display: Increase block_sequence array size
- [sasha] **YES** This commit fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **Buffer Overflow Fix**: The commit message explicitly states that `hwss_build_fast_sequence` can "generate more than 50 steps" which "overflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps, causing a crash." 2. **Code Evidence**: The function `hwss_build_fast_sequence` in `/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/core/dc_hw_sequencer.c` contains 83+ array accesses to `block_sequence[*num_steps]` with multiple nested loops that can generate many steps, particularly with 6-pipe configurations. 3. **Memory Corruption**: The overflow corrupts adjacent memory (`block_sequence_steps`), which can lead to system crashes and potentially exploitable conditions. 4. **Similar CVE Pattern**: This matches the pattern of Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 which were all assigned CVEs for fixing buffer overruns/overflows in AMD display drivers. 5. **Impact**: Buffer overflows in kernel code can lead to denial of service (crashes) and potentially privilege escalation if exploitable. The fix increases the array size from 50 to 100 elements, which directly addresses the buffer overflow condition that could cause memory corruption and system instability.
3c50bf2196aad drm/amd/display: Reverse the visual confirm recouts
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Fix:** The commit addresses a functional bug in AMD display driver's visual confirmation feature, not a security vulnerability. The issue was that when visual confirmation (a debugging feature) was enabled, cursor disable logic failed for planes covering the bottom of the screen, leading to duplicate cursors and scaling artifacts. **Code Changes Analysis:** 1. **New function `reverse_adjust_recout_for_visual_confirm()`**: This simply reverses previous rectangle adjustments by adding back offsets that were subtracted for visual confirmation display. This is a coordinate calculation fix, not a security boundary issue. 2. **Code consolidation**: The commit consolidates multiple copies of cursor disable logic (`dcn10_can_pipe_disable_cursor`, `dcn401_can_pipe_disable_cursor`, `dc_can_pipe_disable_cursor`) into a single function `resource_can_pipe_disable_cursor`. This is a refactoring improvement that reduces code duplication. 3. **Rectangle bounds checking**: The fix ensures proper rectangle calculations for cursor overlap detection by reversing visual confirmation adjustments before doing comparisons. **Why No CVE:** - This is a **functional bug fix** for a debug feature, not a security vulnerability - The issue affects **visual display artifacts**, not memory safety or access control - No evidence of potential for **privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service** - The fix **improves code quality** by consolidating logic but doesn't address a security flaw - Similar to "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" which were marked CVE Status: NO The commit represents good engineering practice by fixing display logic and reducing code duplication, but lacks the security implications necessary for CVE assignment.
38e8ca3e4b6de amdgpu/soc15: enable asic reset for dGPU in case of suspend abort
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a functional issue, not a security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **Nature of the issue**: The commit addresses suspend abort scenarios where the GPU fails to resume properly, causing ring test failures and device resume errors. This is a reliability/functionality issue, not a security problem. 2. **Code changes**: The fix removes the APU-only restriction in `soc15_need_reset_on_resume()`, allowing both dGPU and APU to be reset when suspend is aborted. The change is from: ```c if (adev->flags & AMD_IS_APU && adev->in_s3 && !pm_resume_via_firmware()) ``` to: ```c if (adev->in_s3 && !pm_resume_via_firmware()) ``` 3. **Security implications**: The commit message and code changes show no indication of security vulnerabilities being fixed. The errors mentioned (ring test failures, device resume failures) are operational issues that affect system stability but do not create security risks like privilege escalation, memory corruption, or unauthorized access. 4. **Similar commit patterns**: Comparing to the provided examples, this resembles the "CVE Status: NO" commits that fix GPU reset and suspend/resume functionality issues without security implications. The commit improves system reliability by ensuring proper GPU reset during suspend abort scenarios but does not address any security vulnerability.
04893397766a2 drm/amdgpu: Skip err_count sysfs creation on VF unsupported RAS blocks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context from the kernel tree, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a user interface improvement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit prevents creation of sysfs files for RAS (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) error count queries on VF (Virtual Function) devices where those specific RAS blocks are not supported. 2. **Previous Behavior**: Before this fix, when VF devices attempted to query error counts for unsupported RAS blocks through sysfs files, the `amdgpu_ras_query_error_status()` function would fail and return `-EINVAL`, causing the sysfs read to return `-EINVAL` to userspace. This was functionally correct but created unnecessary sysfs interfaces. 3. **New Behavior**: The commit adds a check `amdgpu_virt_ras_telemetry_block_en()` during sysfs creation time. If a VF doesn't support a particular RAS block, the sysfs file isn't created at all. This is a cleaner approach that avoids exposing non-functional interfaces. 4. **No Security Impact**: - There's no privilege escalation - No memory corruption - No access control bypass - No information disclosure - The error handling was already in place and functional 5. **Comparison with CVE Examples**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 2 (CVE Status: YES) fixed a NULL pointer dereference which is a clear security issue - This commit is more similar to Similar Commits 1, 3, 4, and 5 (all CVE Status: NO) which are functionality improvements without security implications 6. **Code Changes Analysis**: The changes are purely preventive - instead of creating sysfs files that would fail when accessed, they're simply not created. The underlying VF capability checks (`amdgpu_virt_req_ras_err_count` returning `-EOPNOTSUPP`) remain the same. This is a code quality and user experience improvement rather than a security fix.
cbd97d621ece1 drm/amd/display: Ammend DCPG IP control sequences to align with HW guidance
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ## Analysis 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a hardware control sequence correction that fixes the order of operations for power gating control, not a security vulnerability fix. 2. **What the commit changes**: - Before: The code unconditionally enabled `IP_REQUEST_EN`, performed power gating operations, then unconditionally disabled it - After: The code now checks the original state of `IP_REQUEST_EN` and only toggles it if it was originally off (0) 3. **Technical Impact**: - The fix prevents unnecessary toggling of the `IP_REQUEST_CNTL` register when it's already enabled - This aligns with hardware guidance for proper power management sequences - The change is defensive programming to avoid potential hardware state corruption 4. **Security Assessment**: - No memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No privilege escalation vectors - No access control bypasses - No input validation vulnerabilities - No race conditions that could be exploited 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: - This closely resembles commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" in the reference examples - Similar to other AMD display driver hardware sequencing fixes that are functional improvements rather than security fixes 6. **Risk Assessment**: - The bug could potentially cause display hardware malfunction or improper power management - However, this represents a reliability/stability issue rather than a security vulnerability - No evidence of exploitability for malicious purposes This is a standard hardware driver fix to ensure proper control sequences according to hardware specifications, not a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
6a7fde433231c drm/amd/display: Update CR AUX RD interval interpretation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with the provided similar commits, I can now make a determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit updates the interpretation of DisplayPort (DP) auxiliary channel read intervals according to a spec update. It modifies timing values for link training, specifically setting `wait_in_micro_secs = 400` when `lttpr_mode != LTTPR_MODE_NON_TRANSPARENT`. 2. **Spec Compliance Fix**: The commit message clearly states this is about updating the driver to match a DisplayPort specification update - "DP spec updated to have the CR AUX RD interval match the EQ AUX RD interval interpretation." 3. **No Security-Relevant Patterns**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fixed buffer overruns, integer overflows, and array bounds checking, this commit only adjusts timing parameters and function signatures. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar commits 1 & 2 (CVE: YES) fixed actual security issues like buffer overruns and integer overflows - Similar commits 3 & 4 (CVE: NO) were configuration/timing changes, similar to this commit - This commit follows the pattern of the non-CVE commits 5. **Code Changes Analysis**: The changes are: - Adding an `lttpr_mode` parameter to `get_cr_training_aux_rd_interval()` - Setting a 400-microsecond wait time for non-transparent LTTPR modes - Reordering function calls to pass the correct parameters These changes are purely functional improvements for DisplayPort link training timing compliance, not security fixes.
1fb85819d6296 drm/amd/pm: Skip P2S load for SMU v13.0.12
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit simply adds a version-specific condition to skip P2S (Power Performance State) table loading for SMU v13.0.12. The change is similar to the existing condition that already skipped P2S table loading in IOV (Input/Output Virtualization) mode. Key observations: 1. **Non-security nature**: The change is a straightforward optimization/compatibility fix that skips loading P2S tables for a specific SMU version (13.0.12), similar to how it already skips for IOV mode. 2. **Pattern consistency**: All the similar commits provided have "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar power management optimizations, version-specific fixes, or feature toggles without security implications. 3. **Controlled behavior**: The code shows that SMU v13.0.12 has its own separate code paths (e.g., `smu_v13_0_12_setup_driver_pptable`, `smu_v13_0_12_get_gpu_metrics`) indicating this is a planned architectural difference, not a security fix. 4. **Early return with no side effects**: The change simply returns 0 early in the initialization function, which is a clean way to skip unnecessary initialization steps for hardware that doesn't need them. 5. **Hardware-specific optimization**: This appears to be a hardware-specific optimization where SMU v13.0.12 doesn't require P2S table loading, similar to how IOV mode doesn't need it. The commit shows no indicators of fixing vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, or other security-relevant patterns.
be704e5ef4bd6 Revert "drm/amd/display: Exit idle optimizations before attempt to access PHY"
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Analysis shows: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a revert of a previous fix that was causing visual display issues (screen flashes/gray screen) after resume from S4/S5 power states. 2. **Code changes**: The revert removes clock manager power optimization calls (`clk_mgr_exit_optimized_pwr_state` and `clk_mgr_optimize_pwr_state`) that were added to prevent DMUB hangs when accessing PHY hardware. 3. **Security implications**: This is a display hardware sequencing issue, not a security vulnerability. The original problem (DMUB hang) and the new problem (screen corruption) are both functional issues related to power management timing, not security-relevant bugs like memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypasses. 4. **Similar commit patterns**: Looking at the historical examples, reverts that fix functional display issues (like the PSR1 revert examples) are marked as "CVE Status: NO" when they don't introduce security vulnerabilities. 5. **Impact assessment**: While the revert potentially reintroduces the DMUB hang issue, this is a hardware lockup/reliability problem rather than a security issue that could be exploited. The commit addresses a regression in display functionality without introducing security vulnerabilities.
36681f15bb12b drm/amd/display: Account For OTO Prefetch Bandwidth When Calculating Urgent Bandwidth
- [sasha] NO This commit fixes bandwidth calculation issues in AMD display drivers but does not warrant CVE assignment. While it addresses important correctness problems (OTO prefetch bandwidth not accounting for multiple DPP pipes and potential mode programming mismatches), these are engineering correctness fixes rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities. The code changes add proper accounting for `PrefetchBandwidthOto` in urgent bandwidth calculations (via `math_max5` instead of `math_max4`) and include defensive assertions to prevent bandwidth overflow. The commit message clearly describes this as fixing calculation inconsistencies that could cause bandwidth requirements to exceed availability, leading to hardware programming mismatches. Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar Commits 1-4 were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with comparable display subsystem correctness issues - Similar Commit 5 was marked "CVE Status: YES" but involved policy mismatches that could cause "system hang" - a more severe impact than bandwidth calculation errors This commit addresses hardware constraint violations and programming inconsistencies but lacks the direct security impact or exploitability typically required for CVE assignment. It's a defensive programming improvement ensuring bandwidth calculations respect physical hardware limitations.
c909a49128a31 drm/amd/display: Fixes for mcache programming in DML21
- [sasha] **NO** While this commit fixes important bugs in mcache programming that could lead to memory corruption, resource conflicts, and system instability, it does not warrant a CVE assignment based on the following analysis: 1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The vulnerabilities are contained within the AMD display driver's mcache programming logic, which requires privileged access to GPU resources. This limits the attack surface to applications that already have graphics subsystem access. 2. **Hardware-Specific Issues**: The fixes address hardware resource management problems (mcache allocation and indexing) rather than traditional memory safety vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. 3. **No Direct Memory Corruption**: While the indexing bugs could cause memory corruption, they appear to be contained within the driver's internal data structures rather than affecting user-controllable memory regions. 4. **Consistent with Historical Patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, commits that fix indexing issues, bounds checking, and resource allocation problems in the AMD display driver typically do not receive CVE assignments unless they demonstrate clear exploitability. The commit fixes legitimate bugs that improve system stability and prevent potential crashes, but the security impact appears insufficient to meet the CVE threshold. The fixes are more aligned with reliability and correctness improvements rather than addressing exploitable security vulnerabilities.
e8bffa52e0253 drm/amd/display: Don't try AUX transactions on disconnected link
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the commit. Let me analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** This commit addresses a functional issue where AUX (Auxiliary) transactions are being attempted on DisplayPort links that are already disconnected. Looking at the code changes: 1. **In `dp_disable_link_phy`**: Added check `&& link->type != dc_connection_none` before calling `dpcd_write_rx_power_ctrl(link, false)` 2. **In `dp_set_fec_ready`**: Added check `if (link->type != dc_connection_none)` before calling `core_link_write_dpcd(link, DP_FEC_CONFIGURATION, ...)` The changes prevent AUX transactions (DPCD writes) when `link->type == dc_connection_none`, meaning the display link is disconnected. **Security Assessment:** This is **NOT** a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **No memory safety issues**: The code doesn't fix buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or memory corruption 2. **No access control violations**: This doesn't involve privilege escalation or unauthorized access 3. **No input validation**: Not related to malformed input handling 4. **Functional robustness only**: This prevents unnecessary hardware transactions on disconnected links, which could cause timing issues or hardware state problems, but doesn't create security vulnerabilities The commit message clearly states this is to avoid "issues in some cases when the sink re-asserts HPD" - this is about proper hardware state management and DisplayPort protocol compliance, not security. Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar commits 1, 2, 4, 5 were marked CVE=YES because they fix **null pointer dereferences** - Similar commit 3 was marked CVE=NO because it was a follow-up fix, not the original vulnerability - This commit doesn't fix null pointer issues or memory safety problems **NO** This commit prevents unnecessary AUX transactions on disconnected DisplayPort links, which is a functional robustness improvement but not a security vulnerability. It doesn't fix memory safety issues, access control problems, or any other security-relevant code patterns.
2a4519c4e9b2e drm/amd/display: remove TF check for LLS policy
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel codebase, I can now provide an assessment: **CVE Status: NO** This commit represents a code simplification/refactoring change rather than a security fix. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit removes transfer function (TF) checks from the Linear Light Scaling (LLS) policy decision logic. The function `spl_choose_lls_policy` was simplified from a complex conditional that considered both pixel format and transfer function type to a simpler logic that only considers pixel format. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - **Before**: The function returned a boolean and had complex conditional logic checking transfer function types (`SPL_TF_TYPE_PREDEFINED`, `SPL_TF_TYPE_DISTRIBUTED_POINTS`, `SPL_TF_TYPE_BYPASS`) - **After**: The function now only sets LLS preference based on pixel format: `LLS_PREF_NO` for subsampled formats, `LLS_PREF_YES` for RGB/YUV444 formats - The `lls_enable_easf` variable and its associated logic were removed from `enable_easf()` 3. **Security Implications**: This appears to be a graphics/display subsystem optimization/simplification. The changes: - Do not affect memory management, access control, or input validation - Do not introduce potential buffer overflows, race conditions, or privilege escalation issues - Are related to display scaling algorithms and rendering policies - Follow the pattern of display driver optimizations seen in the similar commits 4. **Context**: The commit message states "LLS policy not affected by TF" - indicating this removes unnecessary complexity where transfer function checks were not actually needed for the Linear Light Scaling policy decision. 5. **Similar Patterns**: The provided reference commits are all display driver changes that were marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the same pattern of being a display subsystem refinement rather than a security fix. This is a graphics driver optimization that simplifies decision logic for display scaling, not a security vulnerability fix.
5ffd56822a715 drm/amdkfd: fix missing L2 cache info in topology
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it to the similar commits provided, I can make an assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a correctness/completeness fix for cache topology information reporting, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes missing L2 cache information in the topology by properly finding the first active compute unit (CU) instead of assuming the first CU is active. 2. **Code change analysis**: The fix adds a loop to search for the first active CU bitmap rather than blindly using `cu_info->bitmap[start][0][0]`. This prevents using uninitialized or zero data when the first CU is inactive, but doesn't address any security-sensitive operations. 3. **Impact assessment**: Missing cache topology information affects performance optimization and resource allocation but does not create security vulnerabilities. User-space applications might receive incomplete topology data, but this doesn't lead to: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Access control bypasses 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: This is similar to the "NO CVE" commits in the reference set - it's a hardware information reporting fix like the cache line size hard-coding commits, not a security fix like the list validation commit that got a CVE. The fix ensures accurate hardware topology reporting to user-space but has no security implications.
0ea163a18b17f scsi: usb: Rename the RESERVE and RELEASE constants
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Pure refactoring with no functional changes**: The commit only renames `RESERVE` to `RESERVE_6` and `RELEASE` to `RELEASE_6`. The underlying opcodes remain exactly the same (0x16 and 0x17 respectively). 2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is to resolve naming conflicts with other kernel constants and improve naming consistency (adding the command length suffix like `RESERVE_10` already had). There is no mention of fixing any security issue. 3. **Identical to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the provided reference commits which were all marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are all renaming/refactoring commits that don't fix security vulnerabilities. 4. **No change in behavior**: All the case statements, function logic, and SCSI command handling remain functionally identical. The only change is the symbolic constant names used in the source code. 5. **No impact on security mechanisms**: SCSI RESERVE/RELEASE commands are used for device reservation mechanisms, and this rename doesn't alter how these security-relevant operations work. This is a maintenance commit to improve code clarity and avoid naming conflicts, not a security fix.
b40d022ec06ad drm/amd/display: pass calculated dram_speed_mts to dml2
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and kernel source code: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes a calculation error where a hardcoded value (16) was used instead of the proper hardware-derived `wck_ratio` for converting memory clock to DRAM speed. This is primarily a correctness/performance fix, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Limited security impact**: While incorrect bandwidth calculations could theoretically lead to memory underruns or resource exhaustion, this affects the display subsystem's resource allocation rather than creating direct security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or privilege escalation. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved issues like kernel panics due to missing FPU protection and system hangs due to bandwidth validation failures. This commit is more similar to the "CVE Status: NO" commits that fix correctness issues without direct security implications. 4. **Attack surface**: The vulnerability would require local access to trigger display configuration changes on specific AMD hardware, making it a very limited attack vector. 5. **Code changes show**: The fix simply passes an already-calculated value (`clock_limits[i].dram_speed_mts`) instead of using hardcoded math, improving accuracy but not fixing a memory safety or access control issue. This is an important stability fix that prevents potential display-related system issues, but it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it's not a direct security vulnerability.
8dbf0c7556454 net: stmmac: dwmac-loongson: Set correct {tx,rx}_fifo_size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a **functional limitation fix**, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses a configuration issue where `{tx,rx}_fifo_size` were uninitialized (zero) in the dwmac-loongson driver, which prevented MTU changes from working properly. 2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Looking at the `stmmac_change_mtu()` function at line 5942 in `/home/sasha/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c`, the code contains this check: ```c if ((txfifosz < new_mtu) || (new_mtu > BUF_SIZE_16KiB)) return -EINVAL; ``` With `tx_fifo_size` being 0, any MTU change would fail because `0 < new_mtu` would always be true. 3. **Impact Assessment**: This is a **availability/functionality issue** rather than a security issue. It prevents legitimate MTU configuration changes but does not: - Allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation - Cause buffer overflows or memory corruption - Enable information disclosure - Create denial-of-service vulnerabilities - Bypass security controls 4. **Code Changes**: The fix simply sets proper FIFO size values: ```c + plat->tx_fifo_size = SZ_16K amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md plat->tx_queues_to_use; + plat->rx_fifo_size = SZ_16K amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md plat->rx_queues_to_use; ``` This enables the MTU change functionality to work as intended, but doesn't address any security-sensitive code paths. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" were also functional/configuration fixes rather than security issues, which aligns with this assessment. The commit fixes a legitimate driver functionality issue but has no security implications, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
a399af4e3b1ab jbd2: Avoid long replay times due to high number or revoke blocks
- [sasha] ## Analysis **NO** This commit does **not** warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: ### Nature of the Problem The commit addresses a **performance issue**, not a security vulnerability. The problem is that during journal replay with an excessive number of revoke blocks (1M+ records), the default hash table size of 256 entries leads to extremely long hash chains, causing replay times of 95-580 seconds. ### Code Changes Analysis 1. **Hash table sizing optimization**: The code now pre-calculates the number of revoke records during the PASS_SCAN phase and dynamically allocates a larger hash table if needed 2. **DoS mitigation limit**: The code includes a safety limit of 1M entries (`1U << 20`) to prevent problems with "malicious filesystems" 3. **Graceful degradation**: If allocation fails, it falls back to the default table with just a warning ### Security Considerations While the commit mentions "malicious filesystems" in the code comments, this is a **defensive programming practice** rather than fixing an actual security vulnerability: - The performance degradation affects legitimate recovery operations, not system security - The 1M entry limit prevents excessive memory allocation but this is capacity management, not vulnerability mitigation - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure is involved - The issue only affects journal replay performance, not filesystem integrity or security ### Comparison with Similar Commits Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they involve performance optimizations, code reorganization, and operational improvements - similar to this commit. This is a **performance optimization with defensive limits** rather than a security fix, and therefore does not qualify for CVE assignment.
e738d77f78b3a soundwire: cadence_master: set frame shape and divider based on actual clk freq
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. While it adds important input validation and fixes potential division by zero issues, this appears to be a defensive programming improvement rather than a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Input Validation Added**: The commit adds validation for `default_frame_rate` and `default_row` to prevent division by zero, but these values typically come from device tree/ACPI configuration during system initialization, not from untrusted user input. 2. **Mathematical Corrections**: The changes to divider and frame shape calculations are primarily correctness fixes to use actual bus frequency (`curr_dr_freq`) instead of maximum frequency (`max_clk_freq`), improving accuracy rather than fixing a security flaw. 3. **Error Handling**: Converting `cdns_init_clock_ctrl()` to return errors improves robustness but doesn't indicate this was fixing a security vulnerability. 4. **Context Comparison**: Looking at the similar commits provided, the ones marked "CVE Status: YES" (commits 3 and 5) fixed clear out-of-bounds memory access issues. This commit addresses configuration validation and mathematical correctness, which is different in nature. 5. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commits that fixed buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access, this commit doesn't address memory corruption or privilege escalation vulnerabilities. This is a quality improvement that prevents potential system instability from malformed configurations, but doesn't rise to the level of a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
21860f340ba76 phy: exynos5-usbdrd: fix EDS distribution tuning (gs101)
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a typo in register addresses for PHY tuning parameters but does not address a security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit corrects register addresses in `gs101_tunes_pipe3_preinit[]` where lane2 tuning was incorrectly writing to addresses `0x1e90` and `0x1e94` instead of the intended `0x19e0` and `0x19e4`. 2. **Impact assessment**: This is a hardware configuration issue affecting USB PHY tuning parameters for "EDS distribution" (likely related to signal integrity), not a security-relevant bug. The typo resulted in incorrect lane2 configuration but would not create security vulnerabilities. 3. **Code pattern**: The change follows a clear pattern where lane0 uses `0x09e0/0x09e4` and lane2 should use `0x19e0/0x19e4`, maintaining the offset relationship. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") involved similar PHY register configuration fixes, parameter name corrections, and hardware tuning adjustments - none were security-related. 5. **Additional context**: The commit adds "bootloader bug fix" entries to restore original values in the incorrectly-used registers, showing this is purely a hardware configuration correctness issue. This is a straightforward hardware configuration bug fix with no security implications, similar to the other non-CVE commits provided as references.
dcc48a73eae7f soundwire: amd: change the soundwire wake enable/disable sequence
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The analysis shows: 1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit adds two lines calling `amd_sdw_wake_enable(amd_manager, false)` for system suspend and `amd_sdw_wake_enable(amd_manager, true)` for runtime suspend in the `AMD_SDW_POWER_OFF_MODE` path. 2. **Power Management Enhancement**: This is a functional improvement to ensure proper wake interrupt handling during different suspend modes, specifically for the power-off mode path that was previously missing these calls. 3. **No Security Implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - No privilege escalation or input validation concerns - No race conditions or security-sensitive component modifications - This is pure power management functionality 4. **Reference Patterns**: Comparing to the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this commit follows the same pattern of power management improvements without security implications. Similar Commit 1 shows the original wake interrupt handling fix, and this commit extends that work to the power-off mode. 5. **Commit Message Context**: The commit message clearly describes this as an implementation of design flow requirements, not a security fix. The changes are purely functional improvements to power management sequencing with no security vulnerability being addressed.
d58c04e305afb phy: core: don't require set_mode() callback for phy_get_mode() to work
- [sasha] NO This commit fixes a relatively minor API usability issue in the PHY core framework. The changes make the .set_mode() callback truly optional by: 1. Removing the requirement to check `phy->ops->set_mode` before calling the function 2. Adding a null check `if (phy->ops->set_mode)` before calling the callback 3. Still updating `phy->attrs.mode` even when no callback exists This is purely an improvement to the API design that allows `phy_get_mode()` to work without requiring PHY drivers to implement empty stub functions for `.set_mode()`. The code changes show no security implications - there are no buffer overflows, memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security vulnerabilities being addressed. The similar commits in the reference examples are all marked "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar driver framework improvements, error handling fixes, and API usability enhancements that don't introduce or fix security vulnerabilities.
1350dd3691b5f drm/amdgpu/mes11: fix set_hw_resources_1 calculation
- [sasha] **NO** While this commit fixes an important bug in GPU memory allocation calculations, it does not meet the threshold for CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No Direct Security Boundary Violation**: The change from `PAGE_SIZE` to `AMDGPU_GPU_PAGE_SIZE` fixes overallocation on systems with large CPU pages (16KB, 64KB, etc.), but this results in allocating *more* memory than needed, not less. Overallocation doesn't create buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities. 2. **Resource Management Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states this "can lead to overallocation" - meaning wasted memory resources rather than memory corruption or unauthorized access. The GPU gets a larger buffer than expected, which is inefficient but not inherently dangerous. 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: Even on affected architectures (PowerPC, SPARC with large pages), this creates resource inefficiency rather than exploitable security conditions. The GPU hardware and driver still operate within allocated bounds. 4. **Comparison with CVE-worthy Examples**: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which involved buffer overflows (`amdgpu_debugfs_gprwave_read` size check), array bound violations (incorrect loop size calculations), or integer overflows in security-critical calculations, this commit addresses resource allocation efficiency. The fix prevents memory waste and ensures correct resource sizing, but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or memory corruption.
22a6984c5b5df serial: sh-sci: Update the suspend/resume support
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the code changes. Looking at the differences in the commit: 1. **Added suspend/resume register state management**: The commit adds `struct sci_suspend_regs` to save/restore SCIF registers during suspend/resume cycles. 2. **Added reset control support**: The commit adds `struct reset_control *rstc` to manage reset signals during suspend/resume. 3. **Enhanced suspend/resume functions**: The suspend and resume functions now handle both console preservation (when `no_console_suspend` is specified) and reset control. This commit is implementing **power management functionality** for the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC's SCIF (Serial Communication Interface with FIFO). Let me analyze the security implications: **Security Analysis:** 1. **No memory safety issues**: The changes don't introduce buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption vulnerabilities. 2. **No privilege escalation**: The changes don't modify access controls or privilege checks. 3. **No input validation issues**: The code doesn't process untrusted user input in a dangerous way. 4. **No race conditions**: The suspend/resume operations are properly serialized through the device PM framework. 5. **Functionality enhancement, not vulnerability fix**: This commit is adding new suspend/resume functionality to support power saving modes, not fixing an existing security vulnerability. 6. **Register state preservation**: The console save/restore functionality ensures proper state management during suspend/resume, which is a reliability feature, not a security fix. Comparing to the historical examples: - Similar commits 1-5 all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve power management, suspend/resume, or device tree configuration changes - This commit follows the same pattern - it's a feature enhancement for power management **NO** This commit adds suspend/resume support for power management on Renesas RZ/G3S SoCs. It introduces register state preservation and reset control functionality but does not fix any security vulnerability. The changes are related to power management functionality enhancement, not security issue remediation. The code follows proper kernel patterns for device suspend/resume and doesn't introduce memory safety issues, privilege escalation vectors, or other security-relevant problems.
2ae891b826958 sched: Reduce the default slice to avoid tasks getting an extra tick
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The analysis shows: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit only changes a scheduler tuning parameter (`sysctl_sched_base_slice`) from 750000 to 700000 nanoseconds (0.75ms to 0.70ms). This is a minor performance optimization, not a security fix. 2. **No Security-Related Code Changes**: The modifications are purely numerical constants that affect scheduling timing precision. There are no changes to: - Memory management or access control - Input validation - Race condition handling - Buffer bounds checking - Privilege escalation mechanisms 3. **Performance Optimization Only**: The commit message clearly states this is to "avoid tasks getting an extra tick" and improve scheduling precision. The goal is to prevent tasks from running slightly longer than intended due to tick timing inaccuracies. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (Similar Commits 1-3) involve similar scheduler improvements and precision fixes that don't address security vulnerabilities, while those marked "CVE Status: YES" (Similar Commits 4-5) fix actual input validation issues that could be exploited. The change from 750000 to 700000 nanoseconds is a minor scheduler tuning adjustment with no security implications.
93f16a1ab78ca x86/boot: Mark start_secondary() with __noendbr
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **This is a robustness fix, not a security fix**: The commit prevents a triple fault during secondary CPU boot when IBT (Indirect Branch Tracking) is enabled and ENDBR poisoning becomes fatal (converts ENDBR to `ud1` instead of `nop`). 2. **The issue occurs during early boot, not during normal operation**: The problem happens during the handoff from boot stubs to `start_secondary()` before IBT is enabled and before the IDT is set up to handle `#UD` exceptions. This is a very specific boot-time scenario. 3. **The fix is preventative, not reactive**: The `__noendbr` annotation tells the compiler/toolchain that this function doesn't need ENDBR (End Branch) instructions, preventing the generation of code that would cause the triple fault. 4. **No exploitable condition**: A triple fault during CPU boot is a system crash/denial of service, but it's not exploitable for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security compromises. The system simply fails to boot properly. 5. **Similar to other maintenance commits**: This is similar to the "x86/bugs: Do not use UNTRAIN_RET with IBPB on entry" commit (Similar Commit 1) which was marked as NO for CVE - it's a mitigation optimization rather than a security vulnerability fix. The commit message explicitly states this is about preventing boot failures when ENDBR poisoning becomes fatal, not about fixing an exploitable security issue. The change is a single line annotation to suppress IBT/CFI checking for a function that legitimately doesn't need it during the boot process.
2947c8065e9ef phy: phy-rockchip-samsung-hdptx: Swap the definitions of LCPLL_REF and ROPLL_REF
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a hardware register bit definition error but does not represent a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment. **Analysis:** The commit swaps two #define constants (`LCPLL_REF` and `ROPLL_REF`) to match the actual hardware datasheet specifications. The change is purely corrective: - **Before:** `ROPLL_REF` was incorrectly defined as `BIT(1)` and `LCPLL_REF` as `0` - **After:** `LCPLL_REF` is correctly defined as `BIT(1)` and `ROPLL_REF` as `0` This is a hardware configuration correctness fix, not a security vulnerability because: 1. **No security boundary crossed** - This affects internal PLL clock selection in a display PHY driver 2. **Limited attack surface** - Display clock configuration errors don't provide meaningful attack vectors 3. **Similar pattern to reference commits** - All provided reference commits with "NO" CVE status involve similar hardware configuration fixes 4. **Functional correctness issue** - The bug would cause display timing issues or failures, not security vulnerabilities The fix ensures the driver uses the correct PLL reference according to hardware specifications, similar to the other hardware configuration corrections in the reference commits.
b2bd65fbb6173 pinctrl: renesas: rzg2l: Add suspend/resume support for pull up/down
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. The analysis shows this is a functional enhancement that adds missing suspend/resume support for pull-up/pull-down (PUPD) registers, not a security fix. **Key reasons:** 1. **Functional completion, not vulnerability fix**: The commit completes previously incomplete suspend/resume functionality by adding PUPD register preservation. The original implementation simply omitted this hardware state, which is a functional gap rather than an exploitable security flaw. 2. **No security attack surface**: Pull-up/pull-down resistor configurations affect electrical signal characteristics and power consumption but do not create exploitable security conditions, privilege escalation paths, or information disclosure vulnerabilities. 3. **Hardware-level impact only**: The missing PUPD register preservation could cause signal integrity issues, increased power consumption, or hardware malfunction after suspend/resume cycles, but these are reliability/functionality problems, not security vulnerabilities. 4. **Consistent with similar commits**: The provided examples show similar pinctrl commits (register validation, power management, configuration fixes) that were correctly classified as non-security issues. The code changes are straightforward register caching additions (`u32 *pupd[2]` cache arrays, memory allocation, and save/restore logic) that preserve hardware state across power transitions - a standard power management enhancement with no security implications.
b31e668d3111b drm/xe/debugfs: Add missing xe_pm_runtime_put in wedge_mode_set
- [sasha] Now let me look at similar commits in the historical examples to understand the pattern. Looking at the commit that was marked as CVE Status: YES: **NO** This commit fixes a resource management bug (missing xe_pm_runtime_put in error path) but is not a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Resource Management, Not Security**: The fix adds a missing `xe_pm_runtime_put(xe)` call in the failure path of `wedged_mode_set`. This is a power management reference counting issue, not a security flaw. 2. **Debugfs Context**: This affects a debugfs interface (`wedged_mode_set`) which is typically only accessible to root/privileged users and is meant for debugging purposes. 3. **Limited Impact**: The missing runtime PM put would cause: - Reference count imbalance in power management - Potential power management issues (device staying awake longer than needed) - Resource leak, but not exploitable for privilege escalation or system compromise 4. **Comparison with CVE-marked commit**: The similar commit marked "CVE Status: YES" (`drm/xe/oa: Fix "Missing outer runtime PM protection" warning`) was fixing a different type of runtime PM issue that could potentially cause more serious system stability problems. 5. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: This doesn't involve: - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Access control bypass - Information disclosure - System crash/DoS potential This is a standard resource management bug fix that improves system reliability but doesn't constitute a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
882b86fd4e0d4 x86/ibt: Handle FineIBT in handle_cfi_failure()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the available context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does **not** warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fix**: The commit doesn't fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it fixes a functional issue where the CFI_PERMISSIVE option wasn't working correctly with FineIBT. 2. **Enhancement, Not Bug Fix**: The commit message explicitly states it's addressing the fact that "FineIBT failure does not hook into the regular CFI failure case, and as such CFI_PERMISSIVE does not work." This is implementing missing functionality rather than fixing a security flaw. 3. **CFI is a Security Hardening Feature**: Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is a mitigation technique designed to prevent control-flow hijacking attacks. The commit improves the robustness of this security feature by ensuring that the permissive mode works consistently across both kCFI and FineIBT implementations. 4. **Code Analysis**: The changes add: - A new `decode_fineibt_insn()` function to properly decode FineIBT instructions in `arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c:1413-1440` - Modification to `handle_cfi_failure()` in `arch/x86/kernel/cfi.c:73-91` to support both CFI modes 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is similar to the reference commits marked as "NO" that deal with CFI configuration and compatibility issues (commits 1, 2, and 3), rather than the security vulnerability fix marked as "YES" (commit 4). The commit enhances the reliability and consistency of an existing security feature but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers.
7a243e1b814a0 clk: qcom: clk-alpha-pll: Do not use random stack value for recalc rate
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, the code changes, and the kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No actual vulnerability**: The commit fixes a code quality issue where uninitialized stack variables could be used in calculations if `regmap_read()` fails, but this represents a robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability. 2. **MMIO context**: As the commit message explicitly states, "Such failure is really not expected as these are all MMIO reads" - these are memory-mapped I/O operations to hardware registers that are highly unlikely to fail in normal operation. 3. **Limited impact**: Even if regmap_read() were to fail and random stack values were used, the `alpha_pll_calc_rate()` function performs basic arithmetic: `(prate amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md l) + ((prate amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md a) >> ALPHA_SHIFT(alpha_width))`. Using random values would result in incorrect frequency calculations but would not lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked with "CVE Status: YES" involved array underflow vulnerabilities that could lead to memory access violations. This commit only addresses uninitialized variable usage in arithmetic calculations. 5. **Return value handling**: The fix simply returns 0 on read failure, which is a safe fallback that would cause the clock frequency calculation to fail gracefully rather than creating a security issue. The commit improves code correctness and avoids compiler warnings about uninitialized variables, but does not fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
0bcf41171c642 drm/xe: Fix xe_tile_init_noalloc() error propagation
- [sasha] The code change shows: **Before:** ```c err = xe_tile_sysfs_init(tile); return 0; // Always returns success, ignoring any error ``` **After:** ```c return xe_tile_sysfs_init(tile); // Properly propagates error ``` This fixes a bug where sysfs initialization failures were being ignored, potentially leading to the system continuing with an incompletely initialized tile. Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar Commits 1-3 (CVE Status: NO): These are initialization sequence fixes, memory leak fixes, and similar robustness improvements that don't have security implications. - Similar Commits 4-5 (CVE Status: YES): These fix NULL pointer dereferences that could cause kernel crashes or undefined behavior during error conditions. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is an error handling bug where sysfs initialization failures are silently ignored 2. **Security implications**: While this could theoretically lead to system instability if sysfs creation fails and the system continues with incomplete initialization, there's no indication this creates exploitable conditions 3. **Impact assessment**: This appears to be a robustness/reliability fix rather than a security fix 4. **No crash/memory safety issues**: Unlike Similar Commits 4-5, this doesn't involve NULL pointer dereferences or memory safety issues 5. **Commit characteristics**: Similar to Similar Commits 1-3 in being an initialization/error handling improvement **NO** This commit fixes error propagation to improve robustness but does not address a security vulnerability. It ensures proper error handling during tile initialization but doesn't fix memory safety issues, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant problems that would warrant a CVE assignment.
5d02941c83997 clk: qcom: ipq5018: allow it to be bulid on arm32
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit against security criteria: **NO** This commit only modifies the Kconfig dependency for the IPQ5018 clock controller to allow it to be built on ARM32 (32-bit ARM) platforms in addition to the previously supported ARM64 platforms. The change: - From: `depends on ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST` - To: `depends on ARM || ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST` This is purely a build configuration change that: 1. **Does not fix any security vulnerability** - it expands platform support rather than addressing a security issue 2. **Does not introduce security risks** - it simply allows existing, functionally identical code to be compiled for ARM32 platforms 3. **No security-sensitive code changes** - the actual clock controller implementation remains unchanged 4. **Similar to reference commits** - this follows the same pattern as the provided "CVE Status: NO" examples, which are all Kconfig dependency fixes The commit message clearly states this is to enable firmware compatibility for devices that can only boot ARM32, which is a legitimate platform support enhancement, not a security fix.
4fd6ca90fc7f5 accel/amdxdna: Refactor hardware context destroy routine
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's the analysis: **Code Analysis:** The commit refactors the hardware context destroy routine to fix a potential race condition in the cleanup sequence, but this is **not a security vulnerability**: 1. **No security boundary crossed**: This affects internal driver state management during cleanup, not security-sensitive operations like access control, privilege escalation, or memory safety violations. 2. **Race condition is functional, not security-related**: The old code had potential issues with: - `drm_sched_wqueue_stop()` → `aie2_release_resource()` → `drm_sched_wqueue_start()` → `aie2_hwctx_wait_for_idle()` - This could lead to improper cleanup timing and potential resource leaks or functional failures. 3. **Improvement, not vulnerability fix**: The new code implements a more robust cleanup sequence: - Adds proper job counting (`job_submit_cnt`/`job_free_cnt`) - Implements timeout-based waiting (`dma_fence_wait_timeout` with 2-second limit) - Adds wait queue for job completion tracking - Ensures all jobs are properly freed before context destruction 4. **Comparing to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at Similar Commits 1, 3, and 5 that received CVEs, they fixed **Use-After-Free (UAF)** vulnerabilities where objects could be accessed after being freed, potentially leading to memory corruption or crashes. This commit addresses a **cleanup ordering issue**, not a UAF scenario. **Conclusion:** This is a robustness and reliability improvement that prevents resource leaks and ensures proper cleanup ordering, but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
4a6f18f28627e net/mlx4_core: Avoid impossible mlx4_db_alloc() order value
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Compiler Warning Fix**: The commit is explicitly fixing a GCC compiler warning (`-Warray-bounds`) that produces false positives, not an actual security issue. 2. **No Actual Bounds Violation**: Looking at the code, the `order` parameter in `mlx4_db_alloc()` and `mlx4_alloc_db_from_pgdir()` is used to index the `pgdir->bits[o]` array at line 669. The array `bits[2]` has only 2 elements (indices 0 and 1), and the loop constraint `o <= 1` ensures the index never exceeds 1. 3. **Input Validation Already Present**: The callers consistently pass values 0 or 1 for the order parameter, and the loop bounds ensure `o` never exceeds 1. 4. **Type Change Only**: The fix simply changes the parameter type from `int` to `unsigned int` to help the compiler understand that negative values are impossible, eliminating the false positive warning. 5. **Similar Pattern**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - compiler warning fixes that don't address actual security vulnerabilities. The change is purely cosmetic to silence compiler warnings and does not fix any exploitable security issue.
ff57025c35860 drm/xe: Stop ignoring errors from xe_ttm_stolen_mgr_init()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit is an error handling improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit changes `xe_ttm_stolen_mgr_init()` from a void function that silently ignored errors to an int function that properly propagates errors to the caller. This is a robustness improvement. 2. **Pre-existing NULL check**: The code already had a NULL check for the `mgr` pointer (added in commit a6eff8f9c7e8), so there was no risk of NULL pointer dereference when `drmm_kzalloc()` failed. 3. **Error handling behavior**: Before this commit, if initialization failed: - NULL allocation: Function returned early safely (due to existing NULL check) - `__xe_ttm_vram_mgr_init()` failure: Function logged error and returned early - The device probe would continue, but stolen memory functionality would simply be unavailable 4. **Impact assessment**: While ignoring initialization errors could lead to stolen memory functionality being unavailable, this doesn't create a security vulnerability. The driver would continue to function without stolen memory support, which is a valid operational state (as evidenced by the "No stolen memory support" debug message). 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commits that fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences, this commit addresses error propagation - a much less critical issue that doesn't directly lead to memory safety problems. The commit improves code quality and error handling but doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
6884d2051011f drm/xe/debugfs: fixed the return value of wedged_mode_set
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Let me provide my analysis: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **1. Clear Denial of Service Impact**: The commit message explicitly states that writing the same value twice to `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/wedged_mode` causes a "lockup". This represents a clear denial of service vulnerability where the system becomes unresponsive. **2. Technical Root Cause**: The bug occurs because the function incorrectly returns `size` instead of `0` when no change is needed. This violates POSIX write semantics where returning `0` indicates no bytes were consumed. User-space programs may retry the write operation indefinitely, creating an infinite loop that locks up the system. **3. Easy Reproduction**: The issue has a simple, deterministic reproduction case: ```bash echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/wedged_mode echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/wedged_mode # <- causes lockup ``` **4. Comparison to Historical CVEs**: This is similar to "Similar Commit 5" which received a CVE for a deadlock issue. Both involve system lockups/hangs caused by improper synchronization or return value handling. **5. Security Relevance**: While this requires root access to debugfs, CVEs are appropriately assigned for vulnerabilities that cause system lockups, even when requiring elevated privileges. The impact (complete system hang) justifies CVE assignment regardless of the access level required. The code change from `return 0;` to `return size;` fixes a fundamental violation of file I/O semantics that creates a denial of service condition through infinite retry loops in user-space.
ebdf7fe488c51 bnxt_en: Set NPAR 1.2 support when registering with firmware
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can determine whether it should be assigned a CVE. **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is a feature addition/enhancement to support NPAR (Network interface card partitioning) 1.2, not a security vulnerability fix. The code adds support for a new hardware capability. 2. **Specific Code Changes**: - Adds a new capability flag `BNXT_FW_CAP_NPAR_1_2` - Sets the appropriate flag when registering with firmware if the capability is supported - Adds recognition of the `FUNC_QCFG_RESP_PORT_PARTITION_TYPE_NPAR1_2` partition type 3. **Problem Being Solved**: The commit addresses a compatibility issue where the driver would fail to initialize on NPAR 1.2 NICs because it wasn't setting the proper support flag during firmware registration. This caused an initialization failure with error "hwrm req_type 0x1d seq id 0xb error 0x2". 4. **No Security Implications**: - There are no memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No privilege escalation concerns - No access control bypasses - No information disclosure vulnerabilities - This is purely a driver compatibility/functionality fix 5. **Pattern Comparison**: This follows the pattern of similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's adding support for new hardware features, similar to the "Support new 5760X P7 devices" commit in the reference examples. The commit is fixing a driver initialization failure on specific hardware configurations, not addressing any security vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers.
f7cd9c94959e7 media: stm32: csi: add missing pm_runtime_put on error
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific issue. The key issue here is understanding what happens when pm_runtime_get_sync() succeeds but subsequent function calls fail. **NO** This commit fixes a runtime power management resource leak, not a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Issue Type**: This is a resource management bug where `pm_runtime_get_sync()` increases the device's runtime PM reference count, but if subsequent operations fail (like `clk_get_rate()` returning 0 or `stm32_csi_setup_lane_merger()` failing), the function would return without calling `pm_runtime_put()` to balance the reference count. 2. **Impact**: The missing `pm_runtime_put()` calls would leave the device in an artificially elevated power state, preventing proper power management. This could lead to: - Increased power consumption - Device remaining powered when it should be suspended - Resource leak affecting system power management 3. **No Security Implications**: This bug does not: - Allow unauthorized access to memory or system resources - Enable privilege escalation - Create buffer overflows or memory corruption - Expose sensitive information - Allow bypassing of access controls 4. **Similar Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all deal with similar resource management issues (missing error checks, missing cleanup calls) and are marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the exact same pattern of fixing proper cleanup in error paths. The fix properly consolidates error handling using a `goto error_put` label that ensures `pm_runtime_put()` is called in all error scenarios, which is a standard kernel pattern for resource cleanup.
a3a91b6e62be2 media: stm32: csi: use ARRAY_SIZE to search D-PHY table
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit in detail: **Analysis:** This commit makes several changes to the STM32 CSI (Camera Serial Interface) driver: 1. **Removes sentinel entry**: The commit removes `{ /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var sentinel */ }` from the `snps_stm32mp25` array 2. **Changes loop logic**: Instead of iterating until `phy_regs->mbps != 0` (relying on the sentinel), it uses `ARRAY_SIZE(snps_stm32mp25)` to properly bound the loop 3. **Initializes pointer to NULL**: Changes `phy_regs` initialization and checks `if (!phy_regs)` instead of `if (!phy_regs->mbps)` 4. **Minor code cleanup**: Removes redundant initialization of `lanes_ie` and `lanes_en` variables **Security Assessment:** **NO** This is a code cleanup/refactoring commit that does NOT fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **No buffer overflow risk**: The original code had a sentinel entry that properly terminated the loop. The new code uses `ARRAY_SIZE()` which provides the same safe bounds checking. 2. **No memory safety issue**: Both the old and new implementations are memory-safe. The original relied on a sentinel value to terminate the loop, while the new version uses explicit array bounds. 3. **Functionality unchanged**: The commit message explicitly states this is for using `ARRAY_SIZE` and avoiding "useless init" - indicating this is purely a code style/efficiency improvement. 4. **No access control or privilege implications**: This affects only PHY register configuration in a media driver. 5. **Similar to reference commit #2**: This closely resembles the "phy: marvell: a3700-comphy: Fix hardcoded array size" commit which was marked as CVE Status: NO. Both replace hardcoded array iteration with `ARRAY_SIZE()` for better code practices. This is a code quality improvement that makes the loop bounds more explicit and removes dependency on sentinel values, but it does not fix any security vulnerability.
71dfb2c754899 media: i2c: ov2740: Free control handler on error path
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. Let me summarize what I understand: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit is a typical memory leak fix in error handling paths. Here's the analysis: 1. **The Issue**: The commit fixes a memory leak where `v4l2_ctrl_handler_init()` allocates resources for the control handler at line 777, but if `v4l2_fwnode_device_parse()` fails at line 828, the function returns without calling `v4l2_ctrl_handler_free()` to clean up the allocated control handler resources. 2. **The Fix**: The commit adds a call to `v4l2_ctrl_handler_free(ctrl_hdlr)` before returning the error when `v4l2_fwnode_device_parse()` fails. 3. **Impact Assessment**: - This is a **resource leak** issue, not a security vulnerability - The leak only occurs in an error path during device initialization - No memory corruption, buffer overflow, or privilege escalation is involved - This is contained within the camera sensor driver initialization code - Similar to the reference commits provided (all marked CVE Status: NO), this is a clean-up/resource management fix 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits are also resource management fixes (missing error handling, cleanup on error paths, memory leaks) and are marked with "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **Security Relevance**: While memory leaks can theoretically contribute to DoS conditions, this particular leak: - Only occurs during device probe failure - Is in camera driver code (not core kernel functionality) - Is bounded (single allocation per probe attempt) - Cannot be triggered arbitrarily by unprivileged users This is a quality improvement and resource management fix, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
91d6a99acfa5c media: v4l: Memset argument to 0 before calling get_mbus_config pad op
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Analysis:** This commit adds a `memset(config, 0, sizeof(*config))` call before calling the `get_mbus_config` operation on V4L2 sub-devices. The purpose is to ensure the config structure is properly initialized before being passed to driver implementations. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Defensive Programming, Not a Fix**: This is a defensive programming measure to ensure consistent behavior across drivers. The commit message explicitly states this is to ensure "callers don't need to bother with it nor the implementations need to set all fields that may not be relevant to them." 2. **No Evidence of Exploitation**: There's no indication this fixes an actual vulnerability where uninitialized memory was being leaked to userspace or causing security issues. The change is preventative. 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, all were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar code cleanup/improvement rather than security fixes: - Commit 1: API consolidation (`devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource()`) - Commit 2: Comment correction - Commit 3: Optimization to avoid memset of entire structure - Commit 4: Bug fix for wrong pointer usage - Commit 5: DMA mapping API changes 4. **Structure Analysis**: The `v4l2_mbus_config` structure (found at `/home/sasha/linux/include/media/v4l2-mediabus.h:185`) contains an enum type, a u64 link_freq, and a union of bus configurations. While uninitialized fields could theoretically contain stack data, this appears to be a proactive measure rather than fixing a demonstrated leak. 5. **API Improvement**: The documentation update clearly indicates this is an API contract improvement, making it explicit that the config argument is zeroed before calling the operation. This is a code quality improvement that ensures consistent initialization of the config parameter, but there's no evidence it addresses an actual security vulnerability or information disclosure.
611160b02a40c drm/xe/pf: Release all VFs configs on device removal
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Resource Management Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a resource cleanup problem during driver unload, not a security flaw. The error messages show memory manager complaints, GGTT node leaks, and GUC ID/doorbell manager cleanup issues - these are resource management problems. 2. **No Security Impact**: The code changes add a `fini_config()` cleanup function that properly releases VF (Virtual Function) configurations during device removal. This prevents resource leaks but doesn't address any security boundaries, access controls, or privilege escalation issues. 3. **Driver Unload Context**: The issue only occurs during manual driver unload after VF provisioning via debugfs. This is an administrative operation that doesn't expose attack vectors to unprivileged users. 4. **Cleanup Fix Pattern**: The fix follows a standard pattern of adding cleanup handlers (`devm_add_action_or_reset`) to ensure proper resource deallocation. This is typical maintenance code, not security hardening. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This resembles the "NO CVE" reference commits that fix resource management issues, configuration problems, or driver lifecycle bugs without security implications. The commit addresses a resource leak during driver teardown, which is a reliability/maintenance issue rather than a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
e3b82d49bf676 media: i2c: imx219: Correct the minimum vblanking value
- [sasha] Based on this analysis, let me examine the similar commits provided to understand the pattern. Looking at the changes: 1. **Code Change Analysis**: The commit changes `IMX219_VBLANK_MIN` from 4 to 32 lines, which affects the minimum allowable vertical blanking period for the IMX219 camera sensor. 2. **Functionality Impact**: The vblank value directly controls the frame length register (IMX219_REG_FRM_LENGTH_A) through the formula `(format->height + ctrl->val) / rate_factor`. An incorrect minimum could allow invalid frame timing that doesn't match the hardware specifications. 3. **Security Implications**: - This is a hardware timing parameter correction, not a memory safety issue - There are no buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - The V4L2 control framework provides bounds checking using the min/max values - Invalid vblank values would cause image artifacts (like the mentioned "black lines") but not security vulnerabilities 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - All the provided similar commits (imx412 exposure, ov9282 exposure offset, imx290 register settings, imx214 format handling, imx412 newlines) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - These commits all deal with camera sensor parameter corrections, formatting fixes, or hardware register adjustments - None involve memory safety, privilege escalation, or other security-critical issues **NO** This commit corrects a hardware timing parameter (minimum vblank value) based on datasheet specifications to fix image quality issues. It's a straightforward hardware configuration fix similar to the other camera sensor commits that were not assigned CVEs. The change affects only image timing parameters and has no security implications - it doesn't involve memory safety, access control, privilege escalation, or any other security-relevant functionality.
c7fb50cecff9c smack: Revert "smackfs: Added check catlen"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the additional context from the kernel tree, here's my assessment: **NO** This revert commit should **not** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Bug Fix Rather Than Security Issue**: The commit message explicitly states this is reverting a previous change that "introduces a bug" - specifically that it "forever clears NETLBL_SECATTR_MLS_CAT in (struct smack_known *)skp->smk_netlabel.flags". This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Incorrect Flag Management**: The original commit being reverted had a problematic line `skp->smk_netlabel.flags &= ~(1U << 3);` which incorrectly clears the NETLBL_SECATTR_MLS_CAT flag permanently. Looking at the current code, I can see proper flag management where the flag is set/cleared based on whether `ncats.attr.mls.cat` exists. 3. **Restores Proper Function**: The revert removes special case handling for `catlen == 0` that was bypassing the normal `smk_netlbl_mls()` function. The `smk_netlbl_mls()` function properly sets `sap->flags |= NETLBL_SECATTR_MLS_CAT` and handles empty category sets correctly. 4. **No Security Impact**: The bug being fixed relates to improper state management in security label processing, but doesn't appear to create a security bypass, privilege escalation, or information disclosure vulnerability. It's more of a functional correctness issue in the SMACK security module. The commit is reverting a broken implementation to restore the original, working behavior rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
c98868e816209 pinctrl: devicetree: do not goto err when probing hogs in pinctrl_dt_to_map
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Functional Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional issue where hogged pins and non-hogged pins cannot coexist within the same device-tree node. This is a configuration/functionality problem, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Change Analysis**: The fix changes the return value from `-ENODEV` to `1` in the hog detection case (line 153: `return 1;`) and adds handling for this special return value (line 272-273: `if (ret == 1) continue;`). This allows the parsing to continue rather than aborting with an error. 3. **No Security Impact**: - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or memory leaks are fixed - No access control bypasses or privilege escalation issues - No input validation vulnerabilities - No race conditions or use-after-free scenarios 4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs all fixed clear security issues: - Memory leaks from missing `fwnode_handle_put()` calls - Double-free vulnerabilities - Deadlock conditions that could cause denial of service 5. **Nature of the Fix**: This commit resolves a design limitation in the pinctrl framework that prevented certain valid device-tree configurations from working properly. It's a robustness improvement, not a security fix. The commit improves system functionality and prevents configuration errors, but does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
1c3b5f3740968 ASoC: tas2764: Power up/down amp on mute ops
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Change:** The commit modifies the TAS2764 audio codec driver to change the timing of power management operations. It moves power up/down logic from DAPM events (`tas2764_dac_event`) into the mute operations (`tas2764_mute`) to better align with ASoC conventions. **What the Fix Addresses:** - **Clock Management Issue**: The commit fixes TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) clock errors that occur when audio streams are stopped - **Timing Coordination**: Ensures the amplifier is in software shutdown before clocks are removed, preventing hardware errors - **Driver Architecture**: Aligns the driver with ASoC conventions where clocks are removed after codec mute **Security Analysis:** 1. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes involve reorganizing existing power management calls, not fixing buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access violations 2. **No Access Control Changes**: No modifications to privilege levels, permissions, or security boundaries 3. **No Input Validation**: No changes related to validating untrusted input or preventing injection attacks 4. **Hardware Error Prevention**: This is purely about preventing hardware clock errors, not security vulnerabilities **Similar Pattern Analysis:** Looking at the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this commit follows the same pattern - it's a functional fix for hardware operation (similar to power control masks, clock configurations, and audio processing improvements) rather than a security vulnerability. The commit addresses a hardware compatibility and driver stability issue, not a security flaw that could be exploited maliciously.
783db6851c182 ASoC: ops: Enforce platform maximum on initial value
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code context, let me evaluate whether this should receive a CVE: ## Analysis **What the commit does:** The commit adds a new function `snd_soc_clip_to_platform_max()` that enforces platform maximum limits on audio volume controls at initialization time. This function: 1. Reads the current volume value using `kctl->get()` 2. Checks if either channel exceeds the `platform_max` limit 3. If so, clips the value to `platform_max` 4. Writes the corrected value back using `kctl->put()` **Security considerations:** 1. **This is NOT a security vulnerability fix** - This commit is adding functionality to enforce proper volume limiting at initialization, not fixing a security flaw. 2. **No bounds checking violation** - Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs, this commit doesn't fix missing bounds validation that could lead to out-of-bounds writes. Instead, it adds proactive enforcement of platform limits. 3. **Functionality enhancement** - The commit ensures that when `snd_soc_limit_volume()` is called, not only is the `platform_max` limit set, but any existing volume values that violate this limit are immediately corrected. 4. **No memory safety issues** - The code doesn't address buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other memory safety issues. 5. **No privilege escalation** - This doesn't fix any access control or privilege issues. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits:** - The similar commits that received CVEs were all fixing **missing bounds validation** that allowed userspace to write out-of-bounds values - Those commits added validation to **reject** invalid values - This commit adds functionality to **correct** values proactively, not fix a validation gap **NO** This commit adds a feature to proactively enforce volume limits at initialization time, but does not fix a security vulnerability. It enhances functionality rather than addressing a security flaw like missing bounds validation or potential buffer overflows that characterized the CVE-assigned similar commits.
0e8934724f786 io_uring: use IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS more
- [sasha] That file isn't relevant to the commit I need to analyze. Let me examine the actual commit changes: The commit makes simple refactoring changes to io_uring code: 1. **Moves macro definition**: Moves `#define IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS (REQ_F_LINK | REQ_F_HARDLINK)` to be defined earlier in the file (line 96) 2. **Replaces literal flags with macro**: In two places, replaces the literal `REQ_F_LINK | REQ_F_HARDLINK` with the `IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS` macro: - Line 119: `#define IO_REQ_CLEAN_SLOW_FLAGS (REQ_F_REFCOUNT | IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS | \` - Line 1161: `if (req->flags & IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS)` **Analysis:** This is a pure code cleanup/refactoring commit that: - Does not change any functionality or behavior - Does not fix any bugs or vulnerabilities - Simply improves code consistency by using an existing macro instead of repeating the literal flag combination - The macro `IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS` was already defined and used elsewhere in the codebase Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar Commits 1-3 were marked "CVE Status: YES" but those involved actual functional changes to io_uring (splitting functions, removing SCM_RIGHTS support) - Similar Commits 4-5 were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar cleanup/refactoring changes like this one **NO** This is a pure code cleanup commit that replaces hardcoded flag combinations with an existing macro for consistency. It introduces no functional changes, fixes no bugs, and addresses no security vulnerabilities - it simply improves code maintainability by using `IO_REQ_LINK_FLAGS` instead of writing `REQ_F_LINK | REQ_F_HARDLINK` directly.
d64c4c3d1c578 ASoC: tas2764: Add reg defaults for TAS2764_INT_CLK_CFG
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** The commit adds a missing register default value for `TAS2764_INT_CLK_CFG` (Clock/IRQ Settings register) to the `tas2764_reg_defaults[]` array, setting it to `0x19`. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Simple register default addition**: This is adding a missing default value that should have been included in the original register defaults table. The register itself already exists and is properly handled in the code. 2. **No functional security impact**: The `TAS2764_INT_CLK_CFG` register is used for interrupt clearing in fault conditions (via the `IRQZ_CLR` bit). Adding its default value doesn't change any security-sensitive behavior or fix a vulnerability. 3. **Hardware initialization improvement**: This change ensures the register has a proper default value during driver initialization, which is a hardware configuration improvement rather than a security fix. 4. **Pattern matches non-CVE similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this commit follows the same pattern of: - Adding missing register defaults/values - Fixing compilation warnings - Correcting register configuration tables - Simple hardware configuration improvements 5. **No exploitation potential**: There's no indication this was fixing a condition that could be exploited maliciously. It's a straightforward driver improvement to ensure proper register initialization. This is a routine driver maintenance commit that improves hardware initialization consistency, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
5abc174016052 firmware: xilinx: Dont send linux address to get fpga config get status
- [sasha] Now let me understand what the security issue is here. The key problem is: 1. Before the fix: The function was passing `lower_addr` and `upper_addr` which were derived from a Linux kernel virtual address (`&buf`) to the firmware via SMC call 2. After the fix: The function passes 0, 0 instead of the address The commit message states: "Moreover, the address that is being passed till now is linux virtual address and is incorrect." This suggests that: 1. Kernel virtual addresses should not be passed to firmware/secure world 2. The firmware was potentially trying to access memory using a Linux virtual address, which could lead to improper memory access Let me examine the security implications more closely: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message indicates this is a functional fix, not a security fix. The firmware side was also modified to "avoid using the address sent by linux," indicating this was coordinated change to fix functionality rather than patch a vulnerability. 2. **Information disclosure without exploitation**: While passing kernel virtual addresses to firmware is poor practice and could theoretically leak ASLR information, there's no indication that: - The firmware could actually use these addresses to access kernel memory - This led to any memory corruption or unauthorized access - Any actual security boundary was crossed 3. **API design issue, not vulnerability**: The function was unnecessarily passing an address when the data was already being returned via `ret_payload[1]`. This appears to be an API design flaw rather than a security vulnerability. 4. **No similar precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that only fix functional issues, API cleanup, or incorrect parameter passing (without security impact) are consistently marked as "CVE Status: NO." 5. **Coordinated firmware changes**: The mention that "corresponding modification has been done in the firmware" suggests this was a planned API cleanup rather than an emergency security fix. The fix improves the API design and removes unnecessary information leakage, but there's no evidence this constituted an exploitable security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
2f622a8b0722d firmware: arm_ffa: Handle the presence of host partition in the partition info
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **Duplicate prevention, not vulnerability fix**: The code change adds a check (`xa_load(&drv_info->partition_info, drv_info->vm_id)`) to prevent duplicate host partition allocation, returning early if already present. 2. **Existing protections**: The ARM FFA driver already has multiple layers of duplicate detection with proper error handling (`-EEXIST` codes), indicating this is defensive programming rather than fixing an exploitable condition. 3. **Resource management optimization**: The fix prevents unnecessary allocation attempts and potential resource waste, but doesn't address memory corruption, privilege escalation, or security boundary violations. 4. **Functional robustness**: While the ARM FFA subsystem manages security-critical partition isolation between Secure/Non-Secure worlds, this specific change improves system robustness rather than fixing a security exploit path. The commit is preventive maintenance that reduces resource consumption and improves code reliability, but doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it's not fixing an exploitable security vulnerability.
9dd3d5d258ace net/mlx5: Apply rate-limiting to high temperature warning
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Code Change Analysis:** The commit simply wraps an existing warning message with `net_ratelimit()` to prevent log flooding: ```c // Before: mlx5_core_warn(events->dev, "High temperature on sensors..."); // After: if (net_ratelimit()) mlx5_core_warn(events->dev, "High temperature on sensors..."); ``` **Why this is NOT a security issue:** 1. **No security vulnerability fixed**: This addresses a log flooding issue, not a security boundary violation, memory safety issue, or privilege escalation. 2. **Operational fix, not security fix**: The commit prevents excessive logging when temperature warnings occur repeatedly, which is purely an operational reliability improvement. 3. **No sensitive components affected**: This only affects logging behavior, not memory management, access control, input validation, or other security-critical functionality. 4. **Similar pattern in reference commits**: This is nearly identical to Similar Commit 3 which also adds rate limiting (`dev_err_ratelimited`) to prevent log flooding and was correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO". 5. **No exploitation potential**: Log flooding, while potentially disruptive to system operations, does not create exploitable security vulnerabilities that would warrant CVE assignment. The commit addresses a quality-of-life operational issue rather than a security flaw.
efff6a7f16b34 firmware: arm_ffa: Reject higher major version as incompatible
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding. Let me analyze the security implications: **NO** This commit fixes a compatibility checking issue but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Non-Security Issue**: The commit addresses a firmware version compatibility problem, not a security flaw. Before this commit, the driver would incorrectly accept firmware with a higher major version and attempt to downgrade it using `ffa_compatible_version_find()`, which could lead to undefined behavior but not security exploits. 2. **Defensive Programming**: The change adds proper validation to reject incompatible major versions early, which is standard defensive programming practice. The FFA specification requires that if firmware cannot work in a compatible mode, it should return `NOT_SUPPORTED`, but this change adds a driver-side check for robustness. 3. **No Attack Vector**: The previous behavior (accepting higher major versions) did not create an exploitable security vulnerability. It was a compatibility issue that could cause functional problems but not privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant issues. 4. **Similar Pattern to References**: This follows the same pattern as the reference commits marked "NO" - it's a firmware interface correctness fix, similar to the arm_ffa casting fixes in the reference commits. 5. **No Security Context**: The commit message and code changes show no indication of security concerns, vulnerability fixes, or security-sensitive component modifications. It's purely about protocol version compatibility enforcement. The commit improves system reliability by preventing potential undefined behavior with incompatible firmware versions, but does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
7f1186a8d7386 ASoC: soc-dai: check return value at snd_soc_dai_set_tdm_slot()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the Linux kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This is a **defensive programming improvement** rather than a security vulnerability fix. The commit adds proper return value checking to `snd_soc_dai_set_tdm_slot()` for the `xlate_tdm_slot_mask` callback functions. ## Key Findings 1. **No active security vulnerability**: The commit author explicitly states this "patch might break existing driver" suggesting it's a proactive improvement rather than fixing an existing bug. 2. **Current implementations are safe**: My examination of the kernel tree shows that: - The default `snd_soc_xlate_tdm_slot_mask()` only returns `-EINVAL` for invalid input (slots=0) or `0` for success - Very few drivers implement custom `xlate_tdm_slot_mask` callbacks, and those that do are simple no-op functions 3. **No evidence of exploitable condition**: Unlike the CVE-worthy examples provided (null pointer dereferences, memory leaks, deadlocks), this commit addresses: - Missing error handling for a function that rarely fails - A theoretical code path that could lead to undefined behavior only if a driver returned an error that was previously ignored 4. **Pattern comparison**: This resembles Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE) which was also about fixing return types and error handling as a code quality improvement, not Similar Commits 1-2 (YES CVE) which fixed actual null pointer dereferences and crashes. ## Code Changes Assessment The changes are purely defensive: - Added `ret =` assignments to capture return values - Added `if (ret) goto err;` to check and handle errors - Added proper error propagation through existing error handling paths No memory safety issues, access control bypasses, or other security-critical patterns are present. **Conclusion**: This is a code quality and robustness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
92a3bac9a57c3 io_uring: sanitise ring params earlier
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a code refactoring and hardening improvement, not a fix for a specific security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** The commit moves parameter validation logic from `io_uring_fill_params()` and `io_uring_create()` into a new dedicated function `io_uring_sanitise_params()` and calls it earlier in the initialization process. The key observations are: 1. **No vulnerability fix**: The validation logic itself remains identical - it's just moved to execute earlier 2. **Code refactoring**: The commit message explicitly states this is about making "initialisation easier" and having "fewer places where we need to care about partial de-initialisation" 3. **Defensive programming**: Moving validation earlier prevents unnecessary resource allocation for invalid parameters, but this is hardening, not fixing an exploitable bug 4. **No security indicators**: The commit message contains no security-related keywords or mentions of fixes Comparing to the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) fixed an actual bug where provided buffers could be corrupted during async preparation - This commit only moves existing validation code without changing its logic While this is good security engineering practice (fail-fast validation), it doesn't fix a specific exploitable vulnerability that would meet CVE criteria.
999f458c17713 irqchip/riscv-imsic: Set irq_set_affinity() for IMSIC base
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific changes shown in the commit: Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here's my security assessment: **NO** This commit is a refactoring change that fixes a layering violation in the interrupt handling code, not a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Code Architecture Fix**: The commit moves the `imsic_irq_set_affinity()` callback from leaf MSI domains to the base IMSIC domain, which is the proper architectural layering. This prevents calling the function with incorrect domain data. 2. **No Security Impact**: The changes are: - Moving `irq_set_affinity = imsic_irq_set_affinity` from leaf domains to the base chip (`imsic_irq_base_chip`) - Replacing leaf domain affinity handling with `irq_chip_set_affinity_parent()` which properly delegates to the parent 3. **Data Access Changes Are Safe**: The key changes in `imsic_irq_set_affinity()`: - Changed from `d->parent_data` to `d` for accessing chip data - Changed from updating parent IRQ data to updating current IRQ data - These changes align with the new calling context and don't introduce security risks 4. **Functional Equivalence**: The commit maintains the same interrupt affinity functionality but with correct layering. The `irq_chip_set_affinity_parent()` call ensures the same affinity function is ultimately called, just through the proper domain hierarchy. 5. **No Memory Safety Issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues are being fixed. This is a code quality improvement for interrupt controller layering, similar to the non-CVE reference commits that fix output text or wire up callbacks correctly.
e4740118b7520 media: test-drivers: vivid: don't call schedule in loop
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this commit: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a performance/efficiency bug, not a security vulnerability. The problematic code creates a busy-loop that consumes 100% CPU when capturing from the vivid test driver at low resolution. 2. **Code analysis**: The vulnerable pattern is: ```c while (time_is_after_jiffies(cur_jiffies + wait_jiffies) && !kthread_should_stop()) schedule(); ``` When no other processes can be scheduled, this becomes a busy-loop that wastes CPU cycles. 3. **Impact assessment**: - This affects the **vivid test driver** (`Virtual Video Test Driver`), which is specifically a test driver, not production hardware - The impact is limited to excessive CPU usage (DoS-like behavior) but only affects the local system - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other traditional security vulnerabilities are present 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar Commits 1-3 (CVE Status: YES) involve **buffer overflow fixes** and **boundary checking** - these are classic security vulnerabilities - Similar Commits 4-5 (CVE Status: NO) involve **synchronization improvements** and **time handling fixes** - performance/correctness issues like this one 5. **Fix analysis**: The fix replaces the busy-loop with proper `wait_event_interruptible_timeout()`, which is a standard kernel synchronization primitive that doesn't busy-wait. This is a quality-of-implementation issue that improves system performance and resource utilization, but does not fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes.
633f16d7e07c1 net/mlx5: Modify LSB bitmask in temperature event to include only the first bit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and the broader context from the kernel tree, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds a bitmask operation (`value_lsb &= 0x1`) to filter out unwanted bits from a temperature warning event handler. This is purely a cosmetic/correctness fix to prevent confusing output. 2. **No security vulnerability**: This change: - Does not fix any buffer overflow, memory corruption, or access control issues - Does not prevent any privilege escalation or unauthorized access - Does not fix any input validation vulnerability - Does not address any race conditions or memory leaks 3. **Impact is informational only**: The temperature warning handler only: - Logs warning messages to the kernel log - Calls `print_sensor_names_in_bit_set()` for additional diagnostic output - Returns `NOTIFY_OK` - it doesn't affect any security-sensitive operations 4. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is very similar to the provided reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO", particularly in that it's a minor correctness fix in a driver without security implications. 5. **Purpose is clarity, not security**: The commit message explicitly states the purpose is "to prevent confusing output" - this is clearly about improving the quality of diagnostic information, not fixing a security flaw. The change only affects the bits that are processed for logging purposes and has no impact on system security, access control, or data integrity.
cccf6ee090c8c ACPI: HED: Always initialize before evged
- [sasha] **NO** This commit addresses an initialization ordering issue but does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit changes HED (Hardware Error Device) from `tristate` to `bool` in Kconfig and modifies the initialization from `module_acpi_driver()` to `subsys_initcall()` to ensure HED initializes before evged. 2. **Root cause**: The issue is that when both drivers are built-in at the same initcall level, Makefile order determines initialization sequence. RAS (Reliability, Availability, Serviceability) records arriving between evged and HED initialization may exhaust HEST resources, affecting subsequent error reporting. 3. **Impact analysis**: While this affects RAS error reporting reliability, it does not create a security vulnerability. The commit prevents resource exhaustion of HEST error sources, which is a reliability/functionality issue rather than a security issue. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: This mirrors similar commit #4 (CXL port initialization order) which was marked CVE Status: NO. Both address initialization ordering to prevent functional issues without security implications. 5. **No security-sensitive components**: The changes don't involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, access control bypass, or other security-relevant patterns. It's purely about ensuring proper hardware error reporting functionality. The commit improves system reliability by ensuring proper RAS error handling but does not address any exploitable security vulnerability.
d42d543368343 vxlan: Join / leave MC group after remote changes
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit for security implications. Based on my analysis of the commit, I can make an informed decision. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ## Analysis Summary **What this commit does:** The commit fixes a functional bug in VXLAN where multicast group membership was not being properly updated when remote addresses or interfaces changed during runtime configuration. Previously, when changing the multicast remote address, the device would stay subscribed to the old multicast group and join the new one, potentially causing traffic to be received from both groups. **Key code changes:** 1. **Lines 4450-4453**: Adds logic to detect when IGMP group changes are needed (`change_igmp` flag) 2. **Lines 4500-4501**: Calls `vxlan_multicast_leave()` before applying configuration changes 3. **Lines 4511-4513**: Calls `vxlan_multicast_join()` after applying configuration changes **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security**: This addresses improper multicast group management, which is a networking functionality issue, not a security exploit. The old behavior caused devices to remain in old multicast groups unnecessarily, but didn't expose sensitive data or create exploitable conditions. 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The commit doesn't involve access control, authentication, or privilege boundaries. It's purely about network multicast group membership. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: There are no buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption issues in this change. 4. **Administrative Operation**: Changing VXLAN configuration requires administrative privileges (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`), so this is not exploitable by unprivileged users. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the "CVE Status: NO" reference commits which deal with network configuration fixes rather than security vulnerabilities. The commit aligns with the reference commits that received "CVE Status: NO" - it's a functional networking fix that improves proper protocol behavior rather than addressing a security flaw that could be exploited maliciously.
f99c5bb396b8d posix-timers: Invoke cond_resched() during exit_itimers()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit based on the code changes and context: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Performance Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a softlockup issue that occurs when a process with hundreds of thousands of timers exits on `CONFIG_PREEMPT=n` systems. This is a performance/availability problem, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Analysis**: The change adds `cond_resched()` in the timer deletion loop in `exit_itimers()`. This function call allows voluntary preemption to prevent the kernel from becoming unresponsive - it's a scheduling optimization, not a security fix. 3. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The issue affects system responsiveness but doesn't: - Allow privilege escalation - Cause memory corruption - Enable unauthorized access - Leak sensitive information - Bypass access controls 4. **Similar Commit Pattern**: This follows the pattern of Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 which are all marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are performance optimizations or fixes to prevent system hangs/lockups rather than security vulnerabilities. 5. **Limited Attack Surface**: While an attacker could theoretically create many timers to cause a DoS via softlockup, this would require the attacker to already have code execution capabilities, and the impact is limited to system responsiveness rather than security compromise. The commit fixes a legitimate performance regression but doesn't address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
bbbc02b7445eb bpf: copy_verifier_state() should copy 'loop_entry' field
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and security implications: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Security Impact**: This is a verification bypass vulnerability. The commit message explicitly states that without this fix, "programs that are not safe yet are accepted by verifier." The BPF verifier is the primary security boundary for eBPF programs, so any correctness issue that allows unsafe programs to pass verification is a security vulnerability. 2. **Technical Analysis**: The missing `dst_state->loop_entry = src->loop_entry;` line in `copy_verifier_state()` causes "state pollution" where new verifier states inherit stale loop entry values from unrelated states. This corrupts the loop detection algorithm, which is critical for: - Preventing infinite loops - Ensuring iterator safety - Proper state space exploration 3. **Attack Vector**: An attacker could craft malicious eBPF programs that exploit this state pollution to bypass loop safety checks, potentially leading to: - Denial of service through infinite loops - Resource exhaustion - Violation of eBPF's fundamental safety guarantees 4. **Reference to Similar CVEs**: Looking at the similar commits provided, those marked "CVE Status: YES" were related to BPF verifier correctness issues that could lead to unsafe program acceptance, which is exactly what this commit addresses. 5. **Scope of Impact**: The commit affects core BPF verifier functionality that impacts all eBPF programs using iterators or complex loop structures, making this a systemic issue rather than an edge case. The code change itself is minimal (adding one line), but the security implications are significant because it undermines the correctness of the BPF verification process, which is essential for maintaining kernel security when loading eBPF programs.
8fdeafd66edaf eth: mlx4: don't try to complete XDP frames in netpoll
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a legitimate issue, this is a correctness/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Issue Type**: The commit prevents XDP frame completion during netpoll (when NAPI budget = 0) to avoid context issues with page pool operations that have calling context requirements. 2. **Security Impact**: Limited - this primarily prevents potential system hangs/deadlocks during debugging scenarios (netconsole, kgdb) rather than addressing a security boundary violation. 3. **Attack Surface**: Requires local access to trigger netpoll, specific hardware (mlx4), and XDP configuration - not remotely exploitable. 4. **Pattern Recognition**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 2 and 5 (both marked CVE Status: YES), which involve similar netpoll/XDP context fixes in the sfc driver. However, those commits had different characteristics that made them more security-relevant. 5. **Code Change**: The simple check `if (unlikely(!napi_budget) && cq->type == TX_XDP) return 0;` prevents processing XDP completions when budget is zero, which is a defensive programming practice rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. This represents a **correctness fix** for driver robustness during debugging scenarios, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
6568cb40e7316 pmdomain: imx: gpcv2: use proper helper for property detection
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Impact**: This is a purely functional fix that addresses warning messages, not a security vulnerability. The change is from `of_property_read_bool()` to `of_property_present()` for checking if a "power-domains" property exists. 2. **Similar to Non-CVE Example**: This commit is nearly identical to "Similar Commit 3" which was marked as [CVE Status: NO]. Both commits fix the exact same type of issue - using the proper helper function for property detection to avoid warnings introduced by commit c141ecc3cecd7. 3. **No Functional Change**: The code behavior remains exactly the same. Both functions check for property existence, but `of_property_present()` is the correct helper to use for property detection rather than `of_property_read_bool()`. 4. **Context**: The change only affects lockdep subclass setting (`lockdep_set_subclass(&domain->genpd.mlock, 1)`), which is a debugging/development feature, not a security-critical operation. 5. **No Memory, Access Control, or Critical System Impact**: The fix doesn't address buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, race conditions, or any other security-relevant patterns. This is a code quality improvement to use the proper API, not a security fix.
9e63fdb0cbdf3 bpf: don't do clean_live_states when state->loop_entry->branches > 0
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific code changes and compare them to the similar commits to make my determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Performance/Correctness Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit message and code changes clearly indicate this is a performance optimization that fixes verification convergence issues, not a security vulnerability. The commit states: "This undoes negative verification performance impact" and shows dramatic performance improvements in the metrics. 2. **No Security Implications in the Fix**: The added check `if (loop_entry && loop_entry->branches)` is preventing premature cleaning of verifier states to improve loop convergence logic. This is about verifier efficiency and correctness, not security boundaries. The code prevents `clean_verifier_state()` from running when loop branches are still active, which is a correctness issue for verification performance. 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - The "YES" CVE commits fix actual verification bypass vulnerabilities in precision tracking and may_goto handling that could allow unsafe programs to pass verification - The "NO" CVE commits are about correctness fixes and test improvements without security implications - This commit aligns with the "NO" pattern - it's fixing verification logic for correctness/performance, not preventing a security bypass 4. **Technical Analysis**: While my comprehensive analysis identified potential theoretical security implications, the actual code change is fundamentally about preventing inefficient state cleaning that hurts verification performance. The `clean_live_states` function is an optimization that removes dead state information - preventing it from running when loop branches are active is about maintaining verification correctness, not security boundaries. 5. **Context from Commit Message**: The commit explicitly focuses on verification performance metrics and states this "undoes negative verification performance impact," indicating this is primarily a performance/correctness fix rather than a security patch. The fix ensures proper loop convergence by not cleaning states prematurely, which is important for verifier correctness but does not constitute a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
ab1bc2290fd83 can: c_can: Use of_property_present() to test existence of DT property
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a code quality improvement, not a security fix. The change replaces `of_property_read_bool()` with `of_property_present()` when checking for the existence of the "syscon-raminit" device tree property. **Analysis:** 1. **No Security Impact**: The "syscon-raminit" property is used to determine if custom RAM initialization is needed via syscon for TI platforms. This is a hardware configuration setting that doesn't affect security boundaries. 2. **Functional Equivalence**: Both functions return the same boolean result for property existence checking. The change is purely about using the correct API - `of_property_present()` for general property existence vs `of_property_read_bool()` for actual boolean properties. 3. **Code Quality Fix**: This aligns with kernel coding standards where `of_property_read_bool()` usage on non-boolean properties is deprecated. The commit message explicitly states this is to correct improper API usage. 4. **No Vulnerability Pattern**: Unlike the CVE-marked similar commit that fixed an out-of-bounds read in the CAN subsystem, this change doesn't address any memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security vulnerabilities. 5. **Similar Pattern**: This follows the same pattern as the other "NO" CVE commits in the examples, which are all API modernization changes replacing deprecated property functions with their correct counterparts. The change only affects which kernel API function is used for the same property check - there's no change in logic, validation, or security handling.
486055f5e09df RDMA/core: Fix best page size finding when it can cross SG entries
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The fix addresses a performance optimization issue, not a security vulnerability. The core issue was that `ib_umem_find_best_pgsz()` incorrectly selected 4KB page sizes instead of larger optimal sizes when handling physically contiguous GPU memory split across multiple scatter-gather entries due to 32-bit length field limitations. This resulted in suboptimal performance but did not create any exploitable security conditions. Key reasons this is not a CVE: 1. **No memory safety issues** - The fix doesn't address buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption 2. **No privilege escalation potential** - Access controls and security boundaries remain unchanged 3. **Performance optimization only** - This improves efficiency of page size selection without fixing security bugs 4. **No exploitable attack vectors** - Unlike the similar infinite loop overflow case that got a CVE, this has no DoS or attack potential The changes in `drivers/infiniband/core/umem.c` and `drivers/infiniband/core/verbs.c` improve algorithmic correctness for handling cross-SG-entry memory analysis, which is a computational efficiency improvement rather than a security fix. This aligns with the historical pattern where similar RDMA performance optimizations have not received CVE assignments.
cbf4890c6f28f drm/amd/display: Don't treat wb connector as physical in create_validate_stream_for_sink
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. The fix addresses a type confusion vulnerability where writeback connectors (of type `drm_wb_connector`) were being incorrectly cast and treated as `amdgpu_dm_connector` objects. **Security Analysis:** 1. **Type Confusion Vulnerability**: The original code assumed all connectors passed to `create_validate_stream_for_sink()` were `amdgpu_dm_connector` objects, but writeback connectors are actually `drm_wb_connector` objects with a different memory layout. 2. **Memory Safety Issue**: The commit message explicitly states "While dereferencing aconnector->base will 'work' it's wrong and might lead to unknown bad things." This indicates potential memory corruption when accessing fields at incorrect offsets. 3. **Code Pattern**: This fix follows the same security pattern as similar commits (refs 7db7ade270ae and ecedd99a9369) that were marked with CVE status YES - they all address the same fundamental type confusion issue between writeback and regular connectors. 4. **Critical System Component**: The vulnerability affects GPU driver display management, a privileged kernel component that handles hardware resources. 5. **Fix Validation**: The fix properly: - Changes function signature to accept generic `drm_connector*` - Adds explicit check for `DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_WRITEBACK` - Only casts to `amdgpu_dm_connector` for non-writeback connectors - Returns early for writeback connectors to avoid unsafe operations The type confusion could potentially lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, or system instability when writeback connectors are processed through code paths expecting different object layouts.
1bd2aad57da95 serial: mctrl_gpio: split disable_ms into sync and no_sync APIs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit details and the kernel source code context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Primary Issue Analysis:** The commit fixes a "sleeping function called from invalid context" bug where `disable_irq()` (which can sleep) was being called while holding a spinlock in serial drivers. The fix splits `mctrl_gpio_disable_ms()` into sync and no-sync variants to use `disable_irq_nosync()` in atomic contexts. **Why this doesn't warrant a CVE:** 1. **No Security Impact**: This is purely a system reliability/stability issue with no direct security implications: - No memory corruption potential - No privilege escalation pathway - No information disclosure - No authentication/authorization bypass 2. **Local Impact Only**: The bug only affects local system stability when specific serial driver operations occur while holding port locks. 3. **Warning vs Vulnerability**: The atomic sleep violation triggers kernel warnings but doesn't create exploitable conditions - it's a debugging/quality issue rather than a security flaw. 4. **Limited Scope**: While serial drivers are important for system operation, this specific locking issue doesn't compromise the security boundary of the serial subsystem. **Key Code Evidence:** The fix simply changes from `disable_irq()` to `disable_irq_nosync()` in atomic contexts (like `drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_port.c:1683` and `drivers/tty/serial/atmel_serial.c:703`), and uses the sync version where safe. This is a straightforward API usage correction, not a security vulnerability fix. **Comparison to Similar CVE Commits:** Unlike the provided examples which fixed actual security issues (race conditions, memory allocation in atomic context with system impact), this commit only addresses a kernel debugging warning without security consequences.
72d7a7fa1f240 drm/amd/display: Guard against setting dispclk low when active
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with the reference commits, this should **not** be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **Type of Issue**: This is a **stability and timing fix** rather than a security vulnerability. The commit adds guards to prevent setting dispclk (display clock) to unsafe values when displays are active, which is defensive programming against hardware timing issues. 2. **Comparison with Reference Commits**: All similar commits in the reference set are marked "CVE Status: NO", and they involve similar AMD display driver optimizations and stability fixes. Like those commits, this addresses a hardware timing/configuration issue rather than a security flaw. 3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The fix prevents: - Display system crashes due to clock underflow - Race conditions in clock management - System hangs during display transitions However, these are **availability/stability issues**, not security vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption. 4. **Root Cause Analysis**: The code change adds logic to defer dispclk optimization until `safe_to_lower = true` and `display_count == 0`. This is a **hardware timing constraint** rather than a security boundary - it prevents the hardware from being put into an invalid state that could cause hangs or crashes. 5. **Impact Assessment**: While system crashes can affect availability, this fix addresses normal hardware operation constraints rather than exploitable security flaws. The issue would manifest as system instability rather than security compromise. The commit represents good defensive programming practices for critical hardware management, but does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
6571bef25fe48 drm/amd/display: Add support for disconnected eDP streams
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes more carefully. Looking at the diff: The change moves the `SIGNAL_TYPE_VIRTUAL` check before the `SIGNAL_TYPE_EDP` check in the `link_decide_link_settings` function. This is a simple reordering of conditional statements. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of Change**: This is a logic reordering that moves the virtual signal type check before the eDP connector signal check. 2. **Security Impact Assessment**: - The change affects the order of signal type evaluation - No memory operations, bounds checking, or access controls are modified - No input validation changes - No privilege escalation potential - No buffer operations or pointer arithmetic 3. **Functional Impact**: - The commit message indicates this fixes enumeration failures when eDP is not connected at driver start - This appears to be a driver initialization robustness improvement - The change ensures virtual signals are handled before attempting eDP-specific logic 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar to Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, and 5 which were marked "CVE Status: NO" - These were functional fixes without security implications - Unlike Similar Commit 3 which had a null pointer dereference fix (marked "CVE Status: YES") 5. **Security Vulnerability Indicators**: None present - No crash potential - No memory safety issues - No access control bypass - No input validation weaknesses **NO** This commit reorders conditional logic to fix eDP enumeration failures when the display is not connected at driver startup. It's a functional robustness improvement that moves virtual signal handling before eDP signal handling, with no security implications. The change is similar to other display driver fixes that were correctly classified as not requiring CVEs.
de84d580126eb drm/amd/display: Read LTTPR ALPM caps during link cap retrieval
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, this should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. ## Analysis: **1. Nature of Changes:** - Extends a buffer from 8 to 10 bytes: `uint8_t lttpr_dpcd_data[10] = {0};` - Adds reading of new ALMP capabilities at DPCD register 0xF0009 - Adds new data structure fields to store the additional capabilities **2. Commit Message Context:** - Explicitly states this implements "latest DP spec" requirements - Describes reading "DPCD F0000h through F0009h when detecting LTTPR capabilities for the first time" - Framed as updating to read "two more bytes than the previous F0007h" **3. Security Assessment:** - This appears to be a **proactive feature addition** for DisplayPort 2.1 specification compliance - The buffer expansion from 8→10 bytes is **intentional and controlled** to accommodate the new spec requirements - No indication of fixing an existing vulnerability - the commit message focuses on implementing new spec requirements - The array access `lttpr_dpcd_data[DP_LTTPR_ALMP_CAPABILITIES - DP_LT_TUNABLE_PHY_REPEATER_FIELD_DATA_STRUCTURE_REV]` evaluates to a valid index within the new 10-byte buffer **4. Pattern Matching:** This closely matches Similar Commits 1 and 2 (both CVE Status: NO), which also implemented DP specification updates for LTTPR functionality without security implications. **Conclusion:** This is a routine specification compliance update, not a security vulnerability fix.
94030a1d32832 drm/xe/client: Skip show_run_ticks if unable to read timestamp
- [sasha] Based on my analysis: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit addresses an access control issue in VF (Virtual Function) mode where RING_TIMESTAMP registers are inaccessible. The fix simply skips showing optional timing statistics rather than fixing a vulnerability. 2. **Graceful Degradation**: The change adds a check `if (IS_SRIOV_VF(xe)) return;` to exit early when running in VF mode, preventing attempts to access inaccessible registers. This is a functional improvement, not a security fix. 3. **No Privilege/Access Control Issues**: The commit doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access. It prevents a functional problem (attempting to read inaccessible registers) by gracefully skipping the operation. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this is most similar to "Similar Commit 3" and "Similar Commit 5" which are infrastructure/functional fixes marked as "CVE Status: NO". It's not like "Similar Commit 2" which fixed UAF and NPD issues (marked "CVE Status: YES"). 5. **Limited Impact**: The worst-case scenario would be a failed register read or system hang, but this is contained to the VF mode context and doesn't expose security vulnerabilities. This is a robustness/compatibility fix for SR-IOV VF environments, not a security vulnerability.
b2a9e562dfa15 drm/amd/pm: Fetch current power limit from PMFW
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit adds one line to enable querying the firmware for current power limits on SMU v13.0.12, similar to behavior already implemented for other SMU versions (13.0.2, 13.0.6, 13.0.14, and various 11.0.x versions). **Analysis:** 1. **Code Change Analysis**: The commit adds `case IP_VERSION(13, 0, 12):` to an existing switch statement that determines when to query firmware for current power limits via `smu_get_asic_power_limits()`. 2. **Security Implications**: This is not a security fix but rather a feature enhancement/bug fix. The commit: - Does not fix any security vulnerability - Does not address buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - Does not fix race conditions or privilege escalation - Simply extends existing functionality to another hardware version 3. **Pattern Comparison**: Looking at similar commits in the historical data, commits that add hardware version support or query firmware for configuration values are consistently marked as non-CVE worthy (like the similar commits provided as examples). 4. **Commit Context**: The commit message indicates this is to ensure power limits are properly queried from firmware when they "could be updated through other means," suggesting this is about data consistency rather than security. 5. **Function Behavior**: The `smu_get_asic_power_limits` function is already being called for other hardware versions in the same code path, so this extends tested, existing functionality rather than introducing new attack surfaces. This is a routine hardware support enhancement that follows existing patterns and does not introduce or fix security vulnerabilities.
07bc2dcbcf403 drm/amd/display: Fix BT2020 YCbCr limited/full range input
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis of the code changes and context from the Linux kernel tree, this is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. **Key evidence:** 1. **Functional Issue Only**: The commit fixes missing support for BT2020 YCbCr limited range color space. Before the fix, the code would return `-EINVAL` for limited range inputs, and after the fix it properly handles both limited and full range. 2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes involve adding new enum values (`COLOR_SPACE_2020_YCBCR_LIMITED`, `COLOR_SPACE_2020_YCBCR_FULL`) and corresponding CSC matrices. The array lookups for color space matrices have proper bounds checking with safe error handling (`BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER()` calls). 3. **Safe Error Handling**: The original code cleanly returned error codes rather than causing undefined behavior or memory corruption. 4. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: This affects display color space handling for graphics output - there's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption vector. 5. **Pattern Analysis**: Comparing to the similar commits provided, this matches the "NO CVE" pattern - it's a display driver functional improvement similar to the other display-related commits that were not assigned CVEs. The commit enhances HDR display compatibility by properly supporting BT2020 color spaces, but poses no security risk.

a892ee4cf22a5 i3c: master: svc: Flush FIFO before sending Dynamic Address Assignment(DAA)
- [sasha] Based on my security analysis of this commit and examination of the Linux kernel source code, I can provide a comprehensive assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Hardware Correctness, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit addresses a hardware operational issue where stale FIFO data could interfere with the Dynamic Address Assignment (DAA) process. While this could theoretically cause device misidentification or address assignment errors, it represents a hardware state management bug rather than an exploitable security vulnerability. 2. **Limited Attack Surface**: The DAA process occurs during system initialization when I3C devices are being discovered and configured. An attacker would need physical access to the I3C bus and the ability to control previous transactions to potentially exploit this issue, making practical attacks extremely difficult. 3. **No Direct Security Impact**: The commit message and code changes show this is primarily about ensuring consistent operation and preventing incorrect command data from being sent. The fix aligns the DAA process with other data transfers that already flush the FIFO, indicating this is a consistency/correctness improvement. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The provided reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") address similar hardware state management and operational correctness issues in I3C drivers without being assigned CVEs, establishing precedent that such fixes are maintenance rather than security-critical. 5. **Robustness Fix, Not Vulnerability**: The change adds `svc_i3c_master_flush_fifo(master);` before DAA to ensure clean FIFO state, which is a defensive programming practice to prevent potential hardware state issues rather than fixing an actively exploitable vulnerability. While proper FIFO management is important for system reliability and could theoretically prevent some edge-case scenarios where device addressing might go wrong, this represents a hardware driver robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
c29dfd661fe2f EDAC/ie31200: work around false positive build warning
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit addresses a false positive compiler warning in gcc-14 and does not fix any actual security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **No Security Issue Fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is a "bogus warning" and "false positive build warning" from gcc-14. The author clearly states "I don't see any way the uninitialized access could really happen here." 2. **Code Refactoring Only**: The changes are purely a refactoring to avoid the compiler warning: - Removes the 2D array `dimm_info[IE31200_CHANNELS][IE31200_DIMMS_PER_CHANNEL]` - Changes `u32 addr_decode` to `u32 addr_decode[IE31200_CHANNELS]` array - Moves the `struct dimm_data dimm_info` declaration inside the inner loop as a single instance - Functionally equivalent behavior - same data is read and processed 3. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as "Similar Commit 5" which was marked CVE Status: NO - it's a gcc false-positive warning workaround in `/drivers/base/regmap/regcache-maple.c` that initialized variables to work around `-Wuninitialized` warnings. 4. **No Memory Safety Impact**: The refactoring doesn't fix any buffer overflow, use-after-free, uninitialized memory access, or other security-relevant bugs. It's purely restructuring the code to avoid confusing the compiler's static analysis. The commit is a code quality improvement to enable compilation with `-Werror` on gcc-14, not a security fix.
bbcfe510ecd47 power: supply: axp20x_battery: Update temp sensor for AXP717 from device tree
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Purpose**: The commit adds a device tree property `x-powers,no-thermistor` to disable temperature sensor functionality on AXP717 PMIC devices where the ts pin is not connected. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - Adds a new boolean field `ts_disable` to the `axp20x_batt_ps` structure - Reads the device tree property `x-powers,no-thermistor` - If the property is present, sets the `AXP717_TS_PIN_DISABLE` bit in the `AXP717_TS_PIN_CFG` register 3. **Not a security fix**: - This is a hardware configuration workaround for devices with incorrectly programmed efuses or unconnected temperature sensor pins - It's adding new functionality rather than fixing a vulnerability - The commit message mentions "fault conditions" but these appear to be hardware/operational faults, not security vulnerabilities - No mention of privilege escalation, memory corruption, access control bypass, or other security issues 4. **Similar pattern**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all received "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar power supply driver functionality improvements rather than security fixes. This commit adds a configuration option to work around hardware issues - it's an enhancement, not a security fix.
d9406677428e9 eeprom: ee1004: Check chip before probing
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a robustness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix that warrants a CVE. The analysis shows: 1. **No immediate security threat**: The missing device validation could cause resource allocation for non-existent devices and potentially confusing system state, but does not create exploitable vulnerabilities. 2. **Standard hardening**: The fix follows common defensive programming practices already used by other EEPROM drivers (like at24) to validate device presence before initialization. 3. **Minor impact**: While the absence of validation could lead to resource waste and false device registration, it doesn't provide attack vectors for privilege escalation or memory corruption. 4. **Similar commits reference**: Looking at the provided examples, this mirrors "Similar Commit 3" which also added device validation but was marked as "CVE Status: NO". The key change (`err = i2c_smbus_read_byte(client); if (err < 0) return -ENODEV;`) simply ensures the I2C device exists before proceeding with driver initialization, preventing resource allocation for non-existent hardware. This is standard kernel hardening rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
0f67911e821c6 irqchip/riscv-imsic: Separate next and previous pointers in IMSIC vector
- [sasha] Now let me examine the actual code changes in detail to understand the security implications: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: ## Key Reasons: 1. **Structural Improvement, Not Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is "To support forced cleanup" - it's adding new functionality to separate next/previous pointers rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. 2. **No Direct Exploitation Vector**: The changes affect interrupt vector management which: - Requires kernel-level privileges to manipulate - Is architecture-specific (RISC-V only) - Has no direct userspace attack surface 3. **Comparison to Similar CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES": - Those explicitly mentioned "vector leak during CPU offline" as a bug being fixed - Those had clear security implications with resource leakage - This commit is proactive structural improvement, not reactive bug fixing 4. **Code Changes Analysis**: - The changes add `move_next` and `move_prev` pointers to replace a single `move` pointer - New synchronization logic in `__imsic_local_sync()` that checks completion order - Addition of timer-based cleanup mechanism (`__imsic_local_timer_start()`) - These are robustness improvements, not vulnerability patches 5. **No Security Context in Commit Message**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commits which mentioned specific problems being fixed, this commit focuses on architectural improvement and doesn't reference any security issues, race conditions, or resource leaks being resolved. The commit improves code maintainability and adds support for forced cleanup scenarios, but does not fix an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
425e64440ad0a net: pktgen: fix access outside of user given buffer in pktgen_thread_write()
- [sasha] **YES** This commit fixes a buffer overread vulnerability that allows reading memory outside the bounds of the user-provided buffer. Here's the analysis: **Security Impact:** - The `strn_len()` function was being called with hardcoded maximum lengths (`sizeof(name) - 1` and `sizeof(f) - 1`) without considering the remaining bytes in the user buffer - This could cause the kernel to read past the end of the user-provided buffer, potentially exposing kernel memory contents **Code Changes Analysis:** The fix properly bounds-checks by using `min(sizeof(name) - 1, count - i)` and `min(sizeof(f) - 1, count - i)` to ensure `strn_len()` never reads beyond the user buffer boundaries. **CVE Justification:** 1. **Memory disclosure vulnerability**: Reading past buffer boundaries can leak kernel memory 2. **Affects privileged interface**: pktgen is a kernel network testing tool accessed via procfs 3. **Similar pattern to known CVEs**: This follows the same vulnerability pattern as the other pktgen commits that received CVEs (buffer boundary violations) 4. **Clear security fix**: The commit message explicitly mentions fixing "access outside of user given buffer" This is a classic buffer overread vulnerability in kernel code that processes user input, warranting CVE assignment for proper tracking and patching.
f11d042b3a2e9 wifi: rtw89: fw: add blacklist to avoid obsolete secure firmware
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific code changes in this commit: **Key Analysis Points:** 1. **Commit Purpose**: The commit adds a blacklist mechanism to prevent loading of obsolete secure firmware that contains known weaknesses or flaws. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Adds `rtw89_fw_blacklist` structure with version and list fields - Implements `__check_secure_blacklist()` function that validates firmware against a chip-specific blacklist - Returns `-EPERM` when blacklisted firmware is detected - Only applies to secure boot enabled systems (`sec->secure_boot`) 3. **Security Implications**: - **Prevents loading of vulnerable firmware**: The blacklist mechanism specifically targets firmware with "weakness or flaw was found" - **Secure boot context**: Only affects systems with secure boot enabled, indicating this is for hardware with security requirements - **Mandatory enforcement**: Returns `-EPERM` (permission denied) which will prevent system operation with blacklisted firmware 4. **Error Handling**: ```c if (chip_blacklist->list[byte_idx] & bit_mask) { rtw89_err(rtwdev, "firmware %u in chip blacklist\n", section_content->blacklist.ver); return -EPERM; } ``` 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved minor fixes like format strings, retry logic, or configuration updates - none addressed security vulnerabilities. **Decision:** **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. While it implements important security hardening by preventing the use of vulnerable firmware, it is a **proactive security measure** rather than a fix for an exploitable vulnerability. The commit: 1. **Prevents future exploitation** of known firmware vulnerabilities rather than fixing a current kernel vulnerability 2. **Only affects secure boot systems** - limiting scope to specific hardware configurations 3. **Implements access control** rather than fixing memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other direct kernel vulnerabilities 4. **Functions as intended security hardening** similar to other blacklist mechanisms in the kernel The blacklist mechanism is a security enhancement that prevents loading of firmware with known issues, but the vulnerability being addressed exists in the firmware itself, not in the kernel driver code. This is analogous to other kernel hardening features that don't receive CVEs despite improving security posture.
56e1acaa0f806 wifi: rtw89: fw: propagate error code from rtw89_h2c_tx()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit changes. The commit removes hardcoded error assignments and properly propagates error codes from `rtw89_h2c_tx()`. Looking at the changes: 1. **Before**: When `rtw89_h2c_tx()` failed, the code was setting `ret = -1` instead of using the actual error code 2. **After**: The actual error code from `rtw89_h2c_tx()` is now propagated to callers The commit message states: "The error code should be propagated to callers during downloading firmware header and body. Remove unnecessary assignment of -1." This is clearly a code quality improvement, not a security vulnerability fix. The changes: 1. Remove unnecessary `ret = -1` assignments 2. Allow proper error code propagation from the H2C (Host-to-Chip) communication function 3. Improve error handling by providing more specific error information Comparing this to the similar commits provided: - Similar commits 1-5 all have "CVE Status: NO" - Those commits involve format fixes, firmware loading improvements, header conversion rules, retry mechanisms, and type casting fixes - None of them address security vulnerabilities This commit is similar in nature - it's an error handling improvement that makes debugging easier by providing proper error codes instead of generic -1 values. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability like buffer overflows, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or input validation issues. **NO** This commit improves error handling by properly propagating error codes from `rtw89_h2c_tx()` instead of using hardcoded `-1` values. It's a code quality improvement for better debugging, not a security vulnerability fix. The changes only affect error reporting mechanisms without addressing any security weaknesses like buffer overflows, memory corruption, or input validation issues.
e66bca16638ee wifi: rtw88: Fix rtw_mac_power_switch() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the code change and understand its security implications: **Analysis of the Commit:** **NO** This commit is a hardware-specific bug fix that does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds a single chip-specific condition (`chip->id != RTW_CHIP_TYPE_8814A`) to modify power state detection logic for the RTL8814AU chip. 2. **Technical details**: The change addresses a hardware quirk where bit 8 of REG_SYS_STATUS1 is always on in RTL8814AU, making the existing power state detection unreliable. The fix excludes RTL8814AU from this specific check. 3. **Security impact assessment**: - **No privilege escalation**: This doesn't affect access controls or permissions - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory corruption - **No input validation bypass**: Not related to input handling - **No race conditions**: This is a synchronous hardware register check - **No information disclosure**: Doesn't expose sensitive information 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, all marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar hardware-specific fixes or driver improvements without security implications. This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **Functional impact**: The fix resolves incorrect power state detection that could lead to device malfunction, but this is a reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit is a straightforward hardware compatibility fix that improves device functionality without addressing any security concerns.
86d04f8f991a0 wifi: rtw88: Fix rtw_desc_to_mcsrate() to handle MCS16-31
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the current commit about fixing `rtw_desc_to_mcsrate()`: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Code Analysis:** The change extends the MCS rate range check from `DESC_RATEMCS15` to `DESC_RATEMCS31` and adds `*nss = 0` initialization for HT rates. This is a **functionality fix**, not a security vulnerability. **Key Points:** 1. **Missing Functionality**: The original code ignored MCS16-31 (3SS and 4SS HT rates), causing the function to not properly translate these rates for mac80211. 2. **No Buffer Overflow**: The change extends a range check (`rate <= DESC_RATEMCS31`) rather than removing bounds checking. The calculation `*mcs = rate - DESC_RATEMCS0` is safe because: - It only executes when `rate` is within the validated range - The result is simply stored in an output parameter - No buffer access or memory allocation is involved 3. **Initialization Fix**: Adding `*nss = 0` is defensive programming to ensure the output parameter is initialized for HT rates. **Comparison to Similar Commits:** Like the provided examples (all marked CVE Status: NO), this is a functionality fix that: - Corrects rate translation logic - Improves wireless performance/compatibility - Does not address security vulnerabilities - Has no potential for memory corruption or privilege escalation **Impact:** This fix improves wireless performance by properly handling higher MCS rates but has no security implications. It's a standard functionality improvement in wireless driver code.
c7eea1ba05ca5 wifi: rtw88: Fix rtw_init_ht_cap() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] ## Analysis **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes an incorrect capability advertisement in the HT (High Throughput) capability structure for the RTL8814AU WiFi chip. The original code hardcoded support for only 1 or 2 spatial streams, while RTL8814AU actually supports 3 spatial streams. 2. **Impact Analysis**: - **Before fix**: Device advertises incorrect RX capabilities (only 2 spatial streams instead of 3) - **After fix**: Device correctly advertises 3 spatial streams support - **Security implications**: None - this is purely a performance/functionality fix 3. **Code Changes Examined**: - Original code: Hardcoded `rx_mask[0]` and `rx_mask[1]` only, with fixed rates of 150 Mbps (1SS) or 300 Mbps (2SS) - Fixed code: Dynamically sets `rx_mask[i]` for all available spatial streams (`efuse->hw_cap.nss`) and calculates rate as `150 amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md bpf_clean_live_states_loop_branches_security_analysis.md bpf_copy_verifier_state_loop_entry_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md i3c_svc_fifo_flush_daa_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md io_uring_sanitise_params_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rdma_core_page_size_finding_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md nss` 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (CVE Status: NO) are also performance/correctness fixes for WiFi rate calculations and bandwidth reporting, none involving security vulnerabilities. 5. **No Security Components Affected**: This change only affects WiFi capability advertisement to optimize performance - it doesn't involve memory management, access control, input validation, race conditions, or privilege escalation. The fix ensures RTL8814AU devices properly advertise their 3-spatial-stream capability instead of being limited to 2 streams, improving network performance but introducing no security implications.
2f9da853f4d84 wifi: rtw89: fw: get sb_sel_ver via get_unaligned_le32()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Limited Security Impact**: The issue only causes crashes (availability impact) on architectures that enforce strict memory alignment (like ARM), not memory corruption or exploitable conditions. On x86, it just causes performance penalties. 2. **High Attack Prerequisites**: Exploiting this would require: - Ability to modify firmware files - Local system access - Alignment-sensitive architecture - Usually root privileges for firmware loading 3. **Robustness Fix Pattern**: This follows the pattern of alignment fixes that are typically classified as compatibility/robustness improvements rather than security vulnerabilities. The similar commits in the reference examples (rtw89 format fixes, timing corrections) all received "CVE Status: NO" for similar reasons. 4. **Nature of the Fix**: The change from `le32_to_cpu()` to `get_unaligned_le32()` is a standard kernel practice for handling potentially unaligned data safely. This is preventive engineering rather than fixing an actively exploited vulnerability. 5. **Context**: This is firmware parsing code that processes trusted firmware binaries. While malformed firmware could trigger the alignment issue, this represents a narrow attack vector with limited impact compared to typical wireless driver vulnerabilities. The commit represents good defensive programming to prevent potential crashes on certain architectures, but lacks the exploitability and impact characteristics that warrant CVE assignment.
bdce0574243b4 wifi: rtw89: 8922a: fix incorrect STA-ID in EHT MU PPDU
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Code Change Analysis The commit adds a single field (`vif->cfg.aid`) to be encoded into the `CCTLINFO_G7_W6_AID12_PAID` field in the firmware command structure. This is: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix** - It's a correctness fix for WiFi 7 (EHT) protocol compliance 2. **Adding missing data, not fixing a bounds issue** - The AID (Association ID) field was missing from the firmware command 3. **Protocol compliance fix** - Ensures STA-ID in EHT MU PPDU matches the AID from Association Response ## Security Impact Assessment - **No memory safety issues**: This is just adding a 12-bit field to an existing data structure - **No access control bypass**: The AID is legitimate association data - **No information disclosure**: The AID is already known to both endpoints - **No authentication/encryption impact**: This affects MAC layer signaling, not security protocols ## Technical Context From the similar commits analysis, this appears to be part of ongoing development and correctness improvements for the RTW89 8922a WiFi 7 chipset driver, not security hardening. The change ensures the hardware correctly identifies stations in multi-user transmissions, which is a performance and reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. The missing AID field could potentially cause: - Incorrect station identification in MU-MIMO scenarios - Performance degradation - Protocol non-compliance But none of these constitute security vulnerabilities that would warrant CVE assignment.
4f13dd9e2b1d2 PCI: epf-mhi: Update device ID for SA8775P
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is simply updating a device ID from a temporary placeholder value to the correct, finalized value for the SA8775P SoC. The analysis shows: 1. **Non-security nature**: The change only updates the `deviceid` field from `0x0306` to `0x0116` in the PCI endpoint function header for SA8775P. This is purely an identification change. 2. **Historical context**: The git history reveals that `0x0306` was a temporary placeholder with an explicit "FIXME" comment indicating it needed to be updated once the proper device ID was allocated. The original commit (c670e29f5bfe) even stated "SA8775P is currently reusing the PID 0x0306 (the default one hardcoded in the config space header) as the unique PID is not yet allocated." 3. **No security implications**: This is similar to the provided similar commits that just add or update PCI device IDs - it affects device identification and driver binding but has no security ramifications. 4. **Administrative correction**: This is fixing an incorrect placeholder value to use the proper allocated device ID, which is standard maintenance for PCI device drivers. The commit follows the same pattern as the "NO CVE" similar commits that merely update device identification without any security-relevant code changes.
6be7544d19fcf wifi: rtw88: Fix rtw_init_vht_cap() for RTL8814AU
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The code changes correct VHT capability initialization for RTL8814AU by: 1. **Replacing hardcoded values with dynamic calculation**: The original code hardcoded MCS maps and rates for 1-2 spatial streams, while the fix properly calculates these based on `efuse->hw_cap.nss` (which is 3 for RTL8814AU). 2. **Fixing capability reporting**: The changes ensure the device correctly reports its actual capabilities (3 spatial streams) rather than incorrect hardcoded values. The security implications are minimal because: - The `efuse->hw_cap.nss` value is validated and bounded by hardware constraints - The fix improves protocol correctness rather than addressing an exploitable vulnerability - No memory safety issues, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation risks are involved - The original incorrect capability reporting would mainly cause performance/interoperability issues, not security vulnerabilities This aligns with the similar commits in the reference examples, which are all functional fixes (bandwidth calculation, register bit corrections, timing parameters) rather than security fixes, and all have "CVE Status: NO".
3128b0a2e0cf6 clocksource: mips-gic-timer: Enable counter when CPUs start
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and similar commits, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional issue where GIC timers in secondary clusters of multi-cluster MIPS I6500 systems are not started properly, causing clock event devices to break. This is a system functionality problem, not a security issue. 2. **No security implications**: The code changes show: - Moving `clear_gic_config(GIC_CONFIG_COUNTSTOP)` from initialization to the per-CPU startup callback at `/drivers/clocksource/mips-gic-timer.c:119` - This ensures each cluster's counter starts when CPUs come online - No access control, privilege escalation, memory safety, or input validation concerns 3. **Similar patterns in reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (commits 3 and 5), they also deal with timer/clock functionality improvements without security impact, similar to this commit. 4. **Nature of the fix**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes "broken GIC clock_event_device" functionality in multi-cluster systems - this is clearly a correctness/reliability fix rather than a security fix. 5. **No sensitive operations affected**: The change only affects timer counter initialization timing, which doesn't involve sensitive kernel operations like memory management, access control, or privilege boundaries. The commit improves system reliability by ensuring timer counters work correctly in multi-cluster configurations, but does not address any security vulnerability.
ac9c5170a1816 pps: generators: replace copy of pps-gen info struct with const pointer
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications carefully: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Key Changes Analysis:** 1. **Structure Modification**: Changed `struct pps_gen_device` to store a `const struct pps_gen_source_info *info` pointer instead of copying the entire structure (`struct pps_gen_source_info info`) 2. **Access Pattern Change**: All accesses to info fields changed from `pps_gen->info.field` to `pps_gen->info->field` 3. **Registration Change**: `pps_gen_register_source()` now takes a const pointer and stores it directly rather than copying the struct **Security Assessment:** **This is NOT a security vulnerability because:** 1. **No Memory Management Issue**: The change doesn't introduce buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory corruption. The lifetime management remains the same - the caller must ensure the info struct remains valid during the device's lifetime. 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: This change doesn't affect access controls or privilege boundaries. The PPS generator framework maintains the same security posture. 3. **No Input Validation Issue**: The change doesn't affect how user input is validated or processed. The same ioctl handlers and sysfs interfaces are used. 4. **Design Improvement, Not Bug Fix**: This is clearly an API design improvement to allow drivers to use `container_of()` to retrieve their private data structures. The commit message explicitly states this is to solve a design limitation, not a security issue. 5. **Const Correctness**: The addition of `const` actually improves safety by preventing modification of the info structure through the framework. 6. **No Race Conditions**: The change doesn't introduce or fix any race conditions or synchronization issues. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits:** - Similar Commit 1 & 4: Added NULL pointer checks to prevent crashes - these are defensive programming fixes for potential NULL dereferences - Similar Commit 5: Fixed a race condition with pointer dereferencing that could cause crashes - This commit: API design improvement with no security implications This is a straightforward refactoring to improve the driver API design and enable better driver implementation patterns. It carries no security implications and should not receive a CVE assignment.
1f7df3a691740 genirq/msi: Store the IOMMU IOVA directly in msi_desc instead of iommu_cookie
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **YES** This commit fixes a clear Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability in the IOMMU MSI translation path. Here's why this merits a CVE: 1. **Security Impact**: The commit explicitly identifies and fixes UAF vulnerabilities that can be exploited by userspace through VFIO operations. 2. **Race Condition Exploit**: The vulnerability allows userspace to race `VFIO_DEVICE_ATTACH_IOMMUFD_PT` (which calls `iommu_attach_group()`) against `VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS` (which calls `iommu_dma_compose_msi_msg()`), creating a direct userspace-triggerable race condition. 3. **Multiple UAF Points**: - The `iommu_cookie` pointer stored in `msi_desc` could be freed while still being accessed - The unlocked call to `iommu_get_domain_for_dev()` in `iommu_dma_compose_msi_msg()` could access freed domain structures 4. **Memory Safety Issue**: UAF vulnerabilities are classic memory safety issues that can lead to information disclosure, memory corruption, or potentially code execution if exploited properly. 5. **Lifetime Management Problem**: The old code had an inherent lifetime management problem where a pointer must remain valid between two operations separated in time without proper locking protection. The fix fundamentally changes the approach by storing the IOVA address as an integer value rather than keeping a pointer to potentially freed memory, eliminating the UAF condition. This is a genuine security improvement that addresses a race condition exploitable from userspace.
5612d6d51ed26 scsi: mpt3sas: Send a diag reset if target reset fails
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it improves error handling and system robustness, it is not fixing a security vulnerability that meets CVE criteria. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds proper error checking for task management operations. When a target reset fails, it now escalates to a diagnostic reset rather than leaving the controller potentially unrecoverable. 2. **Security context**: This is a robustness/reliability improvement rather than a security fix. The code changes show: - Adding `tm_ret` variable to capture return value - Checking if `tm_ret != SUCCESS` - Issuing hard reset as escalation if target reset fails 3. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits that received CVEs: - Those fixed use-after-free bugs, page faults, and memory corruption issues - This commit fixes error handling/recovery procedures without addressing memory safety or access control issues 4. **Impact assessment**: While failure to recover from timeouts could theoretically cause denial of service, this appears to be improving existing error recovery rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. The change ensures better recovery from already-handled timeout conditions. 5. **Code pattern**: This follows a common pattern of improving error handling robustness rather than fixing a security flaw that could be exploited by an attacker.
756276ce78d56 MIPS: Use arch specific syscall name match function
- [sasha] NO This commit is not a security fix and should not be assigned a CVE. The code changes are purely functional improvements for ftrace syscall tracing on MIPS architecture: 1. **Purpose**: The commit adds an architecture-specific function `arch_syscall_match_sym_name()` to properly match syscall function names during ftrace operations on MIPS systems. 2. **Functionality**: The function handles the MIPS-specific naming convention where some syscalls (like fork/clone) use `__sys_` prefix instead of the standard `sys_` prefix. It provides correct string matching between symbol names in the syscall table and ftrace metadata. 3. **No security implications**: - No memory safety issues are being fixed - No access control changes - No privilege escalation fixes - No input validation improvements - No buffer overflow or race condition fixes 4. **Pattern analysis**: This follows the same pattern as similar architecture-specific implementations in other architectures (x86, ARM64, PowerPC, etc.) that define their own `arch_syscall_match_sym_name()` functions for proper syscall name matching in ftrace. The commit is a debugging/tracing infrastructure improvement to ensure ftrace correctly identifies MIPS syscalls, not a security vulnerability fix.
98c9d27ab30aa drm/xe/oa: Ensure that polled read returns latest data
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change only adds a call to `xe_oa_buffer_check_unlocked()` in the non-blocking read path, which updates internal buffer state management. This function: - Updates buffer tail pointers to reflect hardware state - Sets the `pollin` flag to indicate data availability - Does NOT expose any additional sensitive data to userspace - Uses proper spinlock protection 2. **Existing Access Controls Remain**: The commit doesn't bypass any existing security mechanisms: - CAP_PERFMON capability is still required for privileged OA operations - Paranoid mode protection remains in place - Exclusive access controls per OA unit are unchanged 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The change doesn't allow unauthorized access to data or escalate privileges. It only improves timing consistency between blocking and non-blocking read paths. 4. **Performance Data Only**: OA buffers contain GPU performance counters and timestamps, not sensitive system or user data that would warrant CVE-level security concerns. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This change is consistent with the pattern seen in the provided reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") which make similar internal improvements to the OA subsystem without introducing security vulnerabilities. The commit appears to be a legitimate functional improvement that ensures polled reads get the most current buffer state, similar to how blocking reads already work through the timer callback mechanism.
a37259732a7dc x86/mm: Make MMU_GATHER_RCU_TABLE_FREE unconditional
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and detailed examination of the kernel codebase, my assessment is: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Proactive improvement, not vulnerability fix**: The detailed analysis reveals this is a "proactive security improvement" that unifies page table freeing mechanisms rather than fixing a specific reported vulnerability. The commit message language ("There is no real good reason to do things differently", "Make them all the same") indicates architectural improvement rather than bug fixing. 2. **No existing exploit or CVE found**: The kernel tree analysis found "no specific CVEs directly related to this change" and no evidence of actual exploitable conditions in the wild. 3. **Primary purpose is feature enablement**: The commit's main goal is to "make it safe to use INVLPGB on AMD CPUs" - enabling new hardware functionality rather than fixing security flaws. 4. **Eliminates "potential" not actual vulnerabilities**: While the analysis mentions the commit eliminates race conditions that "could lead to" use-after-free vulnerabilities, the language consistently refers to "potential" threats rather than confirmed exploitable conditions. 5. **Consistent with similar non-CVE commits**: This resembles Similar Commit 1 and 4 (both NO CVE) which were also architectural improvements/unifications rather than security fixes. The key distinction is that commits warranting CVEs typically fix specific, exploitable vulnerabilities (like Similar Commits 2, 3, 5 which fixed actual TLB flush timing issues), whereas this commit proactively strengthens the architecture by unifying synchronization mechanisms across different x86 configurations.
db014522f3560 net: ipv6: Init tunnel link-netns before registering dev
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context in the broader series of commits, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This commit is part of a larger series focused on improving **network namespace handling consistency** for IPv6 tunnels. The changes are **architectural improvements** rather than security fixes. ## Key Points: 1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit moves initialization of `tunnel->net` from `ndo_init()` (called during `register_netdevice()`) to earlier in the device creation process. This is a **timing/ordering change**, not a security fix. 2. **Context from Commit Series**: This is part of a broader refactoring (commits cf517ac16ad9 through db014522f356) that standardizes how network devices handle cross-namespace tunnels and link namespaces. The series adds helper functions like `rtnl_newlink_link_net()` and `rtnl_newlink_peer_net()` for consistent namespace handling. 3. **No Security Implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues being fixed - No input validation improvements - No race conditions or privilege escalation fixes - The commit message mentions "lacks the context of link-netns" but this is about **functional correctness** for cross-network tunnels, not security 4. **Pattern Comparison**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - All marked "CVE Status: NO" are functional/correctness fixes - This commit follows the same pattern - it's improving namespace handling logic for proper tunnel operation 5. **Files Modified**: The changes are in IPv6 tunnel drivers (`ip6_gre.c`, `ip6_tunnel.c`, `ip6_vti.c`, `sit.c`) and only affect **when** the namespace assignment happens, not **what** namespace is assigned or **how** it's validated. The commit improves the architecture for cross-network tunnel support but does not fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited to cause harm.
ec061546c6cff rtnetlink: Lookup device in target netns when creating link
- [sasha] Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me analyze the security implications of this commit: **NO** This commit fixes a functional bug in namespace handling rather than a security vulnerability. Here's the analysis: **What the commit fixes:** The commit corrects device lookup logic during link creation to search in the target namespace (`tgt_net`) instead of the current namespace (`net`) when both `NLM_F_CREATE` and `NLM_F_EXCL` flags are set. **Why this is not a security issue:** 1. **Capability requirements remain unchanged**: All link creation operations still require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` in the target namespace's user namespace, as enforced at line 4038 in the kernel code. 2. **No privilege escalation**: The bug only affected which namespace was searched for existing devices, not the permission checks for creating new devices or accessing existing ones. 3. **Functional fix pattern**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 1 (marked NO CVE), which also fixed incorrect namespace usage in rtnetlink operations without security implications. 4. **No bypass of isolation**: The fix actually *strengthens* namespace isolation by ensuring device name conflicts are properly checked within the correct namespace boundaries, rather than creating a potential for confusion between namespaces. 5. **Limited scope**: The bug only affected the device existence check during creation with `NLM_F_CREATE|NLM_F_EXCL` flags - it didn't allow unauthorized access to devices in other namespaces or bypass any access controls. The commit resolves a namespace scoping bug that could prevent legitimate device creation or allow inappropriate device naming conflicts, but doesn't introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or isolation bypass.
ee509efc74ddb crypto: skcipher - Zap type in crypto_alloc_sync_skcipher
- [sasha] Perfect! Let me analyze the security issue. Based on the commit message and code changes, I can see that: 1. The function `crypto_alloc_sync_skcipher` is supposed to only allocate synchronous skcipher algorithms 2. The mask was already setting the bits to exclude async algorithms: `mask |= CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC | CRYPTO_ALG_SKCIPHER_REQSIZE_LARGE;` 3. However, the `type` parameter wasn't being properly sanitized - a user could pass in these flags in the `type` parameter to bypass the restriction 4. The fix adds: `type &= ~(CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC | CRYPTO_ALG_SKCIPHER_REQSIZE_LARGE);` which clears these bits from the type parameter This prevents a user from requesting an asynchronous skcipher when they should only get synchronous ones. **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. The vulnerability allows a user to bypass the intended restriction of `crypto_alloc_sync_skcipher` to only allocate synchronous algorithms. By passing `CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC` in the `type` parameter, a user could allocate an asynchronous skcipher through an API specifically designed for synchronous operations only. This could lead to: 1. **API Contract Violation**: Code expecting synchronous behavior might get asynchronous ciphers, potentially causing incorrect usage patterns 2. **Resource Management Issues**: Synchronous cipher users may not properly handle asynchronous completion callbacks 3. **Potential Memory Corruption**: Code designed for stack-based requests with sync ciphers could be used with async ciphers requiring different memory management The fix properly sanitizes the `type` parameter by clearing the async-related bits, ensuring only synchronous algorithms can be allocated through this API regardless of what the caller passes in the `type` parameter.
4087e16b03314 x86/locking: Use ALT_OUTPUT_SP() for percpu_{,try_}cmpxchg{64,128}_op()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this kernel commit, I can now provide a comprehensive security assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Key Findings: 1. **Build/Correctness Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: This change addresses objtool warnings and frame pointer validation issues during kernel builds, not an exploitable security vulnerability. 2. **Pattern Consistent with Similar Commits**: All the similar commits provided as reference (commits 1-5) also dealt with ALT_OUTPUT_SP() usage and assembly constraint fixes, and none were assigned CVEs. This commit follows the exact same pattern. 3. **Technical Analysis**: - The change adds `ALT_OUTPUT_SP()` wrapper around assembly output constraints for percpu cmpxchg operations - This ensures proper dependency tracking for functions that use CALL instructions in inline assembly - Prevents objtool "call without frame pointer save/setup" warnings - No change to actual functionality or security boundaries 4. **No Direct Security Impact**: - No buffer overflows, memory corruption, or privilege escalation being fixed - No input validation improvements or access control changes - No race conditions or other exploitable conditions being addressed 5. **Defense-in-Depth Enhancement**: While this improves build validation and stack integrity checking (which has security benefits), it's not fixing an exploitable vulnerability. The commit message clearly states this is about adding "required dependence on %esp register" to prevent compiler scheduling issues and objtool warnings, not fixing a security flaw. This aligns perfectly with the pattern of the reference commits that were correctly classified as "CVE Status: NO".
80df31f384b41 net/mlx5: Change POOL_NEXT_SIZE define value and make it global
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the issue described in the commit message. Let me analyze the security implications: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's the analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a correctness/resource management fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit changes `POOL_NEXT_SIZE` from 0 to `BIT(30)` (1GB) and renames it to `MLX5_FS_MAX_POOL_SIZE`. 2. **The underlying issue**: The commit message clearly states that "some places in the driver use zero explicitly expecting the smallest table size possible but instead due to this define they end up allocating the biggest table size unawarely." This means: - Before the fix: When code requested 0 entries (expecting smallest table), it actually got the largest possible table due to the flow table allocation logic - After the fix: The constant is properly named and valued to reflect its true purpose 3. **Impact analysis**: - **No memory corruption**: This doesn't involve buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption - **No privilege escalation**: No changes to access controls or privilege boundaries - **No input validation issues**: This is about internal resource allocation sizing - **Resource management only**: The issue is about unintended large memory allocations, which could cause resource exhaustion but not security breaches 4. **Evidence from code changes**: - The fix updates the allocation logic in `fs_ft_pool.c` to properly handle the renamed constant - In `en_rep.c`, there's explicit code that sets `ft_attr.max_fte = 0` with a comment "Empty table, miss rule will always point to next table" - this shows intentional use of 0 for empty tables - The changes are all about making the naming and logic consistent, not fixing exploitable conditions 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar networking/driver fixes that don't introduce security vulnerabilities, just like this one. This is a driver optimization/correctness fix that prevents unintended large memory allocations, but it doesn't address any exploitable security vulnerability that could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise.
7ffb791423c7c x86/kaslr: Reduce KASLR entropy on most x86 systems
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and understanding of KASLR, I can now make a determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is a security feature reduction, not a vulnerability fix. The commit intentionally reduces KASLR entropy when `CONFIG_PCI_P2PDMA=y` to prevent PCI peer-to-peer DMA mapping failures. 2. **Not a Security Bug Fix**: The commit message clearly states this is a design trade-off: "This reduces the total available entropy, but it's better than the current work around of having to disable KASLR completely." This indicates it's an improvement over the existing workaround, not fixing a vulnerability. 3. **Intentional Security vs. Functionality Trade-off**: The code change in `arch/x86/mm/kaslr.c` line 123 specifically adds a condition `!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PCI_P2PDMA)` to preserve full address space mapping when P2PDMA is enabled. This is a conscious design decision documented in the Kconfig help text. 4. **No Evidence of Exploitable Condition**: The change addresses a functional issue (PCI P2P DMA failures) rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The reduced entropy (from 16 bits to 15 bits as documented) is an acknowledged cost, not an unintended security weakness. 5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: Like the reference commits that received "CVE Status: NO", this is an infrastructure/configuration change that impacts security features but doesn't fix an exploitable vulnerability. The commit explicitly documents the security impact in the Kconfig file and provides this as a better alternative to completely disabling KASLR, making it a transparent security vs. functionality trade-off rather than a vulnerability fix.
239860828f866 bpf: arm64: Silence "UBSAN: negation-overflow" warning
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me look at how this affects similar commits that were marked as CVE-worthy vs not: Based on my analysis of the commit, code changes, and similar historical commits: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a UBSAN (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer) warning about negating INT_MIN (-2147483648), which cannot be represented in a signed 32-bit integer. The issue occurs in the BPF JIT compiler when processing immediate values. 2. **Code changes analysis**: The fix simply casts `imm` to `u32` before negation in three locations: - Line 277: `is_addsub_imm(-(u32)imm)` - Line 1286: `is_addsub_imm(-(u32)imm)` - Line 1457: `is_addsub_imm(-(u32)imm)` 3. **No security impact**: - This is purely a compiler/tooling warning, not a runtime security vulnerability - The undefined behavior doesn't lead to exploitable conditions - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypass - The BPF JIT compiler functionality remains correct before and after the fix 4. **Comparison with historical commits**: - Similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which were marked CVE Status: NO - Those commits also fixed UBSAN/compiler warnings without security implications - Unlike "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" which had actual security impacts (integer overflow leading to memory issues, potential for exploitation) 5. **Context**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "silence" UBSAN warnings, indicating it's a code quality/warning fix rather than a security fix. This is a code hygiene improvement to eliminate undefined behavior warnings, not a security vulnerability fix.
eb963d7948ce6 clk: sunxi-ng: h616: Reparent GPU clock during frequency changes
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit addresses a hardware stability issue but does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** 1. **Hardware Stability Fix**: The commit fixes GPU hangs and "panfrost various ooops" that occur during Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) operations on the H616 SoC's GPU 2. **Clock Reparenting**: It implements a clock reparenting mechanism that temporarily switches the GPU clock to a stable source (GPU1 clock at 400MHz) during PLL frequency changes, similar to what's already done for CPU clocks 3. **Hardware Limitation Workaround**: The H616 manual doesn't indicate that GPU PLL supports dynamic frequency changes, so this provides a safe workaround **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The issue affects system stability during legitimate GPU frequency scaling operations, not security boundaries 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The crashes and hangs don't provide attackers with elevated privileges or unauthorized access 3. **Hardware Design Issue**: This is fundamentally a hardware limitation/bug in the H616 SoC's GPU PLL implementation, not a software security flaw 4. **Administrative Operation**: DVFS typically requires administrative privileges to trigger **Comparison with similar commits:** - Similar commits in the historical examples (like the H6 CPU reparenting) were marked as CVE-worthy because they could cause system crashes during normal operations - However, this GPU-specific issue affects a more limited scope (GPU DVFS operations) and represents a hardware limitation rather than a software vulnerability While the commit fixes crashes and system instability, these issues stem from hardware limitations rather than exploitable software vulnerabilities, making it unsuitable for CVE assignment.
88f7f56d16f56 dm: fix unconditional IO throttle caused by REQ_PREFLUSH
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security analysis: **Primary Security Issue**: The code fix addresses an unconditional IO throttling bug that creates a denial of service vulnerability. The commit message explicitly shows that critical metadata operations (like XFS log writes) were being unintentionally throttled due to flush_bio operations being created with `REQ_OP_WRITE | REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_SYNC`, causing them to be throttled by `wbt_wait()`. **Key Security Implications**: 1. **Denial of Service Vector**: The improper throttling can cause system-wide performance degradation and potential hangs, as evidenced by the stack trace showing a worker thread blocked in `wbt_wait()`. 2. **Performance Isolation Violation**: In multi-tenant environments, this bug breaks performance isolation boundaries - one tenant's flush operations could unintentionally impact system-wide performance. 3. **Critical System Component Impact**: The device mapper (dm) layer is fundamental infrastructure. Throttling issues here affect all storage operations, making this a high-impact availability issue. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds conditional logic to preserve `REQ_IDLE` flags from the original bio: ```c if ((ci->io->orig_bio->bi_opf & (REQ_IDLE | REQ_SYNC)) == (REQ_IDLE | REQ_SYNC)) opf |= REQ_IDLE; ``` This prevents unnecessary throttling when the original operation was marked with both `REQ_IDLE` and `REQ_SYNC`, which should bypass write-back throttling. While not a traditional memory corruption vulnerability, this represents a significant **availability security issue** that can be exploited for denial of service attacks and violates performance isolation in shared computing environments.
f69da85d5d5cc scsi: scsi_debug: First fixes for tapes
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, this is primarily a bug fix and feature enhancement for tape drive support in the scsi_debug module, not a security vulnerability fix. **Reasoning:** 1. **Functionality Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit adds legitimate tape drive functionality (MODE SENSE/SELECT support for block descriptors, density/block size storage) rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. 2. **Adequate Input Validation**: The code includes proper validation: - Block size alignment checking (`(blksize % 4) != 0`) - Block descriptor length validation (`bd_len != 8`) - Buffer bounds checking (`off >= res`) - Parameter length limits (`SDEBUG_MAX_MSELECT_SZ`) 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The scsi_debug module is primarily used for testing/development, not production systems, significantly limiting potential security impact. 4. **No Privilege Escalation**: The changes don't introduce new privilege escalation vectors or bypass existing access controls. 5. **Reference Pattern Match**: This commit follows the pattern of "Similar Commit 1, 2, 3, 4" (all marked "CVE Status: NO") which were functional improvements and bug fixes in SCSI subsystems without security implications. While there was initially insufficient block size bounds validation in the original commit, this gap was addressed in subsequent development and doesn't represent an actively exploitable vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
dcf8f3bffa2de gpiolib: sanitize the return value of gpio_chip::set_config()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit based on my findings: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary The commit is a **defensive programming measure** that sanitizes return values from GPIO driver callbacks, not a fix for an actual security vulnerability. ## Key Findings 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds validation to check if `gpio_chip::set_config()` returns positive values and converts them to `-EBADE` (invalid exchange). This is purely defensive coding to enforce API contracts. 2. **No Vulnerability Evidence**: - The commit message indicates this is preventive: "If a bad driver returns a positive number, it may confuse user programs" - No actual security impact is described - No mention of existing vulnerable drivers or exploitable conditions 3. **API Contract Enforcement**: The change tightens the API contract by: - Adding validation that positive return values are converted to error codes - Updating documentation to clarify expected return values - Preventing user-space confusion, not preventing exploitation 4. **Similar Pattern**: This is part of a series of commits (as seen with commit `69920338f813` for `gpio_chip::request()`) that sanitize GPIO driver return values as a general cleanup/hardening effort. 5. **Real-world Impact**: Examining actual GPIO drivers (like `gpio-max77650.c`), they typically return values from `regmap_update_bits()` which returns 0 on success or negative error codes - positive values would be rare/abnormal but not necessarily security-critical. 6. **User-space Propagation**: While return values can reach user-space, receiving an unexpected positive value would typically just cause application logic errors, not security vulnerabilities. This is an **API hardening/cleanup commit** rather than a security fix, similar to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO".
236d3910117e9 libbpf: Fix out-of-bound read
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE. **CVE Status: YES** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a clear out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libbpf's kernel configuration parsing functionality. Here's why it should receive a CVE: 1. **Legitimate security vulnerability**: The code accesses `value[len - 1]` without ensuring the string is at least 2 characters long. With a single-character string containing just a quote (`"`), `len` would be 1, and `value[len - 1]` would access `value[0]` (the opening quote), but the logic incorrectly assumes this is checking for a closing quote. 2. **Out-of-bounds read potential**: While the specific case described might not cause an immediate crash, the vulnerability represents a class of buffer access errors that can lead to information disclosure through reading adjacent memory. 3. **Untrusted input processing**: The function processes kernel configuration strings that could potentially come from external sources (config files, user input). The commit message explicitly mentions "untrusted string." 4. **Similarity to assigned CVEs**: This is very similar to the bonding driver commits (Similar Commits 2 & 3) that received CVE assignments for out-of-bounds reads with similar characteristics - both involve inadequate input validation leading to potential buffer overreads. 5. **Security impact**: libbpf is a critical component used by eBPF programs and tools. A vulnerability in input parsing could potentially be exploited by malicious configuration files or inputs. The fix is straightforward (adding `len < 2` check) but addresses a real security issue in a security-sensitive component, making it appropriate for CVE assignment.
352bc4513ec39 net: stmmac: Correct usage of maximum queue number macros
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see that both `MTL_MAX_RX_QUEUES` and `MTL_MAX_TX_QUEUES` are defined as 8. Let me analyze the security implications of this fix: **Analysis:** **NO** This commit corrects macro usage for array sizing but does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Same Values**: Both `MTL_MAX_RX_QUEUES` and `MTL_MAX_TX_QUEUES` are defined as 8, so the incorrect macro usage resulted in arrays of the same size as intended. 2. **No Buffer Overflows**: The changes only affect: - `stmmac_pcpu_stats` struct member array sizing - `rx_coal_frames`, `rx_riwt`, and `int_name_rx_irq` array sizing Since both macros have identical values, there were no buffer overflows or undersized arrays. 3. **Consistency Fix**: This is purely a consistency and maintainability fix to prevent future issues if the macro values ever diverge. 4. **No Access Control Impact**: The changes don't affect memory management, input validation, privilege escalation, or other security-sensitive operations. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") involved similar non-security driver fixes like queue management corrections, priority assignments, and parameter validation - none warranted CVEs. This commit follows the same pattern as the reference commits that were correctly classified as not requiring CVEs. It's a preventive code quality improvement rather than a security fix.
83a9d30d29f27 scsi: mpi3mr: Update timestamp only for supervisor IOCs
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a functional issue rather than a security vulnerability. The code change adds a capability check to prevent timestamp update commands from being sent to non-supervisor IOCs, which would fail anyway. Key analysis points: 1. **Nature of Change**: The commit adds a capability check (`MPI3_IOCFACTS_CAPABILITY_NON_SUPERVISOR_IOC`) to only send timestamp sync commands to supervisor IOCs, preventing unnecessary failed commands. 2. **No Security Impact**: The timestamp synchronization operation (`mpi3mr_sync_timestamp`) is a benign administrative function that syncs host time with firmware time. It doesn't affect access control, memory management, or privilege boundaries. 3. **Error Handling Already Present**: The existing code already had proper error handling for failed timestamp commands - this change simply prevents the predictable failures from occurring in the first place. 4. **Similar Reference Commits**: Comparing to the provided examples, the commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved race conditions, buffer overflows, or synchronization issues with security implications. This commit is purely operational optimization. 5. **No Sensitive Data**: The change doesn't involve sensitive data handling, input validation, or security-critical code paths that could be exploited. This is a reliability/efficiency improvement that prevents wasteful command attempts rather than addressing any exploitable vulnerability.
f6f9e32fe1e45 loop: check in LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO in loop_default_blocksize
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Code Change Analysis The commit makes a simple one-line change in `loop_default_blocksize()`: - **Before**: `if ((lo->lo_backing_file->f_flags & O_DIRECT) && backing_bdev)` - **After**: `if ((lo->lo_flags & LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO) && backing_bdev)` ## Why This Is Not a Security Vulnerability 1. **Functional Equivalence**: The change switches from checking the `O_DIRECT` flag on the backing file to checking the `LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO` flag on the loop device itself. Both indicate direct I/O mode is enabled, but `LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO` is more comprehensive as it covers both cases where direct I/O is enabled via `O_DIRECT` file opening OR via explicit loop flags. 2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: This is purely an internal implementation improvement for determining the appropriate block size. The function still returns the same values (`bdev_logical_block_size(backing_bdev)` for direct I/O or `SECTOR_SIZE` otherwise). 3. **Refactoring, Not Bug Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is about using a more appropriate flag check "Now that LO_FLAGS_DIRECT_IO is set earlier after assigning a backing file". This indicates a code improvement rather than fixing a vulnerability. 4. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and are also refactoring/cleanup commits in the loop driver. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a code improvement without security implications. 5. **No Mention of Security**: The commit message, author, and review process show no indication this fixes a security issue. It's authored by Christoph Hellwig, a well-known kernel maintainer, and reviewed normally without security urgency markers. This is a code quality improvement that makes the flag checking more consistent and comprehensive, but does not fix any security vulnerability.
8bd2fa086a048 virtio: break and reset virtio devices on device_shutdown()
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security analysis: **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a use-after-reset vulnerability where virtio devices continue accessing MMIO regions after device reset during kexec operations, causing invalid memory accesses and system hangs. **Key Security Issues**: 1. **Memory Safety Violation**: Devices write to memory regions after being reset, shown by "Invalid read/write" errors in the commit message 2. **IOMMU Security Bypass**: Continued device memory access after IOMMU reset bypasses established security boundaries 3. **Denial of Service**: Causes complete system hangs during kexec (critical for live kernel updates) 4. **Broad Impact**: Affects all virtio devices in virtualized environments **Code Analysis**: The fix in `virtio_dev_shutdown()` properly addresses the vulnerability by: - `virtio_break_device()` - Marks all virtqueues as broken to prevent further operations - `virtio_synchronize_cbs()` - Ensures memory ordering so callbacks see the broken state - `dev->config->reset()` - Performs actual device reset to stop all activity This represents a clear security boundary violation with reliability impact, affecting critical system operations, and should receive CVE assignment similar to other virtio security fixes in the historical examples.
78d7265e2e1ce media: tc358746: improve calculation of the D-PHY timing registers
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and understanding of the tc358746 driver, this commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **Pure Calculation Accuracy Fix**: The commit only improves the precision of D-PHY timing register calculations by changing from MHz to Hz units. The core issue is precision loss in division operations, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Standards Compliance, Not Security**: The timing violations mentioned are violations of the MIPI D-PHY standard (e.g., shorter than 100µs minimum), which affect device functionality and interoperability, but don't create exploitable security vulnerabilities. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes are purely mathematical - replacing `DIV_ROUND_UP()` with `div64_u64()` and adjusting time units. There are no buffer overflows, memory corruption, or access control issues. 4. **Functional vs Security Bug**: This is a functional correctness issue where incorrect timing calculations could cause: - Device malfunctions - Signal integrity problems - Standards non-compliance But these don't translate to exploitable security vulnerabilities. 5. **Similar Commit Patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: NO" include other calculation precision fixes and hardware configuration corrections that don't have security implications - this follows the same pattern. The commit improves hardware timing precision to meet MIPI standards but doesn't fix any exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
439252e167ac4 vdpa/mlx5: Fix mlx5_vdpa_get_config() endianness on big-endian machines
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, this commit should be assigned: **NO** This is a bug fix that addresses incorrect data representation on big-endian machines, but it does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the issue**: The bug causes `mlx5_vdpa_get_config()` to return data with incorrect endianness on big-endian machines when called before driver features are set. The data is returned as big-endian when QEMU expects little-endian. 2. **Impact assessment**: This is a data corruption/compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. The endianness mismatch would cause: - Incorrect interpretation of configuration data by QEMU - Potential device malfunction or initialization failures - But no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or security boundary violations 3. **Code changes**: The fix simply initializes `mvdev->actual_features` with the `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` flag earlier in the device initialization process. This ensures the endianness conversion functions work correctly from the start. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this commit is most similar to the "NO CVE" commits that fix initialization/compatibility issues rather than security vulnerabilities. The fix is straightforward initialization ordering, not addressing buffer overflows, access control, or other security-sensitive patterns. 5. **Security implications**: There are no apparent security implications - this is purely a functional correctness issue affecting data representation on specific architectures. The commit fixes a bug but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously.
85e4a808af254 net/mlx5e: Add correct match to check IPSec syndromes for switchdev mode
- [sasha] **CVE Status: YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Vulnerability Analysis **Issue:** The commit fixes incorrect metadata register usage in IPSec syndrome checking for switchdev mode, which could lead to authentication bypass. **Key Security Problems:** 1. **Authentication Bypass Risk:** The code was checking the wrong metadata register (`metadata_reg_c_2` instead of the correct register for switchdev mode). This means IPSec authentication failure syndromes might not be properly detected, allowing malformed or unauthenticated packets to bypass security checks. 2. **Metadata Register Confusion:** In switchdev mode, MLX5 uses `metadata_reg_c_1` with a specific layout for IPSec object ID mapping, but the syndrome checking was using `metadata_reg_c_2`. This mismatch could cause: - Authentication failures to go undetected - Incorrect packet classification and processing - Potential security policy bypass 3. **Code Evidence:** The fix introduces `ipsec_rx_rule_add_match_obj()` function that properly differentiates between switchdev (`mlx5_esw_ipsec_rx_rule_add_match_obj()`) and legacy modes, ensuring correct register matching for syndrome detection. **Attack Scenario:** An attacker could send crafted IPSec packets that would normally trigger authentication failure syndromes, but due to the incorrect register checking, these failures wouldn't be detected in switchdev mode, potentially allowing unauthorized network access. **Security Impact:** - **Confidentiality:** High - IPSec authentication bypass - **Integrity:** High - Security policy circumvention - **Availability:** Low - No direct DoS impact This is a hardware-offloaded network security vulnerability affecting IPSec authentication in virtualized/switchdev environments, warranting CVE assignment.
a980bc5f56b02 media: adv7180: Disable test-pattern control on adv7180
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** The commit fixes a device compatibility issue where test pattern controls were being exposed on ADV7180 devices that don't actually support the test pattern hardware feature. The fix adds a flag (`ADV7180_FLAG_TEST_PATTERN`) to properly identify which device variants support test patterns and only registers the V4L2 test pattern control for supported devices (ADV7280/7281/7282 series). **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Functionality Fix, Not Security Fix**: This is a device driver correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit message makes no mention of security concerns, crashes, or exploitable conditions. 2. **No Security Impact**: The change prevents userspace from accessing a non-functional control interface on unsupported hardware. Previously, users could attempt to set test patterns on ADV7180 devices, but since the hardware doesn't support it, the operations would simply have no effect or potentially return errors. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The code changes don't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other memory safety issues that could lead to privilege escalation or system compromise. 4. **No Access Control Bypass**: This isn't fixing unauthorized access to sensitive hardware registers or capabilities - it's preventing access to a non-existent feature. 5. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar device driver correctness issues rather than security vulnerabilities. This is a hardware compatibility fix that prevents userspace confusion about device capabilities, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
891b99eab0f89 vhost-scsi: Return queue full for page alloc failures during copy
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes an error handling robustness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The key changes are: 1. **Proper error code differentiation**: The code now distinguishes between memory allocation failures (`-ENOMEM`) and memory access faults (`-EFAULT`) instead of always returning `-ENOMEM` 2. **Improved error propagation**: The function now properly captures and returns the specific error type, allowing the caller to handle different failure modes appropriately 3. **Better guest communication**: Memory allocation failures now result in `SAM_STAT_TASK_SET_FULL` being returned to the guest, enabling proper flow control and retry logic While this improves system robustness and prevents potential denial-of-service scenarios under memory pressure, it doesn't fix a classical security vulnerability like memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. The memory management itself was already correct - this just improves how allocation failures are handled and communicated. The pattern is consistent with the similar commits provided as reference, which were all marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with error handling improvements and robustness fixes in the vhost-scsi subsystem rather than actual security vulnerabilities.
fe37c699ae3ee x86/nmi: Add an emergency handler in nmi_desc & use it in nmi_shootdown_cpus()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context provided by examining similar issues, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a lockdep warning about "inconsistent lock state" in NMI context, not an exploitable security vulnerability. The warning occurs when `__register_nmi_handler()` is called from NMI context during crash handling, which could potentially lead to deadlock. 2. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the changes: - The commit adds an `emerg_handler` field to `nmi_desc` structure - It introduces `set_emergency_nmi_handler()` to avoid taking locks in NMI context - In `nmi_shootdown_cpus()`, it replaces `register_nmi_handler()` (which takes locks) with `set_emergency_nmi_handler()` (which doesn't) 3. **Security vs. Correctness**: This is fundamentally a correctness/reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability: - The lockdep warning is a debugging tool to detect potential deadlocks - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure is involved - The issue occurs during crash/panic scenarios, not normal operation - The fix prevents system hangs during crash handling, improving reliability 4. **Comparison with Similar Cases**: Based on the similar commits analyzed: - Similar Commit 1 (arm64 SMP stop) - **NO CVE**: Also deals with CPU stopping mechanisms and timing issues - Similar Commit 3 (x86 microcode NMI) - **NO CVE**: NMI handler improvements for correctness - Similar Commit 4 (x86 NMI inverse check) - **NO CVE**: Fix for incorrect NMI state checking 5. **Context and Impact**: The issue only manifests during system crash scenarios when `nmi_shootdown_cpus()` is called, and the fix improves system stability during crash handling rather than preventing exploitation. This is a kernel stability improvement that eliminates a lockdep warning and potential deadlock during crash scenarios, but does not represent an exploitable security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
bf1800073f4d5 ASoC: mediatek: mt8188: Add reference for dmic clocks
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a straightforward new feature addition that adds clock references for DMIC (Digital Microphone) functionality to the MediaTek MT8188 ASoC driver. The code changes are minimal and low-risk: 1. **Simple clock name additions**: The commit only adds static string names for 8 DMIC-related clocks (`aud_afe_dmic1-4` and `aud_dmic_hires1-4`) to the existing `aud_clks` array and corresponding enum definitions. 2. **Infrastructure enhancement**: This enables the platform driver to properly acquire and manage DMIC clocks through the standard Linux clock framework - this is normal feature development, not a security fix. 3. **No security implications**: The changes involve no input validation, access control, memory management, or other security-sensitive operations. It's purely adding static clock references. 4. **Part of feature series**: Analysis of the kernel tree shows this is part of a comprehensive patch series adding complete DMIC support to MT8188, indicating planned feature development rather than urgent bug fixing. 5. **Consistent with similar commits**: The pattern matches other non-CVE MediaTek audio commits that add hardware support infrastructure without addressing security vulnerabilities. The commit represents standard kernel development for adding new hardware support rather than fixing any security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
7d87bde21c737 ASoC: mediatek: mt8188: Treat DMIC_GAINx_CUR as non-volatile
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and context from the kernel tree, this is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit removes four register addresses (`DMIC_GAIN1_CUR`, `DMIC_GAIN2_CUR`, `DMIC_GAIN3_CUR`, `DMIC_GAIN4_CUR`) from the volatile register list in the `mt8188_is_volatile_reg()` function. 2. **Purpose**: The change is purely about register caching behavior in the regmap subsystem. By marking these registers as non-volatile, the driver will use cached values instead of reading directly from hardware, which avoids unnecessary power management operations. 3. **Security implications**: None. This is a performance optimization that: - Reduces power consumption by avoiding PM runtime operations - Changes how register values are read (cached vs direct hardware access) - Does not affect memory safety, access control, input validation, or any security-sensitive functionality 4. **Context comparison**: This commit is very similar to the provided reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") that also deal with volatile register configuration changes in audio drivers. Like those commits, this is a driver configuration change that doesn't introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities. 5. **Risk assessment**: The change affects audio gain control registers in a MediaTek audio driver - this is not a security-sensitive component and the modification only changes caching behavior, not the actual register functionality or access controls.
26873260d394b drm/amd/display: Fix mismatch type comparison
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit changes signed integers to unsigned integers for variables that represent counts and levels that are inherently non-negative values. Specifically: 1. **max_taps_y, max_taps_c, min_taps_y, min_taps_c**: These represent hardware tap counts in display scaling operations, which are always positive values calculated from ratios and hardware constraints (lines 1015-1041 in dc_spl.c). 2. **sharpness_level**: This represents a sharpness configuration level that is calculated from positive scaling ratios and used for display sharpening algorithms. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No Buffer Overflow Risk**: The changes are simple type conversions from `int` to `unsigned int` for variables that logically should never be negative. The commit message specifically states "values are always non-negative." 2. **Data Loss Prevention, Not Security**: The commit addresses potential data loss from signed/unsigned comparison warnings, which is a code quality issue rather than a security vulnerability. 3. **No Memory Safety Impact**: The variables are used in calculations and comparisons (lines 1043-1052) but don't directly control memory allocation or array indexing in a way that could cause buffer overflows. 4. **Hardware Configuration Values**: These are display hardware configuration parameters for scaling operations, not security-sensitive data paths. 5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (like the pointer assignment revert) involved code quality fixes rather than security vulnerabilities, while "CVE Status: YES" commits involved actual divide-by-zero prevention or bounds checking issues. This is a defensive programming improvement to prevent potential integer comparison issues, but it does not address an exploitable security vulnerability.
0d3004647631a drm/amd/display: fix check for identity ratio
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Code Change Analysis The commit changes a macro definition from `spl_fixpt_u2d19(ratio)` to `spl_fixpt_u3d19(ratio)` in the `IDENTITY_RATIO` check. This increases the integer bit width from 2 bits to 3 bits, expanding the supported downscale ratio check from 3x to 6x. ## Why This Is Not a Security Issue 1. **Functional correctness fix, not security**: The issue is that the hardware supports 6x downscaling but the software check was incorrectly limited to 3x due to insufficient bit allocation. This is a functional limitation fix, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Adds safety assertions**: The commit actually improves safety by adding `SPL_ASSERT` checks to ensure downscale ratios don't exceed the 6x hardware limit, making the code more robust against invalid inputs. 3. **No memory corruption or privilege issues**: The fix involves changing bit field interpretation in a macro used for ratio comparison. There's no evidence of buffer overflows, memory corruption, or privilege escalation risks. 4. **Display subsystem context**: This affects AMD display scaling logic - a graphics rendering optimization feature. While incorrect scaling ratios could cause visual artifacts, this doesn't create exploitable security conditions. 5. **Similar to non-CVE examples**: This resembles Similar Commit 3 (graphics performance optimization) and Similar Commit 4 (type conversion warning fix) - both marked as non-CVE functional improvements. The commit message focuses on correctness ("fix check") rather than security implications, and the code changes demonstrate a straightforward parameter expansion to match hardware capabilities rather than addressing a vulnerability.
23ef388a84c72 drm/amd/display: fix dcn4x init failed
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and comparing it to the reference examples, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Primary Purpose is Functional, Not Security**: The commit fixes DCN4x initialization failure due to missing command table creation. The core issue is hardware compatibility/initialization, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Changes Are Defensive Improvements**: The code modifications actually improve security by: - Removing `dm_output_to_console()` debug messages that could leak hardware information - Replacing `BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER()` calls with graceful fallback behavior - Providing fallback command tables instead of hard failures 3. **No Exploitable Security Weakness**: There's no evidence of: - Memory corruption vulnerabilities - Privilege escalation potential - Access control bypasses - Information disclosure vulnerabilities (the changes actually reduce disclosure) 4. **Comparison with Reference Examples**: This is most similar to "Similar Commit 1" (static BP_RESULT fix) and "Similar Commit 4" (FAM control improvement) - both marked as CVE Status: NO. These were functional driver fixes without security implications. 5. **Initialization Robustness**: The changes make the driver more robust by providing fallback behavior for unsupported hardware versions, which improves system stability rather than fixing a security flaw. The commit addresses a legitimate hardware initialization problem and actually enhances security posture by removing debug output and improving error handling, but it does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
e451630226bd0 x86/build: Fix broken copy command in genimage.sh when making isoimage
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific issue mentioned in the commit: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a build system fix that addresses a broken shell command when creating ISO images during kernel compilation. The issue is in line 255-257 of `genimage.sh` where the script attempts to copy initrd files without checking if the array is empty. 2. **No Security Impact**: - The bug causes a build failure with error "cp: missing destination file operand", not a security vulnerability - This only affects the build process (`make isoimage`), not runtime kernel behavior - The fix simply adds a conditional check `if [ ${#FDINITRDS[@]} -gt 0 ]; then` before executing the copy command 3. **Build-time Only**: The script `genimage.sh` is a build tool used during kernel compilation to create bootable images. It doesn't affect kernel security, memory management, access control, or any runtime security mechanisms. 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this follows the same pattern as other build system fixes that were marked "CVE Status: NO": - Similar to "x86/boot: Don't add the EFI stub to targets" - build system fix - Similar to "video: logo: Drop full path" - build process improvement - Similar to "x86/boot: Drop references to startup_64" - build tool cleanup 5. **Impact Assessment**: The bug only prevents successful completion of `make isoimage` when no initrd files are provided. It doesn't create any attack vectors, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure opportunities. This is a straightforward build system bug fix with no security implications.
86f06bcbb54e9 drm/amd/display: Fix mismatch type comparison in custom_float
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader codebase context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: **Primary Issue Analysis:** The commit fixes a type mismatch where `uint` values were being cast to `unsigned char` parameters in shift functions. In `spl_fixpt31_32.c:332`, the code was casting `m` (which could be larger than 255) to `unsigned char`, causing truncation. **Why This Is Not CVE-Worthy:** 1. **Limited Security Impact**: While the type mismatch could cause truncation (e.g., a shift value of 256 becoming 0), this affects mathematical calculations in fixed-point arithmetic rather than creating exploitable security vulnerabilities. 2. **Functional vs. Security Bug**: The primary consequence is incorrect display calculations that would likely manifest as visible display issues rather than security compromises. The affected code is in the display pipeline for mathematical transformations. 3. **Bounded Context**: The `spl_fixpt_shl` function has built-in assertions that check for overflow conditions. Even with type truncation, the function maintains bounds checking that prevents dangerous operations. 4. **Similar Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this matches the pattern of commit 4 (CVE Status: NO) which also fixed type mismatches with format specifiers but was not considered security-relevant. **Comparison to CVE-Worthy Examples:** The CVE-worthy examples (commits 1, 2, 3, 5) involved null pointer dereferences, infinite loops, integer overflows in security-critical contexts, or divide-by-zero conditions. This commit addresses type correctness in mathematical operations without the same security implications. This is a code quality and correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
02a940da2ccc0 drm/amd/display: handle max_downscale_src_width fail check
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it does fix a potential divide-by-zero issue, the analysis shows: 1. **Non-Security Impact**: The commit fixes a divide-by-zero condition in the DML (Display Mode Library) validation by ensuring the scaling data structure has valid TAP values before early return. This prevents a crash but doesn't expose any security vulnerability. 2. **Code Change Analysis**: The fix moves the default TAP calculation (lines 433-463) to occur *before* the max_downscale_src_width check (lines 466-469), rather than after. This ensures `scl_data->taps` has valid values even when the function returns false due to downscaling limits being exceeded. 3. **Similar Pattern**: This follows a similar pattern to "Similar Commit 4" which was marked as CVE-worthy, but there's a key difference - Similar Commit 4 involved a shift-out-of-bounds issue that could potentially be exploited, while this commit only prevents a predictable divide-by-zero in display calculations. 4. **Context from Kernel Tree**: Looking at similar AMD display driver fixes like commit ab75a0d2e079, these divide-by-zero fixes in display drivers are typically stability fixes rather than security issues. They prevent crashes but don't create exploitable conditions. 5. **Limited Attack Surface**: This affects display scaling calculations in the AMD GPU driver, which operates in a controlled kernel context with no direct user input leading to the problematic condition. The fix prevents a kernel oops/crash but doesn't represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other malicious purposes.
a5caf03188e44 soc: ti: k3-socinfo: Do not use syscon helper to build regmap
- [sasha] Let me analyze this commit without the full git context. Based on the commit and comparing to the similar commits provided: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: 1. **Non-security nature**: This is a refactoring/code cleanup commit, not a security fix. The commit message explicitly states it's about not using "syscon helper to build regmap" and describes it as fixing a "hacky way to create a regmap." 2. **Pattern matching with similar commits**: All 5 similar commits provided have "CVE Status: NO" and show very similar changes: - Similar commit 1: "phy: ti: gmii-sel: Do not use syscon helper to build regmap" - identical pattern - All involve replacing `device_node_to_regmap()` with `regmap_init_mmio()` - All are refactoring syscon usage, not fixing vulnerabilities 3. **Code change analysis**: The changes in `drivers/soc/ti/k3-socinfo.c` show: - Replacement of `device_node_to_regmap(node)` with proper `devm_platform_ioremap_resource()` + `regmap_init_mmio()` - Addition of a standard `regmap_config` structure - No security-sensitive operations like buffer bounds checking, privilege validation, or memory leak fixes - The functionality remains identical - just using the proper API 4. **No security implications**: The code is only changing how a regmap is created for reading chip identification registers. This doesn't affect: - Memory safety - Access control - Input validation - Race conditions - Privilege escalation This is a pure code quality improvement to use the proper regmap initialization APIs, matching the exact same pattern as the provided similar commits that were all marked as not needing CVEs.
fc9167192f294 Octeontx2-af: RPM: Register driver with PCI subsys IDs
- [sasha] NO This commit adds PCI Subsystem ID matching to restrict driver binding to specific hardware variants, which is a device compatibility/hardware architecture change, not a security fix. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of Change**: The commit changes from using `PCI_DEVICE()` (which matches only vendor/device ID) to `PCI_DEVICE_SUB()` (which also matches subsystem IDs) for RPM devices. This restricts which devices the driver will bind to. 2. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to handle hardware architecture differences between CN10K and CN20K silicon - specifically to ensure the driver only binds to "NIX mapped RPMs" and not "RFOE Mapped RPMs". 3. **Security Implications**: This is a device identification/compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The change prevents incorrect driver binding to incompatible hardware variants, but doesn't address any exploitable security flaw. 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, those marked "CVE Status: NO" include similar device compatibility and initialization fixes, while the one marked "CVE Status: YES" involved missing error checking that could lead to exploitable conditions. 5. **Code Analysis**: The changes only modify the PCI device table entries and add new subsystem ID constants. No functional code paths, error handling, or security-sensitive operations are modified. This is a hardware compatibility fix to prevent driver binding to incorrect device variants, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
3ba075278c11c tcp: be less liberal in TSEcr received while in SYN_RECV state
- [sasha] Let me go back to analyzing the TCP timestamp commit: Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit implements a **hardening improvement** rather than fixing an exploitable security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Enhancement vs. Vulnerability Fix**: The commit message states "linux was not strict as other OS in 3WHS" - this indicates Linux was implementing TCP timestamp validation more leniently than other operating systems, but not that there was an exploitable vulnerability. 2. **Prophylactic Security Measure**: The code adds validation to check that TSEcr (Timestamp Echo Reply) values in incoming packets during the SYN_RECV state correspond to TSval values that were actually sent in SYNACK packets. This prevents potential spoofing attacks but doesn't fix a demonstrated exploit. 3. **Challenge ACK Response**: When invalid TSEcr values are detected, the system sends a challenge ACK and increments a counter (`LINUX_MIB_TSECRREJECTED`), which is consistent with RFC 5961 blind attack mitigation - a defensive measure rather than a vulnerability fix. 4. **Similar Pattern to Non-CVE Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the reference commits that received "CVE Status: NO" - particularly the first similar commit which also dealt with TCP timestamp handling improvements. 5. **No Demonstrated Attack**: The commit doesn't describe any specific attack scenario, exploitation method, or security impact - it's a proactive security improvement to align with RFC standards and other OS implementations. The key code change in `tcp_minisocks.c:677-682` adds timestamp validation: ```c if (inet_rsk(req)->tstamp_ok && !fastopen) tsecr_reject = !between(tmp_opt.rcv_tsecr, tcp_rsk(req)->snt_tsval_first, READ_ONCE(tcp_rsk(req)->snt_tsval_last)); ``` This is a defensive improvement to prevent potential future attacks rather than fixing an existing exploitable vulnerability.
e16acf907a3c6 wifi: rtw89: Parse channel from IE to correct invalid hardware reports during scanning
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit for security implications: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit addresses a functional issue with frequency reporting during WiFi scanning, not a security vulnerability. The problem is that the hardware sometimes fails to provide channel information in PPDU status, causing incorrect frequency reports. 2. **Code changes examination**: - Adds a new function `rtw89_core_update_rx_freq_from_ie()` that parses channel information from beacon/probe response Information Elements (IEs) - Only operates during scanning (`if (!rtwdev->scanning) return`) - Only processes beacon and probe response frames - Uses standard kernel functions like `cfg80211_get_ies_channel_number()` for parsing - Adds a chip capability flag `rx_freq_frome_ie` to control the feature 3. **Security impact assessment**: - **No buffer overflows**: The code properly validates buffer lengths (`if (skb->len > hdr_len)`) before accessing data - **No memory corruption**: Uses safe parsing functions and proper bounds checking - **No privilege escalation**: Only updates frequency information in rx_status structure - **No access control bypass**: Only affects frequency reporting during legitimate scanning - **No input validation issues**: Uses standard cfg80211 parsing functions designed for untrusted input 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - This is purely a functional improvement similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which fix debug formatting and timestamp issues respectively - Unlike "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 5" which address null pointer dereferences (actual security issues), this commit doesn't fix any crash conditions or memory safety issues The commit improves the accuracy of frequency reporting during scanning but doesn't address any security vulnerability. It's a quality-of-life improvement for WiFi functionality, not a security fix.
0da30874729ba dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-glue: Drop skip_fdq argument from k3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn
- [sasha] **Analysis:** Looking at this commit, I can see that it fixes a **resource leak issue** in the TI K3 UDMA glue driver. Let me analyze the key aspects: **1. The Problem:** - The commit message shows a kernel warning: `k3_knav_desc_pool size 512000 != avail 64000` - This indicates a descriptor pool leak where not all allocated descriptors are being properly freed - The error occurs during module removal (`modprobe -r ti_am65_cpsw_nuss`) **2. The Root Cause:** - The issue was caused by incorrect logic in `k3_udma_glue_reset_rx_chn()` when deciding whether to skip FDQ (Free Descriptor Queue) cleanup - The function relied on a user-provided `skip_fdq` parameter, which could be incorrect across different DMA architectures - When FDQ cleanup was incorrectly skipped, descriptors were not properly returned to the pool **3. The Fix:** - Replaces the unreliable user-provided `skip_fdq` parameter with an internal `single_fdq` flag - Sets `single_fdq = true` for UDMAP (traditional DMA) and `single_fdq = false` for PKTDMA - Changes the cleanup logic from `if (skip_fdq)` to `if (rx_chn->single_fdq && flow_num)` **4. Security Assessment:** - This is a **resource management bug** that leads to memory/descriptor leaks - It causes kernel warnings and resource exhaustion during driver unload - While it impacts system stability and resource management, it does not appear to introduce direct security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or information disclosure - The fix is about proper cleanup sequence, not preventing malicious exploitation **CVE Decision:** **NO** This commit fixes a resource leak/management issue that causes kernel warnings and improper cleanup during driver removal. While it affects system stability and resource management, it does not fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security attacks. The issue is a correctness bug in resource cleanup logic rather than a security flaw.
01358e8fe922f net: xgene-v2: remove incorrect ACPI_PTR annotation
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a compiler warning and does not introduce or fix any security vulnerability. The changes are purely cosmetic: 1. **Removes an unnecessary forward declaration** of `xge_acpi_match` that was causing compiler warnings 2. **Changes `ACPI_PTR(xge_acpi_match)` to just `xge_acpi_match`** in the platform driver structure This is identical in nature to the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO) that fix unused variable warnings by: - Moving variable declarations to appropriate conditional compilation blocks - Removing unnecessary preprocessor macros like `ACPI_PTR()` - Adding `__unused__` annotations The functionality remains exactly the same - this is purely a build warning fix with no security implications. The driver behavior, device matching, and all operational aspects are unchanged.
d519594ee2445 bpf: Search and add kfuncs in struct_ops prologue and epilogue
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the comprehensive security implications provided by the task analysis, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit is **not** fixing a security vulnerability - it's adding a **new feature** to support kfunc calls in struct_ops prologue and epilogue code. Here's my reasoning: **Analysis of the commit:** 1. **Purpose**: The commit is adding functionality to search for and register kfunc calls that are introduced during `gen_prologue` or `gen_epilogue` phases of struct_ops verification. This is new functionality, not a bug fix. 2. **Code changes**: The changes add a new helper function `add_kfunc_in_insns()` and call it in two locations within `convert_ctx_accesses()` to properly track kfuncs in prologue and epilogue instruction buffers. 3. **No security issue being fixed**: The commit message describes a functional limitation - "the verifier could not find the bpf_kfunc_btf_tab of a new kfunc call" - but doesn't indicate this was causing security vulnerabilities. Instead, it was preventing certain valid use cases from working. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar commits marked "NO" (like the kfunc btf caching fix) were fixing functional bugs without security implications - Similar commits marked "YES" were fixing actual vulnerabilities like stack unwinding issues or verification bypasses 5. **Preventive vs. Reactive**: This appears to be preventive code to ensure proper kfunc tracking for new functionality, rather than reactive code fixing an existing vulnerability. The comprehensive security analysis shows that missing kfunc tracking *could* lead to serious vulnerabilities, but this specific commit is implementing proper tracking from the start for new functionality, not fixing an existing security hole.
cd740b873f8f6 accel/amdxdna: Check interrupt register before mailbox_rx_worker exits
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a race condition in interrupt handling that causes mailbox timeouts, but it does not address a security vulnerability. The issue is purely a reliability problem where missed interrupts lead to command timeouts during stress testing. Unlike the CVE-worthy commits in the examples (which involved use-after-free vulnerabilities and memory corruption), this fix only rearranges interrupt acknowledgment timing and adds a re-check loop to ensure no responses are missed. There are no memory safety issues, privilege escalation concerns, or security boundary violations - just improved robustness against timing-related race conditions in the AMD XDNA accelerator driver.
6d91124e7edc1 leds: pwm-multicolor: Add check for fwnode_property_read_u32
- [sasha] **NO** This commit adds error checking for `fwnode_property_read_u32()` to handle the case where reading the `max-brightness` property fails. The code change is a defensive programming improvement that prevents the driver from continuing with an uninitialized `max_brightness` value. The similar commits provided as reference all show "CVE Status: NO" for comparable error checking additions (like the PWM STM32 driver checks for `clk_enable()`). This type of commit pattern - adding missing error checks for existing function calls - represents a robustness improvement rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. The security impact is minimal: if `fwnode_property_read_u32()` fails, `max_brightness` would remain at its default value (likely 0), which would affect LED functionality but not create a security vulnerability. The fix ensures proper error handling and early termination on invalid device tree configurations.
89eb42b5539f6 drm/xe: xe_gen_wa_oob: replace program_invocation_short_name
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Build System Fix Only**: This is purely a build compatibility fix for non-GNU systems. The commit replaces the GNU-specific `program_invocation_short_name` with portable `argv[0]` to get the program name. 2. **No Security Impact**: The changes are in `xe_gen_wa_oob.c`, which is a host program (build-time code generator) that creates workaround tables during kernel compilation. It does not run in kernel space or affect runtime security. 3. **Minimal Code Change**: The only functional change is replacing `program_invocation_short_name` with `argv[0]` in the `print_usage()` function for error messages. This has no impact on the generated code or kernel functionality. 4. **Similar Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this follows the same pattern as other build system and compatibility fixes that received "CVE Status: NO". 5. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes a build error when `program_invocation_short_name` is not available on certain systems (like macOS), not a security vulnerability. The change is purely for portability and build compatibility, with no security implications whatsoever.
27d38bdfd416f wifi: ath12k: Improve BSS discovery with hidden SSID in 6 GHz band
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. While the analysis reveals potential security concerns, this is a **functional improvement** rather than a **security vulnerability fix**. **Key Analysis Points:** 1. **Nature of Change**: The commit increases WiFi scan dwell times from 30ms to 70ms for 6GHz band discovery - this is a performance optimization for hidden SSID detection, not a security bug fix. 2. **No Vulnerability Pattern**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commits in the reference examples (which fix buffer overflows, parameter validation issues, or memory corruption), this commit only adjusts timing parameters for better functionality. 3. **Code Changes**: The modifications in `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/wmi.c` only change two constant values: - `arg->dwell_time_active_6g = 40;` → `arg->dwell_time_active_6g = 70;` - `arg->dwell_time_passive_6g = 30;` → `arg->dwell_time_passive_6g = 70;` 4. **Commit Message Focus**: Describes functional improvement for "BSS discovery with hidden SSID" rather than security concerns, vulnerability fixes, or memory safety issues. 5. **Reference Comparison**: Similar to the "NO CVE" examples that adjust WiFi scanning parameters, memory allocation, or timing without fixing actual vulnerabilities. While extended scan times could theoretically enable enhanced reconnaissance (as detailed in my security analysis), the commit itself is not fixing a security vulnerability - it's implementing a feature enhancement that happens to have security implications. CVEs are assigned for vulnerability **fixes**, not for feature changes that introduce new security considerations.
21b0dc55bed6d driver core: faux: only create the device if probe() succeeds
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is not a security fix and does not require a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is an API improvement to the faux device subsystem that makes the interface cleaner and more robust by ensuring proper error handling. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - Lines 152-161: Added a check after `device_add()` to verify if `dev->driver` is set (indicating successful probe) - If probe failed (`!dev->driver`), the device is torn down and NULL is returned - This prevents the creation of devices in an inconsistent state 3. **No security vulnerability fixed**: - This doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, race conditions, or privilege escalation - No sensitive components (memory management, access control) are affected in a security-relevant way - The commit message indicates this is a usability improvement ("makes the use of a custom probe() callback for a faux device much simpler overall") 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar to commit 3 (device_set_driver helper) which was marked "NO" - both are driver core infrastructure improvements - Unlike commits 1, 2, and 5 which were marked "YES" and dealt with actual error handling fixes that could lead to crashes or undefined behavior 5. **Impact**: This change prevents API misuse and improves robustness, but doesn't fix an existing vulnerability that could be exploited for security purposes. The change improves the API's reliability but is fundamentally a code quality and usability enhancement rather than a security fix.
784e6abd99f24 selftests/net: have `gro.sh -t` return a correct exit code
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is purely a test infrastructure improvement that fixes incorrect exit code handling in a selftest script. The change adds proper exit code propagation when running individual tests with the `-t` flag. 2. **No security implications**: The change only affects testing infrastructure, not kernel functionality. It modifies lines 100-105 in `tools/testing/selftests/net/gro.sh` to capture and properly return the exit code from `run_test()` instead of always returning 0. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: This aligns perfectly with the "NO CVE" examples provided: - Similar to the udpgro.sh exit code fix (Similar Commit 1) - Similar to the HID selftest exit code fix (Similar Commit 2) - Similar to the cow.c error handling fix (Similar Commit 3) 4. **No kernel code affected**: The changes are entirely within test scripts (`tools/testing/selftests/`) and don't modify any kernel functionality, drivers, or security-sensitive code. 5. **Impact scope**: This only affects the return value of test scripts, making them more reliable for automated testing. It doesn't fix any vulnerability that could be exploited or cause system compromise. The commit is a quality-of-life improvement for developers and CI systems to properly detect test failures, but has zero security impact on the kernel itself.
b5d7b2f04ebcf net/mlx5: Avoid report two health errors on same syndrome
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** This commit fixes a logic bug in the MLX5 network driver's health monitoring system. The issue is: 1. **The Problem**: When the health counter stops incrementing (indicating firmware issues), the `miss_counter` reaches `MAX_MISSES` (3) and triggers a health report via `queue_work(health->wq, &health->report_work)`. 2. **Duplicate Reports**: In the same polling cycle, if a syndrome is also detected (`health->synd != prev_synd`), another health report is triggered, causing duplicate reports for the same underlying issue. 3. **The Fix**: The commit adds `health->synd = ioread8(&h->synd);` when `MAX_MISSES` is reached, marking the syndrome as "known" so the subsequent syndrome check (`health->synd != prev_synd`) won't trigger a duplicate report. **Security Assessment:** This is **not a security vulnerability**. The change is purely about: - Avoiding duplicate health reports in logging/monitoring - Improving the driver's internal state management - Preventing redundant devlink health notifications The fix does not: - Address any memory safety issues - Fix access control problems - Prevent privilege escalation - Address input validation issues - Fix race conditions that could be exploited - Resolve any attack vectors This is a quality-of-life improvement for debugging and monitoring, not a security fix. **NO** This commit addresses duplicate health reporting in the MLX5 driver's health monitoring system. It's a logic improvement to prevent redundant devlink health reports when both miss counter threshold and syndrome detection occur in the same polling cycle. No security vulnerability is being fixed.
8c0aff7d92e2b drm/xe/pf: Create a link between PF and VF devices
- [sasha] <thinking> Let me analyze this commit carefully to determine if it should be assigned a CVE. **Commit Analysis:** **Subject:** "drm/xe/pf: Create a link between PF and VF devices" **What the commit does:** The commit creates device links between Physical Function (PF) and Virtual Function (VF) devices in the Intel Xe GPU driver's SR-IOV implementation. The main purpose is to ensure proper resume order during system resume - the PF must complete VF provisioning before VFs can resume. **Key changes:** 1. Adds a new function `xe_pci_pf_get_vf_dev()` to get VF PCI device references 2. Adds a new function `pf_link_vfs()` that creates device links between PF and VF devices using `device_link_add()` 3. Calls `pf_link_vfs()` in `pf_enable_vfs()` after enabling SR-IOV **Security Analysis:** Let me check if this introduces any security vulnerabilities: 1. **Does it fix a security vulnerability?** - No, this doesn't appear to fix an existing security issue. It's adding new functionality to manage device resume ordering. 2. **Does it introduce security vulnerabilities?** - The code adds device link creation between PF and VF devices - Uses `pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()` to get VF device references - Uses `device_link_add()` with `DL_FLAG_AUTOREMOVE_CONSUMER` flag - Proper error handling with early exit if VF device not found - Uses `pci_dev_put()` to release references 3. **Are there sensitive components affected?** - This affects SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) functionality - SR-IOV is used for hardware virtualization and isolation between VFs - Device links affect power management and resume ordering 4. **Potential security concerns:** - Device enumeration and reference handling could potentially be exploited - The code iterates through VF devices and creates links - Error handling appears robust with early exit on failure - Uses proper reference counting with `pci_dev_put()` 5. **Code quality and safety:** - The code includes proper assertions (`xe_assert`) - Has error handling for when VF devices can't be found - Uses proper PCI reference counting - The device link creation failure is non-fatal and continues with other VFs 6. **Comparison with similar commits:** Looking at the similar commits provided: - The "NO CVE" commits are mostly simple bug fixes, typo corrections, or adding debug messages - The "YES CVE" commits (Similar Commit 3 & 4) involve UAF (Use After Free) vulnerabilities in fence handling with race conditions and memory safety issues **Assessment:** This commit: - Is adding new functionality, not fixing an existing security bug - Deals with device management and power management ordering - Has proper error handling and reference counting - Doesn't involve memory safety issues, race conditions, or access control bypasses - The changes are in device link management, which is a well-established kernel mechanism - No indication in commit message of security implications - The functionality is about ensuring proper resume ordering, which is a reliability/functionality issue, not a security issue The commit appears to be a feature addition for proper device management rather than a security fix. The code follows proper kernel patterns for device reference handling and error management. Based on the analysis, this does not appear to be a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment. </thinking> NO This commit adds new functionality for device link management between PF and VF devices to ensure proper resume ordering, rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The code changes involve: 1. **Device enumeration and linking**: The new `pf_link_vfs()` function creates parent-child device links using the standard kernel `device_link_add()` API with proper error handling. 2. **Proper resource management**: The code correctly uses `pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot()` and `pci_dev_put()` for PCI device reference counting, preventing resource leaks. 3. **Robust error handling**: When VF devices cannot be found, the code properly aborts with appropriate logging rather than continuing unsafely. 4. **Non-security functionality**: The purpose is to solve a device resume ordering issue (reliability/functionality), not address any security vulnerability like memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypasses. Comparing to the similar commits, the CVE-worthy ones (Similar Commits 3 & 4) involved Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities with race conditions and missing memory barriers - serious memory safety issues. This commit involves standard device management operations with proper reference counting and doesn't exhibit any of the security-critical patterns seen in the CVE commits. The commit enhances SR-IOV device management reliability but does not introduce or fix security vulnerabilities.
1b9366c601039 drm/amdkfd: KFD release_work possible circular locking
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the broader context of the AMD KFD subsystem, I can now make an informed assessment. **NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a circular locking dependency in the AMD KFD driver, but it does **not** warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Preventive Fix, Not Exploitable Vulnerability**: The commit moves `flush_workqueue(kfd_process_wq)` outside the `kfd_process_mutex` lock to prevent a potential circular locking scenario. This is a preventive measure rather than fixing an actively exploitable vulnerability. 2. **No Demonstrated Security Impact**: While circular locking can theoretically cause system deadlock/DoS, the commit message and code changes show this is addressing a lock ordering issue that was detected by kernel lock debugging tools (WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected), not an actual security exploit. 3. **Driver Robustness Issue**: This falls into the category of driver stability and robustness improvements rather than security vulnerabilities. The locking dependency could cause hangs but doesn't demonstrate privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-critical impacts. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples provided: - Similar commits 1, 2, 3 (all marked "CVE Status: NO") are also circular locking fixes in AMD GPU drivers - Commits 4 and 5 (marked "CVE Status: YES") involved debugfs interface issues with actual deadlock exploitation potential affecting user-space interactions 5. **Limited Attack Surface**: This specific issue involves internal kernel workqueue management during process creation/cleanup, not a user-triggerable interface that could be reliably exploited. The fix improves system stability by ensuring proper lock ordering, but lacks the demonstrated security impact typically required for CVE assignment in GPU driver locking issues.
ba757a65d2a28 drm/xe/vf: Retry sending MMIO request to GUC on timeout error
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see that `xe_mmio_wait32` returns `-ETIMEDOUT` when it times out (line showing `int ret = -ETIMEDOUT;`). This confirms that the code change is checking specifically for `-ETIMEDOUT` errors. Let me analyze the security implications: **NO** This commit does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **No Security Fix**: The commit adds retry logic for MMIO communication timeouts between VF (Virtual Function) and GuC (Graphics Micro Controller) during suspend/resume operations. This is a reliability improvement, not a security fix. 2. **Timeout Handling**: The code changes only retry when `xe_guc_mmio_send()` returns `-ETIMEDOUT` (line 59-60 in the new code: `if (!err || err != -ETIMEDOUT) break;`). This is purely for handling timing issues during VF resume operations. 3. **Race Condition Context**: The commit message explains this addresses a legitimate race condition where VFs may resume before PF (Physical Function) completes GuC reset and provisioning, especially with large numbers of VFs. This is an expected operational scenario, not a security vulnerability. 4. **Bounded Retry Logic**: The retry mechanism is limited to `GUC_RESET_VF_STATE_RETRY_MAX` (10) attempts, preventing infinite loops or resource exhaustion. 5. **No Privilege Escalation**: The change operates within the same privilege context and doesn't affect access controls, memory boundaries, or security boundaries. 6. **Similar Patterns**: Comparing to the provided similar commits, this matches the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are reliability improvements (like the GuC PC retry logic in similar commits 1 and 3) rather than security fixes. The commit improves system reliability during virtualization scenarios but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
cc0aac7ca17e0 firmware: arm_ffa: Set dma_mask for ffa devices
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Type of Issue**: This is a configuration/initialization issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit adds a missing DMA mask initialization (`dev->dma_mask = &dev->coherent_dma_mask`) to prevent a warning when DMA allocation functions are called. 2. **No Security Impact**: - The warning at `kernel/dma/mapping.c:597` (`WARN_ON_ONCE(!dev->coherent_dma_mask)`) is a debugging aid to catch improper DMA configuration - Missing DMA mask doesn't create a security vulnerability - it prevents DMA operations from working properly but doesn't introduce exploitable conditions - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or access control bypasses are involved 3. **Functional Fix**: This is purely a functional correctness fix to enable proper DMA operations for FFA devices. Without this fix, DMA allocations would fail with a warning, but this doesn't create security exposure. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 & 4: Refactoring/bug fixes marked as NO - Similar Commits 2 & 3: DMA mapping error handling fixes marked as YES, but those involved improper error checking that could lead to use of invalid DMA addresses - Similar Commit 5: DMA device fix marked as NO This commit is most similar to the "NO" commits as it's a straightforward configuration fix without security implications.
25a98c7270156 PCI: brcmstb: Expand inbound window size up to 64GB
- [sasha] Now let me understand what changed and what the security implications are: Based on my analysis of the commit, here's what I found: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit modifies the `brcm_pcie_encode_ibar_size()` function to expand the maximum supported inbound window size from 32GB (log2_in <= 35) to 64GB (log2_in <= 36). This change increases the upper bound by one bit. 2. **Hardware capability expansion**: The commit message explicitly states this is to support the BCM2712 memory map that can handle up to 64GB of system memory. This is expanding hardware capability to match what the hardware can actually support. 3. **Safe for existing hardware**: The commit message notes "The change is safe for the currently supported SoCs that have smaller inbound window sizes." This indicates backward compatibility is maintained. 4. **No security vulnerability fixed**: This is a capability enhancement, not a security fix. The function still: - Validates input ranges properly - Returns 0 (disable) for invalid inputs - Maintains the same logic structure 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" are hardware capability improvements or configuration changes without security implications, which matches this commit's pattern. The change from `<= 35` to `<= 36` in line 320 simply allows one additional bit of address space, expanding from 2^35 bytes (32GB) to 2^36 bytes (64GB). This is a straightforward hardware capability expansion with proper bounds checking maintained.
d2d9c9b8de725 wifi: ath12k: Report proper tx completion status to mac80211
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Assessment **Primary Issue:** This is a mesh network performance fix, not a security vulnerability fix. **Code Analysis:** The commit moves `HAL_WBM_REL_HTT_TX_COMP_STATUS_DROP` and `HAL_WBM_REL_HTT_TX_COMP_STATUS_TTL` from the successful transmission reporting path to the internal drop path. Instead of calling `ath12k_dp_tx_htt_tx_complete_buf()` (which reports status to mac80211), these status codes now call `ath12k_dp_tx_free_txbuf()` (which silently frees the packet). **Why No CVE:** 1. **No Memory Safety Issues:** Both code paths properly handle memory management - DMA unmapping and buffer freeing occur correctly in both cases. 2. **No Information Disclosure:** No sensitive data is leaked. The change only affects whether packet status is reported to upper layers. 3. **No Privilege Escalation:** The fix doesn't affect authentication, authorization, or access controls. 4. **Performance/Correctness Fix:** The commit message explicitly states this prevents "mpath broken issue due to increase in mpath fail average" in mesh networks - a routing performance problem, not a security issue. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits:** Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: YES" involved actual memory management issues (double-free vulnerabilities). This commit has no such issues. **Mesh Network Context:** The issue was that firmware-internal drops were being incorrectly reported as transmission failures, causing mesh routing algorithms to make suboptimal path selections. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. This aligns with similar commits in the reference list that address WiFi driver functionality without security implications (marked "CVE Status: NO").
2294059118c55 PCI: brcmstb: Add a softdep to MIP MSI-X driver
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and understanding of the driver behavior, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Module Loading Race, Not Security Issue**: The commit fixes a race condition between the brcmstb PCIe driver and the MIP MSI-X interrupt controller when both are built as modules. This is a reliability/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **No Security Impact**: The race condition only affects whether the PCIe controller initializes properly. If the MIP driver isn't loaded first, the brcmstb driver's probe may fail, but this: - Does not create memory corruption - Does not expose sensitive data - Does not allow privilege escalation - Does not create exploitable conditions 3. **Simple Solution**: The fix adds `MODULE_SOFTDEP("pre: irq_bcm2712_mip")` to ensure proper module loading order. This is a standard kernel technique for managing module dependencies. 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, all commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar driver fixes that improve functionality/reliability without addressing security vulnerabilities. This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **No Mention of Security Concerns**: The commit message describes this as a "race in probing" and focuses on ensuring correct initialization order, with no indication of security implications. The change is purely a reliability improvement to ensure proper driver initialization order when built as modules.
a06398687065e soc: apple: rtkit: Implement OSLog buffers properly
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, including the additional context from the kernel tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Feature Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is implementing functionality that "has never been actually used on any supported firmware" previously. The old logic was a placeholder that just sent acknowledgments without actually implementing OSLog buffers. 2. **New Functionality Required**: Starting with firmware 13.3, OSLog buffers became necessary for MTP and AOP functionality to work. This is implementing new required functionality rather than fixing a vulnerability in existing code. 3. **No Security Vulnerability Pattern**: The changes don't exhibit patterns typical of security fixes: - No buffer overflow fixes - No access control changes - No input validation improvements for existing functionality - No privilege escalation fixes - No memory corruption fixes 4. **Implementation vs. Fix**: The code changes show a complete reimplementation of OSLog buffer handling with proper: - Field parsing (`APPLE_RTKIT_OSLOG_SIZE`, `APPLE_RTKIT_OSLOG_IOVA`) - Buffer allocation and cleanup - Protocol-specific handling (different bit layouts than SYSLOG) 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This most closely resembles the "NO CVE" reference commits that add new functionality or fix non-security bugs, rather than the "YES CVE" commit that fixed a buffer overflow/memory corruption issue. The commit adds missing functionality needed for newer firmware versions rather than fixing a security vulnerability in existing code.
22af2fac88fa5 soc: apple: rtkit: Use high prio work queue
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to make my security analysis. Based on the commit, code analysis, and understanding of RTKit's purpose, here's my assessment: **NO** ## Analysis This commit changes the work queue priority from default to `WQ_HIGHPRI` in the Apple RTKit driver. Here's why this does **not** warrant a CVE: ### Nature of the Change: - **Performance optimization only**: The commit only adds the `WQ_HIGHPRI` flag to an existing `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` call - **No security boundaries affected**: Work queue priority is a scheduling parameter, not a security control - **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is to prevent user space CPU load from increasing latency, not fixing a security issue ### Analysis of Security Impact: 1. **No memory safety issues**: The change doesn't affect memory management, buffer handling, or pointer operations 2. **No access control changes**: RTKit's security model (using SART for DMA access control) remains unchanged 3. **No privilege escalation risk**: Work queue priority changes don't grant additional system privileges 4. **No race condition fixes**: The ordered workqueue was already preventing race conditions ### Context from Similar Commits: - **Similar Commit 1** (mac80211 softirq fix): Had actual locking/synchronization issues → NO CVE - **Similar Commit 3** (devlink reload timing): Fixed race conditions in device state → NO CVE - **Similar Commit 4** (ath11k beacon work queue): Fixed "sleeping in atomic context" bug → YES CVE (actual bug fix) ### RTKit Purpose and Risk Assessment: While RTKit handles time-critical communication with co-processors (NVMe storage, future DCP display), the priority change: - Improves responsiveness but doesn't fix an exploitable condition - Doesn't change the security model or trust boundaries - Is a quality-of-service improvement, not a security fix The commit addresses a performance issue where high user space CPU load could delay RTKit message processing enough to miss display vsync timing, but this represents a denial-of-service from the user's own processes rather than an exploitable security vulnerability.
bc4722c3598d0 ARM: at91: pm: fix at91_suspend_finish for ZQ calibration
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a hardware-specific bug in DDR PHY calibration for AT91 processors, but it does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment. The analysis shows: 1. **Hardware calibration fix**: The commit corrects incorrect gray code values used in DDR impedance calibration logic during suspend/resume operations for sama7g5 and sama7d65 processors. 2. **No security implications**: The code changes: - Replace incorrect `modified_gray_code[]` array with corrected `modified_fix_code[]` values - Add proper bit shifting (`<< DDR3PHY_ZQ0SR0_*_OFF`) that was missing in the original implementation - Fix a hardware-specific calibration algorithm bug 3. **Functional fix, not security**: This addresses a "ZQ calibrate error" that prevents proper DDR impedance recalibration during boot after suspend, which is a hardware functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability. 4. **Similar pattern to reference commits**: Like the provided examples (regulator voltage fixes, GPIO number corrections, chip ID timing fixes), this is a hardware configuration/timing fix that ensures proper operation but doesn't address exploitable security flaws. The commit fixes incorrect hardware calibration values and missing bit operations, but doesn't address memory corruption, privilege escalation, buffer overflows, or other security-relevant vulnerabilities.
04bd15c4cbc3f perf: arm_pmuv3: Call kvm_vcpu_pmu_resync_el0() before enabling counters
- [sasha] Now I'll analyze the commit based on the code examination: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** The commit moves the call to `kvm_vcpu_pmu_resync_el0()` from after PMU counter enablement to before it in the `armv8pmu_start()` function. Based on my examination of the code: 1. **Function Purpose**: `kvm_vcpu_pmu_resync_el0()` (lines 199-211 in `/arch/arm64/kvm/pmu.c`) is a KVM function that ensures proper PMU state synchronization between host and guest contexts. It only operates during interrupts on VHE systems and makes a request to resync PMU EL0 state. 2. **Change Nature**: This is purely an optimization/correctness fix to avoid counting PMU setup events. The commit message explicitly states: "Counting events related to setup of the PMU is not desired, but kvm_vcpu_pmu_resync_el0() is called just after the PMU counters have been enabled." 3. **Security Assessment**: - No memory management vulnerabilities introduced or fixed - No access control changes - No privilege escalation implications - No input validation changes - No race condition fixes - The function itself only makes a KVM request and doesn't directly manipulate sensitive state 4. **Similar Patterns**: This matches the pattern of Similar Commits 1 and 2, which were performance/correctness optimizations around PMU counter management and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". The change is a timing optimization to ensure accurate PMU event counting by avoiding measurement of PMU setup overhead, not a security vulnerability fix.
9fee7d19bab63 hwmon: (gpio-fan) Add missing mutex locks
- [sasha] **Analysis:** **NO** This commit fixes a race condition in the GPIO fan driver but does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit adds missing mutex locks around calls to `set_fan_speed()` in several contexts (thermal cooling device, suspend/resume, device shutdown). The function comment clearly states it "Must be called with fan_data->lock held, except during initialization." 2. **Impact Assessment**: The race condition affects: - GPIO state updates (`__set_fan_ctrl()`) - Fan speed index updates (`fan_data->speed_index`) While this is a concurrency bug, the impact is limited to: - Potential inconsistent fan speed settings - Brief GPIO state inconsistencies - No memory corruption or privilege escalation 3. **Security Implications**: Unlike the CVE-marked similar commit (mlxreg-fan thermal statistics bug), this fix: - Does not involve buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access - Does not affect kernel memory safety - Only impacts hardware control logic, not security boundaries - Cannot lead to privilege escalation or system compromise 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - The CVE-marked commit fixed a KASAN-detected out-of-bounds access - The non-CVE commits were simple hardware control fixes - This commit falls into the hardware control category 5. **Hardware Control Context**: This is a hardware monitoring driver for fan control - the race condition affects device functionality but not system security or integrity. The fix ensures proper synchronization for hardware control operations but does not address a security vulnerability that could compromise system security or enable privilege escalation.
0ea627381eb52 hwmon: (acpi_power_meter) Fix the fake power alarm reporting
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze what this function does and what the security implications are: **NO** This commit fixes a reporting bug in the ACPI power meter hwmon driver but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit fixes incorrect power alarm reporting where stale `power_alarm` values were being returned to userspace instead of current alarm state based on actual power vs. cap comparisons. 2. **No security impact**: This is purely a functional correctness issue in a hardware monitoring interface. The bug causes: - Incorrect alarm status reporting to userspace - Users seeing "fake" power alarms when power capping is no longer active - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access control bypass 3. **Limited impact scope**: The issue affects only the accuracy of power alarm status reporting through sysfs attributes. There's no indication this could be exploited for: - Buffer overflows or memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Unauthorized access to system resources - Information disclosure of sensitive data 4. **Similar patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), this follows the same pattern as other hwmon/power supply fixes that address functional bugs without security implications. The fix simply ensures the `power_alarm` state is correctly updated and reported based on current power measurements rather than stale cached values, which is a typical driver correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability.
98fdaeb296f51 x86/bugs: Make spectre user default depend on MITIGATION_SPECTRE_V2
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a configuration consistency fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit changes the default behavior to respect the `CONFIG_MITIGATION_SPECTRE_V2` configuration option. 2. **Security implications**: - When `CONFIG_MITIGATION_SPECTRE_V2=n`, the commit changes the default from `SPECTRE_V2_USER_CMD_AUTO` to `SPECTRE_V2_USER_CMD_NONE` - This means that when Spectre v2 mitigations are intentionally disabled at build time, user-space mitigations will also be disabled by default (instead of being enabled) - However, users can still explicitly enable mitigations via command line parameters 3. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is about making the configuration consistent and giving users "flexibility to opt-in for specific mitigations independently." It's not fixing a security flaw but rather a configuration logic inconsistency. 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked as "CVE Status: NO") are also configuration and mitigation management changes, not vulnerability fixes. This commit follows the same pattern. 5. **Impact assessment**: This change doesn't expose systems to new vulnerabilities - it simply makes the default behavior consistent with the build-time configuration choice. If an administrator builds with `CONFIG_MITIGATION_SPECTRE_V2=n`, they are intentionally disabling Spectre v2 mitigations, and this change ensures user-space mitigations also respect that choice by default. The change is purely about configuration consistency and user control, not about fixing a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
e8195f0630f1c PM: sleep: Suppress sleeping parent warning in special case
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is purely a cosmetic/logging improvement that suppresses a false positive warning message. The warning "parent %s should not be sleeping" appears when USB devices are being added during resume, but this is actually legitimate behavior in the specific case being fixed. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The change only affects when the `power.is_prepared` flag is cleared for devices with `power.no_pm_callbacks` set. This is a state management optimization that allows child devices to be added without triggering spurious warnings. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, access control bypass, or other security-relevant behavior. 3. **Limited scope**: The change only affects devices that have both `power.direct_complete` and `power.no_pm_callbacks` set. These are devices that have no PM callbacks and use direct completion during resume. The change simply clears the `is_prepared` flag earlier to prevent warning messages when legitimate child device additions occur. 4. **Similar precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this follows the same pattern as other PM subsystem fixes that adjust timing or suppress false warnings - none of which received CVEs. 5. **Code analysis**: The change adds 7 lines that conditionally clear a boolean flag earlier in the resume process. This doesn't introduce any new attack vectors, memory safety issues, or alter security-relevant control flow. This is a quality-of-life improvement to remove noisy warnings, not a security fix.
06a61b5cb6a86 clk: imx8mp: inform CCF of maximum frequency of clocks
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis: **What this commit does:** - Adds proactive hardware protection by implementing maximum frequency constraints for i.MX8MP clocks - Uses `clk_hw_set_rate_range()` to inform the Common Clock Framework of safe operating limits - Prevents clocks from being configured beyond datasheet specifications **Why it's not a security vulnerability fix:** 1. **Preventive feature, not a fix**: The commit message states this is to prevent "difficult to debug issues" but doesn't indicate it's fixing an existing vulnerability 2. **Hardware protection mechanism**: This is adding safety constraints to prevent hardware damage/instability, similar to thermal throttling 3. **No indication of exploitability**: The code changes show constraint tables and range setting - there's no evidence of fixing buffer overflows, access control bypasses, or other security-relevant patterns 4. **Similar to reference commits**: Like the other "NO CVE" examples provided, this adds functionality/constraints rather than fixing a security issue **Code evidence:** - The changes add constraint tables (`imx8mp_clock_*_constraints[]`) with maximum frequency values - Calls `clk_hw_set_rate_range()` to set hardware limits - Reads device tree property `fsl,operating-mode` to determine constraint set - No security-sensitive components (memory management, access control, etc.) are modified This is hardware reliability engineering, not a security vulnerability fix.
9109a0b4cb10f media: uvcvideo: Handle uvc menu translation inside uvc_get_le_value
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit carefully based on the code changes shown and the context: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is a code refactoring/cleanup commit that moves menu translation logic from one location to another within the same driver. Specifically, it moves the V4L2 menu translation logic from `__uvc_ctrl_get_value()` into `uvc_get_le_value()`. 2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The changes show: - Removal of the `__uvc_ctrl_get_value()` function that handled menu translation - Addition of `uvc_menu_to_v4l2_menu()` helper function - Integration of menu translation directly into `uvc_get_le_value()` - Simplification of code paths by eliminating duplicate translation logic 3. **Functionality Preserved**: The commit message explicitly states this is about consolidating menu translation logic that was previously happening "in two different places" into a single location. The actual translation logic appears unchanged - it's just moved and consolidated. 4. **No Input Validation Issues**: Unlike Similar Commit 3 which was marked CVE:YES for an OOB read issue, this commit doesn't introduce or fix any bounds checking, buffer overflow, or input validation problems. 5. **No Security-Related Patterns**: The changes don't show any of the security vulnerability patterns like: - Buffer overflow fixes - Access control changes - Input validation improvements - Memory leak fixes - Race condition fixes 6. **Code Quality Improvement**: This appears to be a standard refactoring to improve code maintainability by eliminating code duplication and centralizing menu translation logic. The commit is a straightforward code reorganization that consolidates existing functionality without changing the security profile of the code.
603f9be21c189 ublk: complete command synchronously on error
- [sasha] **NO** While this commit addresses important race condition and completion handling issues in the ublk driver, it does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment. **Analysis:** 1. **Code Change Nature**: The commit changes error handling from asynchronous (`io_uring_cmd_done()` + `-EIOCBQUEUED`) to synchronous (direct error return) completion. This is a correctness and performance improvement rather than a security fix. 2. **No Security Impact**: The commit message and code changes focus on: - Avoiding unnecessary `io_uring_cmd_del_cancelable()` calls - Preventing deferred completion to task work - Improving performance by using proper synchronous semantics 3. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits**: Looking at the similar commits that received CVE status: - They fixed actual race conditions causing kernel crashes - They addressed use-after-free vulnerabilities - They had explicit security implications in commit messages - This commit focuses on proper API usage and performance 4. **Technical Assessment**: The change from `io_uring_cmd_done()` + return `-EIOCBQUEUED` to direct return of error codes is an API usage correction, not a security fix. The original code worked but was inefficient and semantically incorrect. 5. **Missing Security Indicators**: No mention of crashes, race conditions, memory corruption, or other security-relevant issues in the commit message. This is a code quality and performance improvement that makes the error handling more efficient and semantically correct, but does not address a security vulnerability.
990262fdfce24 media: uvcvideo: Add sanity check to uvc_ioctl_xu_ctrl_map
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE. **NO** **Explanation:** This commit adds input validation to prevent processing of invalid data types in the UVC video driver, but it does not qualify for a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Proactive Hardening, Not Vulnerability Fix**: The commit message states "Do not process unknown data types" which indicates this is a preventive measure rather than fixing an existing exploitable vulnerability. The similar commits that received CVEs (like the OOB read fix) explicitly mentioned security issues being fixed. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: While invalid data_type values could cause incorrect control processing behavior, my analysis of the code shows: - The data_type field is used primarily in conditional checks (`if (mapping->data_type == UVC_CTRL_DATA_TYPE_X)`) - Invalid values would typically result in bypassing type-specific processing rather than causing memory corruption - No direct array indexing or memory access operations use data_type as an index 3. **Input Validation Enhancement**: This is similar to Similar Commit 4, which added NULL pointer initialization to prevent invalid memory access but was marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both commits improve robustness but don't fix active security vulnerabilities. 4. **Controlled Input Source**: The `uvc_ioctl_xu_ctrl_map` function processes ioctl calls from userspace, but this requires device access permissions and doesn't represent a remote attack vector. The commit represents good defensive programming practice by validating user input at `/drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_v4l2.c:111`, but the lack of evidence for an exploitable vulnerability and the proactive nature of the fix indicate this should not receive a CVE.
5fd0268a8806d block: mark bounce buffering as incompatible with integrity
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit is a hardening/cleanup change that prevents a potentially problematic configuration rather than fixing an actual vulnerability. Here's the analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit explicitly marks bounce buffering as incompatible with integrity metadata by: - Adding a validation check in `blk_validate_integrity_limits()` that returns `-EINVAL` if both bounce buffering (`BLK_FEAT_BOUNCE_HIGH`) and integrity features are enabled - Removing the `bioset_integrity_create()` call from bounce buffer initialization since integrity is now incompatible 2. **Security context**: Block integrity metadata is used for data protection (checksums, protection information) on storage devices. The commit message states that "None of the few drivers still using the legacy block layer bounce buffering support integrity metadata," indicating this was already a theoretical rather than practical issue. 3. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this is most similar to "Similar Commit 4" which was marked as NO - it's a configuration/capability management change rather than fixing an actual vulnerability. 4. **Impact**: This prevents a configuration that could lead to undefined behavior or data corruption, but there's no evidence that this combination was actually exploitable or being used maliciously. It's a preventive measure rather than a security fix. The commit hardens the system by preventing an unsupported configuration combination, but doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability that was being exploited.
e7aae9f6d7621 drm/rockchip: vop2: Add uv swap for cluster window
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a feature enhancement that adds UV swap support for cluster windows on upcoming hardware (RK3576), not a security fix. The key evidence: 1. **Hardware enablement, not bug fix**: The commit message explicitly states this enables linear YUV support for "upcoming VOP on rk3576" and notes that the register was previously defined as 0xffffffff (invalid) on existing platforms. 2. **No security implications**: The change removes a conditional check that prevented UV swap configuration on cluster windows. UV swap is a display color channel ordering setting that affects visual output, not security-sensitive operations. 3. **Backward compatibility preserved**: The commit notes that on rk3568/rk3588 platforms where the register is still 0xffffffff, "this register will not be touched," meaning existing hardware behavior is unchanged. 4. **Similar pattern in reference commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked as CVE Status: NO) are also VOP2 driver enhancements for hardware support, register configuration, and display functionality - none address security vulnerabilities. This is a straightforward driver update to support new hardware capabilities, consistent with the pattern of non-security VOP2 commits in the reference examples.
c0ebe1cdc2cff ipv4: fib: Hold rtnl_net_lock() in ip_rt_ioctl().
- [sasha] **NO** This commit implements a proactive security improvement rather than fixing a specific vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit changes from global `rtnl_lock()` to per-namespace `rtnl_net_lock(net)` and updates corresponding device access functions. This is an architectural improvement, not a vulnerability fix. 2. **Security Enhancement vs. Vulnerability Fix**: The changes provide: - Stronger lockdep validation through hierarchical locking - Better network namespace isolation - Enhanced race condition prevention - Improved lock ordering guarantees 3. **No Immediate Exploitable Issue**: The commit message and code changes don't indicate any existing security vulnerability being patched. Instead, they implement a more robust locking model as part of a broader kernel effort to improve RTNL locking patterns. 4. **Comparison to CVE Examples**: Looking at the similar commits: - Similar Commit 2 & 4 (CVE Status: YES) fixed specific race conditions with detailed attack scenarios - Similar Commits 1, 3, 5 (CVE Status: NO) were proactive improvements without fixing exploitable vulnerabilities - This commit follows the pattern of the "NO" examples - it's a security hardening measure rather than a vulnerability fix 5. **Code Context**: The change from `__in_dev_get_rtnl()` to `__in_dev_get_rtnl_net()` and the hierarchical locking structure indicate this is part of a systematic improvement to network namespace isolation rather than addressing a specific security flaw. This represents security hardening rather than vulnerability remediation, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
2cef5b4472c60 scsi: logging: Fix scsi_logging_level bounds
- [sasha] Based on the analysis of the commit and the code structure, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a bounds checking issue for the `scsi_logging_level` sysctl parameter, but it does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Limited Impact**: The `scsi_logging_level` is an `unsigned int` variable used purely for controlling debugging/logging output levels in the SCSI subsystem. It's a bitmask where different bits control logging levels for different SCSI operations (error recovery, timeouts, scanning, etc.). 2. **No Security Vulnerability**: While the previous code allowed negative values to be written to an unsigned int variable (which would wrap to large positive values), this only affects logging verbosity. The variable is used in bitwise operations (`>>` and `&`) to extract specific logging level bits, but doesn't control any security-critical operations. 3. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This fix follows the same pattern as the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - specifically Similar Commits 1, 3, and 4, which all fix sysctl parameter bounds checking issues using `proc_dointvec_minmax` instead of `proc_dointvec`. These were not assigned CVEs because they fixed parameter validation issues without actual security implications. 4. **No Sensitive Operations**: The logging level only controls when debug messages are printed - it doesn't affect memory management, access control, privilege escalation, or any other security-sensitive kernel operations. 5. **Bounds Fix Only**: The commit simply ensures that only valid positive values (0 to INT_MAX) can be written to the sysctl, preventing the confusing behavior of negative values wrapping to large positive values. This is a quality-of-life improvement and bounds validation fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
254ba7e6032d3 ipv4: fib: Move fib_valid_key_len() to rtm_to_fib_config().
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase context, I can now provide a definitive answer: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** 1. Moves the `fib_valid_key_len()` validation function from `fib_table_insert()` and `fib_table_delete()` in `fib_trie.c` to `rtm_to_fib_config()` in `fib_frontend.c` 2. Changes some direct returns to use `goto errout` for consistent error handling 3. The validation logic itself remains functionally identical **Why this is NOT a security issue:** 1. **No validation is removed**: The same validation checks (`cfg->fc_dst_len > 32` and prefix validation) are still performed, just moved to a different location in the call path. 2. **All attack vectors remain covered**: The commit message explicitly explains that the three call paths are: - `ip_rt_ioctl()` - uses `rtentry_to_fib_config()` which calls `bad_mask()` for validation - `inet_rtm_newroute()/inet_rtm_delroute()` - now validated in `rtm_to_fib_config()` (where validation was moved) - `fib_magic()` - always passes correct values (32 or `ifa->ifa_prefixlen`, which are already validated) 3. **This is a code reorganization, not a security fix**: The commit message describes this as a cleanup to move validation to the appropriate layer (rtnetlink path) rather than having it redundantly in multiple places. 4. **The validation constants are the same**: `KEYLENGTH` is 32 bits (8 amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md ath12k_scan_dwell_time_security_analysis.md bpf_clean_live_states_loop_branches_security_analysis.md bpf_copy_verifier_state_loop_entry_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md dcn4x_cmdtable_initialization_security_analysis.md dm_req_preflush_throttle_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md i3c_svc_fifo_flush_daa_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md io_uring_sanitise_params_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rdma_core_page_size_finding_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_alignment_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md scsi_debug_tape_fixes_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md x86_percpu_alt_output_sp_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md sizeof(unsigned int)), so the bounds checking (> 32) remains identical. 5. **Similar pattern to reference commits**: This follows the pattern of the "NO CVE" commits in the examples, which are code cleanups, reorganizations, or minor fixes without security implications. The commit improves code organization by consolidating validation at the network configuration parsing layer rather than at the FIB table operation layer, but does not change the security posture of the system.
aa85822c611ae ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable PC beep passthrough for HP EliteBook 855 G7
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and additional context from the kernel tree, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Hardware-specific functionality enhancement**: The commit only enables PC beep passthrough functionality for a specific HP laptop model (EliteBook 855 G7), which is purely a feature addition to make hardware beeping work properly on this platform. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes do not address any security issue. Instead, they: - Add a new boolean flag `beep_just_power_on` to prevent writing beep control commands - Modify beep device attachment logic to bypass normal checks when this flag is set - Configure hardware-specific coefficient register (0x36) to enable PC beep passthrough 3. **Safe implementation**: The changes are contained within: - A codec-specific fixup function that only runs on matching hardware - Protected by `#ifdef CONFIG_SND_HDA_INPUT_BEEP` compile-time checks - Uses established kernel APIs without introducing new attack vectors 4. **Historical context**: Looking at the kernel history, a previous commit (c8c6ee611926) actually *disabled* PC beep passthrough on some Lenovo machines to fix audio noise issues - showing this is a well-understood, non-security-critical feature. 5. **Similar commits pattern**: All the provided similar commits are audio device quirks/fixes for LED functionality, beep configuration, etc., and none were assigned CVEs, indicating this type of hardware-specific audio enhancement is not considered security-relevant. The commit simply restores PC speaker functionality that was working in BIOS but broken after sound drivers loaded - a pure compatibility/functionality fix with no security implications.
061c991697062 perf/hw_breakpoint: Return EOPNOTSUPP for unsupported breakpoint type
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's what happened: **Original behavior**: When an unsupported breakpoint type was requested on an architecture that doesn't support it (like instruction breakpoints on PowerPC), the code would proceed to `__reserve_bp_slot()` which would return `-ENOSPC` when `hw_breakpoint_slots_cached(type)` returned 0 for unsupported types. **New behavior**: The commit adds an early check in `hw_breakpoint_event_init()` that returns `-EOPNOTSUPP` immediately if `hw_breakpoint_slots_cached(find_slot_idx(bp->attr.bp_type))` returns 0, before attempting to reserve slots. **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It only changes error code behavior for better test compatibility. The analysis shows: 1. **No security boundary crossed**: Both error codes (`-ENOSPC` vs `-EOPNOTSUPP`) are returned to userspace in the same contexts 2. **Same access control**: The check happens at the same privilege level with the same validation 3. **No exploitation vector**: The change only affects which specific error code is returned, not whether the operation is allowed/denied 4. **BPF test compatibility**: The commit message explicitly states this is to fix BPF selftest failures, not security issues 5. **Similar precedent**: The provided similar commits show error code alignment changes are typically not assigned CVEs This is a quality-of-life improvement for testing infrastructure, not a security fix.
66477c7230eb1 perf/core: Fix perf_mmap() failure path
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree, this is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a correctness issue in error handling but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** The code change is simple but important: it adds a success condition (`!ret`) before calling the `event->pmu->event_mapped()` callback. Here's what this prevents: 1. **The Issue**: Previously, if `map_range()` failed (returned non-zero), the `event_mapped` callback would still be called. This callback typically: - Updates PMU hardware state - Enables userspace access to performance counters - Updates memory management state 2. **The Fix**: The callback now only executes when both the initial setup succeeds AND `map_range()` succeeds, ensuring callbacks only run when the mmap operation fully succeeds. 3. **Why This Isn't a CVE**: - **No Privilege Escalation**: The failure is in the mmap path itself - if `map_range()` fails, the entire mmap operation fails and returns an error to userspace - **No Information Disclosure**: Failed mmap operations don't expose kernel memory or sensitive data - **Proper Error Propagation**: The function correctly returns the error from `map_range()` to userspace - **No Exploitable State**: While calling the callback on failure creates inconsistent internal state, this doesn't translate to a security boundary violation since the mmap fails 4. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits**: Unlike Similar Commit 3 and 5 which had CVE status, this fix doesn't involve: - Memory corruption or buffer overflows - Improper access control that could be exploited - State inconsistencies that lead to privilege escalation - Information leaks or use-after-free conditions This is a correctness fix that prevents internal kernel state inconsistencies when mmap operations fail, but doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability.
c0aa40f45fef8 media: imx335: Set vblank immediately
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit based on the code changes and compare with the similar commits: ## Analysis **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional improvement to the imx335 camera sensor driver, not a security fix. The commit fixes a behavioral issue where V4L2_CID_VBLANK control changes were not being applied to hardware immediately unless exposure was also changed. 2. **Media Driver Enhancement**: The change adds a new case statement for `V4L2_CID_VBLANK` in the control handler switch statement, making the vblank setting take immediate effect by calling `imx335_update_exp_gain()`. This is purely a functional enhancement for proper camera control. 3. **No Security Impact**: The code change: - Adds proper error handling for `__v4l2_ctrl_modify_range()` - Adds a new case to handle `V4L2_CID_VBLANK` immediately - Calls the same hardware update function (`imx335_update_exp_gain`) that was already being used for exposure changes 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar commits marked "NO" involve driver improvements, functional fixes, and code refactoring without security implications - The one marked "YES" involved race condition fixes with mutex locking to prevent concurrent access issues - This commit doesn't involve any concurrency, access control, memory safety, or privilege issues 5. **User-Space API Improvement**: This change improves the V4L2 control API behavior to meet user expectations (vblank changes taking immediate effect), which is a normal driver enhancement. The commit improves driver functionality by ensuring V4L2 controls work as expected, but contains no security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
80bdfbb3545b6 ublk: enforce ublks_max only for unprivileged devices
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this change. Based on my analysis: **CVE Status: NO** This commit does **not** fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** 1. Changes the `ublks_max` limit to only apply to unprivileged devices (those without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) 2. Allows privileged users (with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) to create up to `1 << MINORBITS` (1,048,576) ublk devices instead of the previous limit of 64 3. Maintains the existing 64-device limit for unprivileged users **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No privilege escalation**: The change actually makes the system *more* secure by distinguishing between privileged and unprivileged users 2. **Proper capability checking**: Users with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` already have extensive system control capabilities - allowing them to create more block devices is consistent with their privilege level 3. **DoS protection maintained**: The original DoS concern (unprivileged users creating too many devices) is still addressed - unprivileged users are still limited to 64 devices 4. **No information disclosure or memory corruption**: This is purely a policy change about resource limits, not a bug fix for memory safety or access control **Comparison to similar commits:** - Similar commits 1-2 (marked CVE: YES) fixed actual security vulnerabilities where unprivileged devices could leak kernel memory - Similar commit 3 (marked CVE: YES) fixed a buffer overflow/memory corruption issue - Similar commits 4-5 (marked CVE: NO) were feature enhancements or non-security bug fixes This commit is a policy refinement that improves the separation between privileged and unprivileged operations, rather than fixing a security flaw.
a06a868a0cd96 net: phy: nxp-c45-tja11xx: add match_phy_device to TJA1103/TJA1104
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes directly from the commit provided: **Analysis:** This commit adds device identification logic to differentiate between TJA1103 and TJA1104 PHY devices that share the same PHY ID (0x001BB010). The key changes are: 1. **Adds `nxp_c45_macsec_ability()` function**: Reads the port abilities register to check if MACsec capability is present 2. **Adds two new match functions**: - `tja1103_match_phy_device()`: Matches when PHY ID matches AND MACsec is NOT present - `tja1104_match_phy_device()`: Matches when PHY ID matches AND MACsec IS present 3. **Adds separate driver entry for TJA1104**: Creates a distinct driver registration for TJA1104 with its own match function 4. **Updates existing TJA1103 entry**: Adds the match function to properly identify TJA1103 **Security Assessment:** This commit does **NOT** fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it: - Improves device identification accuracy for two similar PHY chips - Ensures proper driver binding based on hardware capabilities (MACsec presence/absence) - Adds functionality to differentiate between variants of the same chip family - Uses existing, safe register reading mechanisms The changes are purely for correct device identification and driver binding. There are no: - Buffer overflow fixes - Memory safety improvements - Access control changes - Input validation enhancements - Race condition fixes - Privilege escalation mitigations Comparing to the similar commits provided (all marked CVE Status: NO), this follows the same pattern of hardware errata fixes and device support improvements rather than security vulnerability fixes. **NO** This commit adds device differentiation logic for TJA1103/TJA1104 PHY variants that share the same ID but have different MACsec capabilities. It's a functional improvement for proper driver binding, not a security fix.
39e912a959c19 dpll: Add an assertion to check freq_supported_num
- [sasha] Actually, let me reconsider. If `freq_supported_num` is 0, then the loops won't execute, so there's no out-of-bounds access. But there could be other issues. Let me think about the real problem: The issue is more subtle. The problem occurs because: 1. **Memory Management Inconsistency**: Without the fix, if `freq_supported` is non-NULL but `freq_supported_num` is 0: - The `memcpy` copies the pointer value from `src->freq_supported` to `dst->freq_supported` - No `kmemdup` occurs, so `dst->freq_supported` points to the original memory - When `dpll_pin_prop_free()` is called, it will call `kfree(prop->freq_supported)` on memory that was not allocated for this specific pin instance - This could lead to **double-free vulnerabilities** if the original memory gets freed elsewhere 2. **Incorrect Memory Allocation**: With the current fix, if `freq_supported_num` is 0, `kmemdup` is called with size 0, which might: - Return NULL (handled by the error check) - Return a valid but minimal allocation - The behavior depends on the kernel allocator implementation **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Prevention, not exploitation fix**: This commit adds defensive programming (WARN_ON + early return) to prevent a driver configuration error, rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. 2. **No direct exploitation path**: The issue occurs when a driver provides inconsistent parameters (`freq_supported` non-NULL but `freq_supported_num` = 0). This is a driver bug, not a security vulnerability that can be exploited by external attackers. 3. **Limited impact**: Even if the inconsistent state occurred, the loops that access `freq_supported` use `freq_supported_num` as the bound, so with `freq_supported_num` = 0, no out-of-bounds access would occur. 4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this follows the same pattern - it's a defensive robustness improvement rather than a security fix. 5. **Driver interface hardening**: This is hardening the kernel's interface with drivers to catch implementation bugs, similar to the other DPLL commits that added assertions and validation checks. The commit message explicitly states it's fixing a "broken driver" case, indicating it's preventing driver bugs rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
7ff1c88fc8968 net: ethernet: ti: cpsw_new: populate netdev of_node
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a benign enhancement that enables proper integration with the device tree framework. The change simply assigns the device tree node pointer (`slave_data->slave_node`) to the network device's `of_node` field at line 1425: ```c ndev->dev.of_node = slave_data->slave_node; ``` This is: 1. **Not a security fix** - The commit message explicitly states this is to enable `of_find_net_device_by_node()` functionality for DSA switch stacking 2. **Purely functional enhancement** - Enables device tree-based device lookup for networking stack integration 3. **No vulnerability addressed** - There are no buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, or other security concerns being fixed 4. **Consistent with similar commits** - The reference commits show identical patterns for other TI ethernet drivers (am65-cpsw-nuss, icssg_prueth) which were also not assigned CVEs 5. **Standard kernel pattern** - This is a common practice in kernel drivers to properly link devices with their device tree nodes The commit enhances functionality without addressing any security vulnerability, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
56bcc6ecff8fd eth: fbnic: Prepend TSENE FW fields with FBNIC_FW
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader kernel tree context, this is a straightforward code refactoring commit. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Pure naming/refactoring change**: The commit only renames enum constants from `FBNIC_TSENE_*` to `FBNIC_FW_TSENE_*` to maintain consistent naming conventions with other firmware fields. The numeric values (0x0, 0x1, 0x2) remain identical. 2. **No functional changes**: The code logic, data structures, memory access patterns, input validation, or security controls are completely unchanged. This is purely a cosmetic change to improve code consistency. 3. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues are being fixed - No input validation is being modified - No privilege escalation or race conditions are addressed - The thermal sensor (TSENE) functionality remains exactly the same 4. **Consistent with non-CVE examples**: This commit is very similar to the provided examples that were marked "CVE Status: NO": - Similar Commit 1: Adding bitfield.h includes and alphabetizing headers - Similar Commit 3: Fixing a typo in a comment - Similar Commit 5: Fixing a typo in field documentation 5. **Code maintainability improvement**: The change improves code maintainability by following consistent naming conventions across the codebase, where all firmware-related constants are prefixed with `FBNIC_FW_`. This is a textbook example of a non-security-relevant refactoring commit that improves code organization without affecting functionality or security.
da02f54e81db2 perf/core: Clean up perf_try_init_event()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with similar commits, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Code cleanup, not security fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is a "clean up" operation to ensure `perf_try_init_event()` doesn't leave event->pmu or event->destroy set on failure. This is defensive programming to maintain consistent state, not fixing an exploitable vulnerability. 2. **Improved error handling**: The changes restructure the error handling flow by: - Moving error checks after successful `pmu->event_init()` - Adding proper cleanup in `err_destroy` label that sets `event->destroy = NULL` - Ensuring `event->pmu = NULL` and `module_put()` on all error paths 3. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (commits 3 & 4 which fixed double-free vulnerabilities), this commit doesn't fix a memory corruption issue or other security flaw. It's preventive cleanup. 4. **Similar pattern to non-CVE commits**: This resembles the non-CVE commits (1, 2, & 5) which were also cleanup/refactoring changes to improve code structure without fixing actual vulnerabilities. 5. **No exploitation potential**: The changes ensure proper cleanup on error paths but don't address any condition that could lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security impacts. The commit improves code quality and defensive programming practices but does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
a79efc44b5143 media: cx231xx: set device_caps for 417
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel codebase context: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a missing `device_caps` field that prevents proper video device registration. Without this fix, the device registration fails with a `WARN_ON` and returns `-EINVAL`, preventing the device from being used at all. 2. **Configuration Issue, Not Security Bug**: The missing `device_caps` is a driver configuration issue introduced when the V4L2 subsystem made this field mandatory in commit 3c1350501c21. The WARN_ON is a safety check to ensure drivers properly declare their capabilities. 3. **No Exploitable Impact**: The code changes only add capability flags (`V4L2_CAP_READWRITE | V4L2_CAP_STREAMING | V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE`) that declare what the device can do. These are informational flags for userspace - they don't change security boundaries or access controls. 4. **Device Currently Disabled**: The commit message explicitly states that "417 support is disabled" currently, so this was not even a functional issue affecting users in practice. 5. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked as "NO CVE", this follows the same pattern as the AMD graphics driver commit that fixed video codec capabilities - it's a configuration correction, not a security fix. The fix prevents a kernel warning and allows proper device registration, but involves no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues.
a734a717dcfe1 drm/amdgpu: Avoid HDP flush on JPEG v5.0.1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Purpose**: This is a driver optimization/compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit explicitly states it's making JPEG v5.0.1 consistent with JPEG v4.0.3 by avoiding HDP flush operations. 2. **Nature of change**: The commit: - Changes `jpeg_v4_0_3_ring_emit_hdp_flush` from `static` to `void` (making it globally accessible) - Adds it to the header file as a function declaration - Sets `jpeg_v5_0_1` to use the same empty HDP flush function that `jpeg_v4_0_3` already uses 3. **No security implications**: - The HDP flush function in `jpeg_v4_0_3_ring_emit_hdp_flush` is intentionally empty as a workaround for hardware incompatibility when RRMT is enabled - This is applying the same harmless workaround to v5.0.1 that already exists in v4.0.3 - The commit comment confirms this is about JPEG engine access not working properly with HDP flush when RRMT is enabled 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked CVE Status: NO) deal with HDP flush optimizations and function call corrections, none of which had security implications. This is a driver compatibility fix ensuring consistent behavior across JPEG engine versions, not a security vulnerability fix.
0b9647d40ef82 drm/amdgpu: Add offset normalization in VCN v5.0.1
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my detailed analysis, this commit does **not** warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: The commit is a **code improvement and consistency fix**, not a security vulnerability fix: 1. **Code Reuse and Consistency**: The commit simply makes VCN v5.0.1 reuse the existing, proven offset normalization logic from VCN v4.0.3. This is standard code refactoring to avoid duplication. 2. **Non-Security Context**: The changes are about: - Making functions non-static to enable reuse (`vcn_v4_0_3_enc_ring_emit_*`) - Replacing generic VCN v2.0 functions with VCN v4.0.3-specific ones - Adding proper HDP flush handling (avoiding HDP flush when RRMT is enabled) 3. **No Vulnerability Language**: The commit message contains no security-related language like "fix," "vulnerability," "CVE," or "security." It uses neutral technical language about "adding" and "reusing" functionality. 4. **Proactive Enhancement**: This appears to be proactive code improvement to ensure VCN v5.0.1 has the same robust register handling as v4.0.3, rather than fixing an actively exploitable vulnerability. 5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: All the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - technical improvements, consistency fixes, and proper hardware handling without security implications. The offset normalization and HDP flush handling are existing, well-established patterns being applied consistently across VCN versions, not emergency security fixes.
a025f424af040 drm/amd/display: Fix p-state type when p-state is unsupported
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit: **NO** This commit fixes a simple state management issue in the AMD display driver's p-state handling and does not present a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The change adds a single line `pipe_ctx->p_state_type = P_STATE_UNKNOWN;` to initialize the p-state type to a known value when p-state switching is unsupported. 2. **Impact**: The issue was purely cosmetic/informational - it only affected logging and visual confirmation displays. When p-state switching was unsupported, the `p_state_type` field would retain whatever value it previously had, causing confusion in debug output. 3. **No security implications**: - This doesn't affect memory safety (no buffer overflows, memory leaks, etc.) - No access control changes - No input validation issues - No privilege escalation potential - No race conditions or other security-relevant patterns 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this is most similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which were both marked as CVE Status: NO. These commits also fixed display-related state management issues without security implications. The fix ensures proper state initialization for debugging/logging purposes but has no security impact on the system.
b74f46f3ce1e5 drm/amd/display: Request HW cursor on DCN3.2 with SubVP
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, along with the additional context from the kernel tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Functional improvement, not security fix**: The commit explicitly addresses a gaming performance issue where SubVP (Sub-Viewport) limitations force cursor composition, degrading performance. The commit message states "anything larger will force composition which is bad for gaming on DCN3.2 if the game uses a larger cursor." 2. **No security vulnerability indicators**: The code changes involve: - Adding a single check `!pipe->stream->hw_cursor_req` to disable SubVP when hardware cursor is requested - Adding `stream_update->hw_cursor_req` to the full update required conditions - These are policy/configuration changes, not security fixes 3. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the provided reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") which involve AMD display driver optimizations and functional improvements without security implications. 4. **No memory safety or privilege concerns**: The changes involve display pipeline configuration decisions rather than fixing buffer overflows, access control issues, input validation problems, or other security-relevant patterns typically warranting CVEs. 5. **Gaming performance context**: The primary motivation is allowing larger cursor sizes (up to 256x256 vs 64x64 limited by SubVP) for better gaming experience, which is a quality-of-life improvement rather than a security concern. The commit represents a display driver optimization to balance power efficiency (SubVP) against gaming performance requirements, not a security vulnerability fix.
0dfcc2bf26901 drm/amd/display: Fix DMUB reset sequence for DCN401
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a robustness issue in the DMUB (Display Microcontroller Unit Block) reset sequence but does not constitute a security vulnerability warranting a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit addresses a race condition/synchronization issue in the reset sequence of the display microcontroller, specifically preventing "memory request path desynchronization." This is a reliability and stability improvement rather than a security fix. 2. **Code Analysis**: - Removes the problematic `DMCUB_SOFT_RESET` usage from `dmub_dcn401_reset()` - Adds proper timeout handling (1 second instead of 30 iterations) - Adds `DMCUB_PWAIT_MODE_STATUS` checking to ensure no memory requests are in flight - Moves reset operations to `backdoor_load` functions where they're done more safely - Relies on PSP (Platform Security Processor) for safer reset 3. **Impact Assessment**: While memory desynchronization could potentially cause system instability or hangs, the commit message and code changes indicate this is about proper sequencing and timing rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. The affected component is a display microcontroller, and the issue appears to be operational correctness rather than a security boundary violation. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples, commits that received CVEs (like "Revert 'Use HW lock mgr for PSR1'") involved system hangs that could affect availability, but this commit is preventative - improving the reset sequence robustness before problems occur. 5. **No Security Implications**: There's no indication that the memory desynchronization could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts beyond potential system stability issues. The fix improves system reliability and prevents potential hangs, but doesn't address a security vulnerability.
c707ea82c79db drm/amd/display: Ensure DMCUB idle before reset on DCN31/DCN35
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Vulnerability Analysis ### Core Issue The commit fixes a **memory safety vulnerability** in the DMCUB (Display Microcontroller Unit Block) reset sequence that could lead to memory corruption and system instability. ### Vulnerability Details from Code Changes 1. **Race Condition in Reset Sequence**: The commit message explicitly states that "soft reset before halt finishes and there are outstanding memory transactions" can cause "out of order transactions" and "random or unexpected load/store violations." 2. **Critical Timeout Extension**: The code increases the timeout from 100 to 100,000 iterations (1000x increase): ```c - const uint32_t timeout = 100; + const uint32_t timeout = 100000; ``` This indicates the previous timeout was dangerously insufficient. 3. **Memory Interface Safety**: The commit adds proper enable bit checking and reorders reset writes: ```c + REG_GET(DMCUB_CNTL, DMCUB_ENABLE, &is_enabled); + if (is_enabled) { + REG_UPDATE(DMCUB_CNTL2, DMCUB_SOFT_RESET, 1); + REG_UPDATE(MMHUBBUB_SOFT_RESET, DMUIF_SOFT_RESET, 1); + REG_UPDATE(DMCUB_CNTL, DMCUB_ENABLE, 0); + } ``` 4. **Firmware Communication Fix**: Changes from reading SCRATCH8 to SCRATCH7: ```c - scratch = dmub->hw_funcs.get_gpint_response(dmub); + scratch = REG_READ(DMCUB_SCRATCH7); ``` ### Security Impact - **Memory Corruption**: Out-of-order memory transactions can corrupt system memory - **System Stability**: Load/store violations can cause system crashes or hangs - **Potential Privilege Escalation**: Memory corruption in kernel space GPU drivers has historically led to privilege escalation vulnerabilities ### CVE Justification This matches the pattern of similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" that fix race conditions and memory safety issues in AMD display drivers. The explicit mention of "memory interface may produce unexpected results" and "random or unexpected load/store violations" indicates a clear security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system integrity.
0584bbcf0c53c drm/amd/display: Skip checking FRL_MODE bit for PCON BW determination
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Change:** The commit removes a gating check (`if (hdmi_encoded_link_bw.bits.FRL_MODE)`) and allows bandwidth determination to proceed by directly checking the bandwidth capability bits. This is a functional fix for PCON (Protocol Converter) hardware compatibility, not a security vulnerability fix. **Why This is Not a Security Issue:** 1. **Functional Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit message clearly states this addresses "certain PCON will clear the FRL_MODE bit despite supporting the link BW indicated in the other bits." This is a hardware compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **No Security-Sensitive Operations**: The code only reads hardware capability bits and returns bandwidth values. There are no buffer operations, memory allocations, or privilege changes that could introduce security vulnerabilities. 3. **Safe Fallback Logic**: The function maintains the same bandwidth checking logic - it just removes the FRL_MODE gate. The bandwidth values are still constrained to predefined safe values (9-48 Gbps). 4. **Pattern Comparison**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - **CVE Status: YES** commits fix null pointer dereferences and memory access violations - **CVE Status: NO** commits improve mode validation and logging - This commit falls into the latter category - it's a functional improvement for hardware compatibility 5. **No Memory Safety Impact**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commits that add null pointer checks, this change doesn't affect memory safety or access control. The commit improves hardware compatibility by working around a quirk where some PCON hardware doesn't set the FRL_MODE bit correctly, but still supports the indicated bandwidth capabilities.
6ef5ccaad76d9 drm/amdgpu: Reinit FW shared flags on VCN v5.0.1
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis: 1. **Pattern Match with Non-CVE Commits**: This follows the exact same pattern as the similar VCN v4.0.3 commits provided, which were all marked "CVE Status: NO". The code extracts firmware shared memory initialization into a dedicated function and adds proper reset handling. 2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The changes address initialization robustness, not security issues. The new `vcn_v5_0_1_fw_shared_init()` function: - Checks if `fw_shared->sq.is_enabled` is already set to avoid re-initialization - Properly initializes firmware flags after device resets - Handles SRIOV scenarios correctly 3. **Functionality Enhancement**: The commit message explicitly states this is about reinitializing firmware shared flags "after a full device reset" when "shared memory region will clear out" - this is a driver reliability improvement, not a security fix. 4. **No Attack Surface**: The code changes don't introduce or fix any exploitable conditions like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, memory leaks, or access control bypasses. This is a standard driver robustness improvement that ensures proper VCN firmware initialization across reset scenarios, similar to many other non-CVE GPU driver commits.
0695c746f55c8 drm/xe: Disambiguate GMDID-based IP names
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. It's a pure code organization/cleanup change that disambiguates IP naming without affecting any security-relevant functionality. The changes involve: 1. **Structural reorganization only**: Moving the `name` field from descriptor structs to the mapping struct and updating initialization logic accordingly 2. **No functional changes**: The same hardware detection and mapping logic occurs, just with cleaner organization 3. **No security boundaries affected**: No changes to memory management, access control, input validation, or hardware interaction 4. **Cosmetic improvements**: Making IP version-to-name mapping more explicit in the source code for developer clarity This follows the pattern of the "NO CVE" reference commits which involved similar driver organization changes (PCI ID separation, platform-specific code cleanup) without security implications.
057fef20b8401 drm/amdgpu: Do not program AGP BAR regs under SRIOV in gfxhub_v1_0.c
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This commit fixes an **operational issue**, not a security vulnerability. The code change moves AGP BAR register programming inside the existing SRIOV VF check: **Before**: AGP BAR registers were programmed unconditionally, then SRIOV VF checks applied only to system aperture programming **After**: AGP BAR programming is properly gated by the same SRIOV VF check ## Why This is NOT a Security Issue 1. **No Privilege Escalation**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes "dmesg warning" - SRIOV VF already lacks write access to these registers 2. **Hardware Access Control Already in Place**: The write attempts were already being blocked at the hardware level, just generating warnings 3. **Defensive Programming**: This is a cleanup to prevent unnecessary register write attempts that were already failing 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), this follows the same pattern of SRIOV access control improvements that are operational fixes rather than security vulnerabilities ## Key Evidence from Code The critical line in `gfxhub_v1_0_init_system_aperture_regs()`: ```c if (!amdgpu_sriov_vf(adev) || adev->asic_type <= CHIP_VEGA10) { /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var Program the AGP BAR */ WREG32_SOC15_RLC(GC, 0, mmMC_VM_AGP_BASE, 0); // ... other AGP BAR writes ``` The fix simply moves the AGP BAR programming inside this existing conditional check, preventing futile write attempts that were already being rejected by the hardware. This is a **quality-of-life improvement** to reduce log noise, not a security fix.
65991ea8a6d1e remoteproc: qcom_wcnss: Handle platforms with only single power domain
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a hardware compatibility enhancement, not a security fix. The analysis shows: 1. **Purpose**: The commit improves support for MSM8974 and MSM8226 platforms that have only a single power domain (CX) instead of multiple power domains, with MX & PX handled as regulators. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Reorders pd_names arrays to put "cx" first instead of "mx" - Adds logic in `wcnss_init_pds()` to detect single power domain case via `dev->pm_domain` check - Adds corresponding cleanup logic in `wcnss_release_pds()` - Adjusts regulator handling logic to account for single power domain platforms 3. **No Security Implications**: - No memory safety issues being fixed - No access control changes - No input validation improvements - No race conditions or privilege escalation fixes - No buffer overflows or memory leaks addressed 4. **Pattern Match**: This follows the exact same pattern as the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - all handle single power domain platform compatibility in similar Qualcomm remoteproc drivers without any security implications. The commit is purely a platform compatibility improvement for proper power domain management on specific hardware variants, with no security vulnerability being addressed.
a9fc8868b350c blk-throttle: don't take carryover for prioritized processing of metadata
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Commit Analysis This is a code optimization/simplification change rather than a security fix. The commit: 1. **Removes the `tg_dispatch_in_debt()` function** that was handling carryover accounting for prioritized metadata I/O 2. **Replaces the carryover mechanism with direct charging** via `throtl_charge_bio()` 3. **Maintains the same functional behavior** - metadata I/O still gets prioritized processing ## Key Evidence Against CVE Assignment 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is an optimization: "we can support it by charging it directly without trimming slice, and the result is same with carryover." 2. **Performance Optimization Only**: The change simplifies the accounting mechanism but doesn't fix any security-related bug. Both approaches achieve the same throttling behavior. 3. **No Impact on Access Controls**: The change only affects how I/O accounting is performed for metadata operations that are already being prioritized. It doesn't change access permissions or introduce/fix privilege escalation. 4. **Functional Equivalence**: The commit author explicitly states that the result is the same between the old carryover method and the new direct charging method. 5. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Examples**: Similar to "Similar Commit 4" and "Similar Commit 5" which were performance optimizations/code improvements without security implications. ## Comparison to CVE-Assigned Commits The CVE-assigned commits in the examples fixed actual security issues: - Use-after-free vulnerabilities (Similar Commit 1) - I/O flag handling that could cause priority inversions (Similar Commits 2&3) This commit does not fix any such security vulnerability - it's purely a code simplification that maintains equivalent functionality.
b57aa47d39e94 drm/gem: Test for imported GEM buffers with helper
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of Changes**: This is a refactoring commit that introduces a new helper function `drm_gem_is_imported()` to replace direct testing of `obj->import_attach` with a more comprehensive check. 2. **Functionality Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit improves how the DRM subsystem detects imported GEM objects to handle cases where devices on serial buses (USB/I2C) don't have DMA capability. This is functionality enhancement for broader device support. 3. **No Security Impact**: The changes in `drm_gem_dumb_map_offset()` and `drm_gem_print_info()` simply replace the existing import detection logic with the new helper. The security behavior (preventing mapping of imported objects) remains identical. 4. **Follow-up Fix Required**: The fact that a follow-up commit (8260731ccad0) was needed to fix issues with this implementation suggests it was introducing new functionality rather than fixing existing security problems. 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Unlike the CVE-warranted commits in the examples (which fix use-after-free, buffer overflows, or kernel panics), this commit is purely a code organization improvement. The commit maintains existing security boundaries while improving code maintainability and device compatibility - characteristics of enhancement rather than vulnerability remediation.
694e0b7c17476 soc: mediatek: mtk-mutex: Add DPI1 SOF/EOF to MT8188 mutex tables
- [sasha] Now let me understand what this commit does by examining the nature of the changes: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit adds missing SOF (Start of Frame) and EOF (End of Frame) configuration entries for the DPI1 (Display Parallel Interface 1) component in MT8188's mutex tables. This is adding missing functionality, not fixing a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Analysis**: The changes are purely additive: - Adds `#define MT8188_MUTEX_MOD_DISP1_DPI1 38` - Adds `#define MT8188_MUTEX_SOF_DPI1 5` - Adds `#define MT8188_MUTEX_EOF_DPI1 (MT8188_MUTEX_SOF_DPI1 << 7)` - Adds mapping `[DDP_COMPONENT_DPI1] = MT8188_MUTEX_MOD_DISP1_DPI1` - Adds SOF/EOF configuration for DPI1 3. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to "unblock generation and sending of these signals to the GCE" (Graphics Command Engine). This is enabling a display output feature that was previously incomplete, not fixing a security issue. 4. **No Security Implications**: This affects display pipeline synchronization for HDMI output. There are no buffer overflows, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant patterns in the code changes. 5. **Similar Pattern**: The similar commits provided show analogous non-security display driver improvements that were correctly classified as not requiring CVEs. This is a standard feature enablement patch for display hardware support, not a security fix.
b63263555eaaf net: phylink: use pl->link_interface in phylink_expects_phy()
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit does **not** deserve a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Code Change Analysis The commit changes line 1918 in `phylink_expects_phy()` from: ```c phy_interface_mode_is_8023z(pl->link_config.interface) ``` to: ```c phy_interface_mode_is_8023z(pl->link_interface) ``` ## Why This Is Not a Security Vulnerability 1. **Functional Bug Fix, Not Security Issue**: This is a consistency fix to ensure `phylink_expects_phy()` uses the same interface field (`pl->link_interface`) as `phylink_attach_phy()` at line 2157. The commit message clearly describes this as fixing a functional issue where interface switching could block legitimate operations. 2. **No Security-Relevant Code Paths**: - `phylink_expects_phy()` is a simple boolean check used by MAC drivers to determine if they should expect a PHY - The function at line 1914-1921 has no access control, memory management, or privilege-related logic - This is purely interface mode configuration logic 3. **No Attack Surface**: The change affects internal kernel networking state consistency but doesn't: - Fix buffer overflows or memory corruption - Address privilege escalation - Resolve input validation issues - Fix race conditions or access control bypasses 4. **Matches Non-CVE Pattern**: Similar to the provided reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this is a networking subsystem configuration fix that improves functionality without addressing security vulnerabilities. The commit resolves a functional inconsistency in interface field usage that could prevent legitimate network operations, making it a reliability improvement rather than a security fix.
5da692e2262b8 dm cache: prevent BUG_ON by blocking retries on failed device resumes
- [sasha] Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this commit: **Analysis:** This commit fixes a kernel BUG_ON that occurs when attempting to resume a cache device that previously failed to load mappings. Here's the security analysis: 1. **The vulnerability**: When `dm_cache_load_mappings()` fails during the first resume attempt, it leaves the cache in a partially initialized state where `cache->sized = true` but `cache->loaded_mappings = false`. If a user attempts to resume the device again, the code tries to load mappings into a policy object that may have entries already allocated from the previous failed attempt. 2. **The BUG_ON trigger**: In `smq_load_mapping()` → `alloc_particular_entry()`, there's a `BUG_ON(e->allocated)` at line 752. This assumes that the cache block hasn't already been allocated. However, if the previous resume attempt partially allocated some entries before failing, these entries remain allocated, causing the BUG_ON to trigger on retry. 3. **Security implications**: - **Denial of Service**: The BUG_ON causes a kernel panic, completely crashing the system - **Local privilege escalation potential**: Any user with permissions to manipulate device mapper devices can trigger this panic - **System availability**: Critical for systems using dm-cache 4. **The fix**: The commit adds a `can_resume()` function that prevents retry attempts when a cache device is in the problematic state (`cache->sized && !cache->loaded_mappings`), returning `-EINVAL` instead of allowing the BUG_ON to trigger. **CVE Assessment:** Comparing to the similar commits: - Similar commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 were all assigned CVEs for dm-cache issues - This follows the same pattern: a kernel panic/crash vulnerability in dm-cache - The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user with device mapper permissions - It causes a complete system crash (denial of service) **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. It fixes a local denial of service vulnerability where a user can trigger a kernel BUG_ON panic by attempting to resume a cache device that failed to load mappings during a previous attempt. The BUG_ON at `drivers/md/dm-cache-policy-smq.c:752` (alloc_particular_entry function) crashes the system when trying to allocate an already-allocated cache entry, similar to other dm-cache vulnerabilities that have received CVEs.
b773530a34df0 media: c8sectpfe: Call of_node_put(i2c_bus) only once in c8sectpfe_probe()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a code cleanup fix that addresses proper resource management of device tree node references, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. The change moves the `of_node_put(i2c_bus)` call to occur immediately after `of_find_i2c_adapter_by_node(i2c_bus)` instead of having it in both the success and error paths. This is a refactoring that improves code structure and ensures the node reference is released exactly once, but: 1. **No security impact**: This is a resource leak fix, not a security vulnerability 2. **Code cleanup**: The commit message explicitly states this was a transformation done by Coccinelle software for code improvement 3. **Similar pattern**: This matches the "NO CVE" pattern seen in similar commits (Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, 5) which also fix device tree node reference leaks without security implications 4. **No privilege escalation or memory corruption**: The fix prevents a minor resource leak but doesn't create conditions for exploitation The change is functionally equivalent - it just consolidates duplicate `of_node_put()` calls into a single call, which is purely a code quality improvement rather than a security fix.
c0c1a6bf80e90 media: cec: use us_to_ktime() where appropriate
- [sasha] Now I have all the information I need to analyze this commit. **NO** Based on my analysis, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is primarily a code quality improvement that replaces `ns_to_ktime(usecs amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md ath12k_scan_dwell_time_security_analysis.md bpf_clean_live_states_loop_branches_security_analysis.md bpf_copy_verifier_state_loop_entry_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md dcn4x_cmdtable_initialization_security_analysis.md dm_req_preflush_throttle_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md hardware_breakpoint_security_analysis.md i3c_svc_fifo_flush_daa_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md io_uring_sanitise_params_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rdma_core_page_size_finding_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_alignment_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md scsi_debug_tape_fixes_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md vcn_v5_0_1_fw_shared_init_security_analysis.md x86_percpu_alt_output_sp_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md 1000)` with `us_to_ktime(usecs)` to improve readability and prevent potential integer overflow. 2. **Security impact analysis**: -

Even at the maximum value (10,000,000), multiplying by 1000 gives 10,000,000,000 nanoseconds, which fits comfortably in a u64 without overflow - The integer overflow scenario described would require values up to 9,999,999 microseconds, but the actual multiplication `usecs amd_dml2_dram_speed_calculation_security_analysis.md amd_ibs_cnt_mask_security_analysis.md ast_tx_detection_security_analysis.md ath12k_mac_set_key_peer_address_security_analysis.md ath12k_monitor_ring_security_analysis.md ath12k_scan_dwell_time_security_analysis.md bpf_clean_live_states_loop_branches_security_analysis.md bpf_copy_verifier_state_loop_entry_security_analysis.md bpf_struct_ops_security_analysis.md dcn401_dentist_dispclk_register_security_analysis.md dcn4x_cmdtable_initialization_security_analysis.md dm_req_preflush_throttle_security_analysis.md drm_amd_display_mcache_security_analysis.md ext4_mmap_data_loss_security_analysis.md ext4_punch_hole_nojournal_security_analysis.md hardware_breakpoint_security_analysis.md i3c_svc_fifo_flush_daa_security_analysis.md igc_xdp_optimization_security_analysis.md interrupt_handling_security_analysis.md io_uring_sanitise_params_security_analysis.md kfd_security_analysis.md lpfc_irq_leak_security_analysis.md mac80211_cooked_monitor_removal_security_analysis.md memory_hotplug_security_analysis.md mlx5_mpwrq_max_log_wqe_security_analysis.md page_pool_napi_warning_security_analysis.md qaic_sriov_bar_filtering_security_analysis.md rdma_core_page_size_finding_security_analysis.md rtw8814au_ra_info_extension_security_analysis.md rtw89_alignment_security_analysis.md rtw89_firmware_parsing_security_analysis.md rzg2l_pupd_suspend_resume_security_analysis.md scsi_debug_tape_fixes_security_analysis.md soundwire_cadence_master_security_analysis.md vcn_v5_0_1_fw_shared_init_security_analysis.md x86_percpu_alt_output_sp_security_analysis.md xe_bo_eviction_security_analysis.md xe_vf_npd_security_analysis.md ynl_external_constants_security_analysis.md zynqmp_clock_output_names_security_analysis.md 1000` would not cause problematic overflow in practice 3. **Comparing to similar commits**: - Similar Commit 3 (rtc: tps6594) was assigned CVE status because it had a real integer overflow on 32-bit systems where a long could overflow when multiplied by a large constant - This CEC commit is different because: (a) it uses u32 fields, not long, (b) there are input validation limits, and (c) the potential overflow doesn't actually occur within the validated range 4. **Attack surface**: This is part of CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) pin error injection functionality, which is primarily a debugging/testing feature with limited attack surface. The commit fixes a theoretical integer overflow issue that doesn't manifest as a practical security vulnerability due to existing input validation constraints.
2b3db788f2f61 ARM: tegra: Switch DSI-B clock parent to PLLD on Tegra114
- [sasha] Perfect! Looking at the current state of the file, I can see that both DSI-A (line 126) and DSI-B (line 142) now use `TEGRA114_CLK_PLL_D_OUT0` as their parent clock, while HDMI (line 114) uses `TEGRA114_CLK_PLL_D2_OUT0`. This confirms the commit's purpose - making the clock parent assignments consistent with the intended hardware design. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is a hardware configuration optimization that corrects clock parent assignments to match the intended design (PLLD for internal video devices like DSI, PLLD2 for HDMI). This is: 1. **Not a security fix**: The commit message describes optimization, not vulnerability remediation 2. **Device tree configuration change**: Only modifies hardware clock routing, not security-sensitive code logic 3. **Follows established patterns**: Similar to other non-CVE commits that adjust display controller clock configurations 4. **No security implications**: Clock parent selection for display controllers doesn't affect system security boundaries, memory safety, or access controls The change brings consistency to the hardware configuration but poses no security risk.
4c57930f68d90 soc: samsung: include linux/array_size.h where needed
- [sasha] Based on this analysis, I can now determine whether this commit should receive a CVE. **NO** This commit is purely a build/compilation fix that addresses missing header includes. The analysis shows: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit only adds `#include <linux/array_size.h>` statements to multiple Samsung SoC driver files. This is purely a compilation dependency fix. 2. **Build errors being fixed**: The commit message explicitly shows compilation errors where `ARRAY_SIZE` is an "undeclared identifier", indicating missing header includes rather than a functional bug. 3. **No functional code changes**: The diff shows only new include statements - no changes to actual code logic, memory handling, access control, or any security-sensitive operations. 4. **ARRAY_SIZE usage context**: The macro is used in simple for-loops to iterate over static arrays in power management configurations, which are compile-time determined and not security-sensitive. 5. **Comparison to similar commits**: This matches the pattern of similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" that fix compilation issues, header dependencies, or code organization without addressing security vulnerabilities. This is a standard maintenance commit that ensures proper header dependencies for successful compilation, with no security implications.
1d724a2f1b2c3 drm/xe: Retry BO allocation
- [sasha] Now let me also examine the changes in the commit diff more carefully and compare with similar commits to understand the security implications: Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds a retry loop to BO (Buffer Object) allocation in `xe_gem_create_ioctl()` using the existing `xe_vm_validate_should_retry()` mechanism that is already used in exec and preempt rebind workers. 2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: This is not fixing a security vulnerability. Instead, it's implementing a workaround for a limitation in TTM (Translation Table Manager) that doesn't support fair eviction via WW (Wait-Wake) locking. 3. **Bounded retry mechanism**: The retry is bounded by a timeout (`XE_VM_REBIND_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS` = 1000ms) and only retries on `-ENOMEM` errors with a 20ms sleep between attempts. This prevents infinite loops and resource exhaustion. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those that received CVE assignments (YES) were fixing actual security vulnerabilities like: - Missing locking leading to NPD (Null Pointer Dereference) and UAF (Use After Free) - Improper resource cleanup and lock management The NO examples were performance optimizations or functionality improvements without security implications. 5. **Code safety**: The retry mechanism includes proper error handling, timeout bounds, and follows the existing patterns already used elsewhere in the codebase. The commit message explicitly states this will be reverted once TTM supports fair eviction properly. This commit is a performance/reliability improvement to handle memory pressure scenarios better, not a security fix.
169b226220583 ieee802154: ca8210: Use proper setters and getters for bitwise types
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now determine the security implications of this commit. **NO** This commit fixes sparse warnings related to incorrect type usage for bitwise types (endianness annotations) in the IEEE 802.15.4 ca8210 driver. The changes are: 1. **Line 1796/1801**: Changed from `*(u16 *)&data_ind[1]` to `cpu_to_le16(get_unaligned_le16(&data_ind[1]))` for pan_id assignments 2. **Line 1448**: Changed from manual byte manipulation to `put_unaligned_le16(dst_pan_id, ...)` 3. **Line 1928**: Changed from direct assignment to `le16_to_cpu(header.dest.pan_id)` **Why this doesn't warrant a CVE:** 1. **Type annotation fix, not functional change**: The changes fix sparse warnings about bitwise type mismatches (__le16 vs u16) but don't change the actual functionality or data flow. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The original code used direct casting `*(u16 *)&data_ind[1]` which could potentially cause unaligned access issues on some architectures, but the new code uses `get_unaligned_le16()` which is the proper way to handle potentially unaligned data. However, this is a robustness improvement, not a security fix. 3. **Similar to reference commits**: This is very similar to the provided reference commits (Similar Commits 1-5) which all deal with fixing sparse warnings for bitwise type mismatches and endianness annotations. All of those were marked as "CVE Status: NO". 4. **No privilege escalation or memory corruption**: The changes don't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, or other security-relevant vulnerabilities. They ensure proper endianness handling and type safety. This is a code quality improvement that fixes compiler warnings and ensures proper type usage, not a security vulnerability fix.
dcec12617ee61 rtc: ds1307: stop disabling alarms on probe
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The change is a behavioral improvement that removes the automatic disabling of RTC alarms during device probe, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. The specific code change removes these lines: ```c regs[0] &= ~(DS1337_BIT_A2IE | DS1337_BIT_A1IE); ``` This change: 1. **Is not a security fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is about "bad practice" rather than fixing a vulnerability 2. **Improves functionality**: It preserves alarm settings across reboots instead of clearing them 3. **Does not address memory safety**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption issues 4. **Does not fix access control**: No privilege escalation or unauthorized access concerns 5. **Does not patch input validation**: No bounds checking or sanitization improvements Comparing to the reference commits: - Similar to Similar Commit 2-5 (NO CVE status): This is a functional improvement/bug fix without security implications - Unlike Similar Commit 1 (YES CVE status): That commit fixed a null pointer dereference which is a security-relevant memory safety issue The alarm interrupt enable bits (DS1337_BIT_A1IE/DS1337_BIT_A2IE) control normal RTC functionality, and their improper handling during probe does not create exploitable security conditions.
fd881d0a085fc rseq: Fix segfault on registration when rseq_cs is non-zero
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Security Vulnerability Analysis:** 1. **Memory Safety Issue**: The commit fixes a segmentation fault that can occur when the kernel doesn't properly validate the `rseq_cs` field during registration. A segfault is a memory safety issue that can potentially be exploited. 2. **Kernel-User Space Boundary Vulnerability**: The vulnerability occurs at the critical kernel-user space boundary where the kernel trusts user-provided data (`rseq_cs` pointer) without proper validation. This is a classic attack surface. 3. **Potential for Exploitation**: The commit message explicitly states "This can result in a segfault on return to user-space if the value stored in the rseq_cs field doesn't point to a valid struct rseq_cs." This indicates that user-space can trigger kernel behavior that results in crashes. 4. **Code Evidence**: The fix adds validation in lines 530-544 of the syscall path: ```c if (rseq_get_rseq_cs_ptr_val(rseq, &rseq_cs)) return -EFAULT; if (rseq_cs && clear_rseq_cs(rseq)) return -EFAULT; ``` This shows the kernel previously wasn't checking if `rseq_cs` pointed to valid memory before using it. 5. **Pattern Match with CVE-Assigned Commits**: This follows the same pattern as "Similar Commit 4" and "Similar Commit 5" which were assigned CVEs - both involved missing NULL/validation checks that could lead to crashes or memory safety issues. The fact that this is a memory safety vulnerability in a system call that can be triggered by user-space, combined with the segfault potential and the need for explicit validation fixes, makes this a clear candidate for CVE assignment.
f8ece40786c93 tcp: bring back NUMA dispersion in inet_ehash_locks_alloc()
- [sasha] NO This commit is a performance optimization that improves NUMA memory dispersion for TCP hash table spinlocks. It does not fix a security vulnerability. The changes: 1. **Use vmalloc() for better NUMA distribution**: The commit switches from kvmalloc_array() to vmalloc_array() on multi-node systems to spread spinlock allocations across NUMA nodes, which is purely a performance enhancement. 2. **Fallback mechanism preserved**: The code maintains a safe fallback to kvmalloc_array() if vmalloc_array() fails, ensuring no loss of functionality or reliability. 3. **No security implications**: The commit does not address any memory safety issues, access control problems, race conditions, or other security vulnerabilities. It's focused entirely on optimizing memory locality and reducing NUMA pressure. 4. **Similar to reference commits**: This resembles the "NO" CVE examples which are performance optimizations (like the hugetlb allocation fix and TCP performance improvements) rather than the "YES" examples which fix actual security issues like data races or memory corruption. The commit message clearly states this is for "NUMA dispersion" and performance on large systems, with test results showing memory distribution across nodes. There are no mentions of security concerns, crashes, or vulnerabilities being fixed.

2f1361f862a68 media: qcom: camss: csid: Only add TPG v4l2 ctrl if TPG hardware is available
- [sasha] Let me examine the commit without the kernel tree context and analyze it based on the provided information. Looking at this commit: **Subject**: "media: qcom: camss: csid: Only add TPG v4l2 ctrl if TPG hardware is available" **Analysis of the code changes**: 1. **Purpose**: The commit fixes a logic issue where v4l2 controls for Test Pattern Generator (TPG) were being registered even when TPG hardware doesn't exist on some SoCs. 2. **Key changes**: - Adds conditional checks for `csid->testgen.nmodes != CSID_PAYLOAD_MODE_DISABLED` before setting up v4l2 controls - Only calls `v4l2_ctrl_handler_setup()` when TPG hardware is available - Modifies format handling logic to properly handle cases when TPG is disabled - Updates registration/unregistration functions to conditionally handle TPG controls 3. **Security implications assessment**: - This is a **correctness/functionality fix**, not a security vulnerability - The issue is about improper registration of v4l2 controls when hardware doesn't support them - No memory corruption, buffer overflow, privilege escalation, or access control issues - No input validation problems or race conditions - The fix prevents potential crashes or undefined behavior when trying to use non-existent hardware features, but this appears to be a robustness improvement rather than a security issue 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - All the provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") are also hardware-specific fixes, missing error checks, or resource management improvements - This commit follows the same pattern - it's a driver correctness fix 5. **Impact assessment**: - The fix prevents potential system instability when accessing non-existent TPG hardware - However, this appears to be more about preventing driver errors rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities - No indication of potential for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a driver correctness fix that prevents registration of v4l2 controls for non-existent TPG hardware. While it may prevent crashes or undefined behavior, it doesn't address a security vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise. The changes are purely about proper hardware capability detection and conditional feature registration, which falls into the category of robustness improvements rather than security fixes.
25961bad92124 drm/amdgpu/gfx10: Add cleaner shader for GFX10.1.10
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and additional context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Not fixing a vulnerability**: This commit is adding new functionality (cleaner shader support for GFX10.1.10 GPUs) rather than fixing an existing security vulnerability. It's enabling a security feature, not patching a flaw. 2. **Security enhancement, not fix**: The cleaner shader is designed to **prevent** data leaks between GPU workloads by clearing registers and memory between executions. This is a proactive security measure, similar to the previous commits for GFX9.4.2 and other GPU versions. 3. **Pattern matches non-CVE similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Added cleaner shader for GFX9.4.2 - same pattern - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Fixed cleaner shader timing - improvement to existing feature - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Improved cleaner shader triggering - enhancement 4. **Code analysis confirms enhancement nature**: The code changes in `gfx_v10_0.c:4796-4811` show: - Adding support for IP_VERSION(10, 1, 10) - Setting cleaner shader pointer and size - Enabling the feature with proper firmware version checks - Graceful fallback if initialization fails 5. **No indication of prior vulnerability**: There's no mention in the commit message of fixing data leaks, security issues, or addressing any existing vulnerability. The language describes this as adding a new security capability. The commit follows the same pattern as other cleaner shader additions that were correctly classified as non-CVE worthy, representing a new security feature rather than a security fix.
fcf0e25ad4c8d rcu: handle unstable rdp in rcu_read_unlock_strict()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a race condition in RCU (Read-Copy-Update) implementation but does not address a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit addresses a race condition where `rcu_read_unlock_strict()` could be called with preemption enabled, making the RCU data pointer (`rdp`) unstable and creating racy access to the `norm` value. 2. **Code changes analysis**: - In `include/linux/rcupdate.h:96-100`: The order is changed so `rcu_read_unlock_strict()` is called before `preempt_enable()` instead of after - In `kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h:836`: The condition check changes from `preempt_count()` to `in_atomic_preempt_off()` to ensure proper preemption state 3. **Impact assessment**: This is a correctness/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The race condition could potentially cause: - Incorrect RCU state management - Possible system instability or crashes - But NOT memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: This resembles the "Similar Commit 2" (CVE Status: NO) which also fixed RCU locking mismatches without security implications. 5. **Security context**: RCU is a synchronization mechanism, and while critical for kernel stability, this particular race doesn't create exploitable security conditions - it's a synchronization correctness issue. The fix ensures that `rcu_read_unlock_strict()` operates with a stable RCU data pointer, preventing potential crashes or incorrect behavior, but doesn't address any exploitable security vulnerability.
ff61f380de565 PCI: Fix old_size lower bound in calculate_iosize() too
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a resource calculation bug in PCI bridge window sizing, specifically in the `calculate_iosize()` function. The issue is identical to one that was previously fixed in `calculate_memsize()` - it prevents double counting of resources by moving the `old_size` lower bound check to occur after adding `children_add_size`, rather than before. Key observations: 1. **Functionality Bug, Not Security**: This is a resource accounting/calculation error that causes incorrect PCI bridge window sizing during device remove/rescan cycles, similar to the pattern fixed in the memory calculation function. 2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes don't involve buffer overflows, memory corruption, or access control bypass. The function deals with resource size calculations using `resource_size_t` types with proper bounds checking. 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug affects PCI resource allocation logic but doesn't provide any mechanism for privilege escalation or unauthorized access. 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All five similar commits provided as reference examples (dealing with PCI setup-bus.c resource calculation fixes) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the same pattern - it's a functional correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability. 5. **Impact**: The bug causes bridge windows to grow unnecessarily large during repeated remove/rescan cycles, which is a resource management inefficiency but not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a double-counting arithmetic error in PCI resource calculation logic that has no security implications.
7e67ef889c9ab powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing #size-cells on PowerBook6,7
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, code changes, similar historical commits, and understanding of the broader context, here is my determination: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a device tree property fixup that addresses a deprecated practice warning, not a security vulnerability. The commit adds a missing `#size-cells` property to i2s nodes on PowerBook6,7 systems to prevent warnings introduced by commit 045b14ca5c36. 2. **Code Analysis**: The change is minimal and safe: - Line 2892: Updates the comment to include "i2s" nodes - Line 2896: Extends the condition to check for both "escc" AND "i2s" device types using `prom_strcmp(type, "escc") && prom_strcmp(type, "i2s")` - The logic simply adds a missing property (`#size-cells = 1`) to device tree nodes that lack it 3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 & 2: Both marked as "CVE Status: YES" but these appear to be the same PowerMac escc fix, which seems inconsistent with the pattern - Similar Commits 3, 4, 5: All marked as "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar device tree property fixes - The pattern suggests device tree property corrections are typically not security issues 4. **Security Impact**: There is no security vulnerability being fixed here: - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control issues - No privilege escalation or race conditions - Simply prevents warning messages during boot by adding a missing device tree property - This is a compatibility/cosmetic fix, not a security fix 5. **Function Context**: The `fixup_device_tree_pmac()` function is part of the PowerMac boot-time device tree fixup code in `prom_init.c:2896` that corrects malformed or incomplete device trees during early boot - this is normal maintenance, not security-related. The commit addresses a warning condition introduced by stricter device tree validation, making it purely a compatibility fix rather than a security issue.
fe2fa3be3d59b drm/amdgpu: Fix missing drain retry fault the last entry
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and context from the kernel tree, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The change modifies a timestamp comparison from `amdgpu_ih_ts_after` (strict greater than) to `amdgpu_ih_ts_after_or_equal` (greater than or equal) in the page fault handling logic. This ensures that page faults with timestamps equal to the checkpoint timestamp are also dropped during drain operations. 2. **Specific Code Change**: The fix changes line 3028 from: ```c if (amdgpu_ih_ts_after(ts, svms->checkpoint_ts[gpuidx])) ``` to: ```c if (amdgpu_ih_ts_after_or_equal(ts, svms->checkpoint_ts[gpuidx])) ``` 3. **Context and Purpose**: This is part of the SVM (Shared Virtual Memory) page fault handling mechanism in AMD's graphics driver. The checkpoint_ts is used to determine whether retry faults should be drained/dropped. The fix ensures that the "last entry" mentioned in the commit message (where timestamp equals checkpoint) is properly handled. 4. **Security Assessment**: - This is a timing/ordering fix, not a vulnerability - No memory corruption, buffer overflow, or access control issues - No privilege escalation potential - This prevents incorrect page fault processing but doesn't introduce or fix a security hole - Similar to Similar Commit 1 which was marked "NO" for race condition fixes 5. **Impact**: The bug could cause page fault recovery failures but doesn't represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously. This appears to be a correctness fix for edge case handling in the page fault draining mechanism rather than a security vulnerability.
6d4bfe6d86af1 arm64: tegra: Resize aperture for the IGX PCIe C5 slot
- [sasha] Now I can see the key difference. Let me analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** This commit modifies the PCIe configuration for the NVIDIA IGX Orin platform's C5 slot to support larger BAR (Base Address Register) apertures for graphics cards like the RTX A6000. **Key Changes:** 1. **ECAM region expansion**: Changed from `0x2b 0x30000000 0x0 0x10000000` to `0x2e 0x20000000 0x0 0x10000000` - this moves the ECAM base address from `0x2b30000000` to `0x2e20000000` 2. **Memory range expansion**: Added explicit prefetchable memory range `0xc3000000 0x28 0x00000000 0x28 0x00000000 0x6 0x20000000` (25088MB) vs the original `0x43000000 0x28 0x00000000 0x28 0x00000000 0x3 0x28000000` (12928MB) **Security Analysis:** 1. **Not a vulnerability fix**: This is a feature enhancement to support larger BAR sizes, not fixing a security issue 2. **Hardware resource allocation**: The changes expand memory apertures to accommodate graphics cards with resizable BARs 3. **No access control changes**: No changes to privilege levels, authentication, or authorization mechanisms 4. **No input validation**: No code that processes untrusted input 5. **Configuration expansion**: The commit increases available memory space rather than fixing memory corruption or access violations **Comparison with similar commits:** All the provided similar commits (marked as "CVE Status: NO") deal with similar PCIe BAR/aperture sizing issues and device tree configuration changes, none of which were assigned CVEs. **NO** This commit expands PCIe memory apertures to support larger graphics card BARs, which is a feature enhancement rather than a security fix. The changes only modify device tree memory layout configuration without addressing any vulnerability, access control issue, or potential exploitation vector.
a8c2d3932c110 ice: treat dyn_allowed only as suggestion
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the security implications, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Semantic Enhancement, Not a Fix**: The commit message describes this as an improvement to allow mixed static/dynamic allocation patterns, not a fix for a security issue. The changes are described as "treat dyn_allowed only as suggestion" to provide more flexibility. 2. **Safe Boundary Adjustments**: The mathematical changes (subtracting 1 from limits) are deliberate adjustments to make the limits inclusive rather than exclusive. Looking at the code: - `limit.max = pf->irq_tracker.num_entries - 1` makes sense because xarray indices are 0-based, so valid indices are 0 to (num_entries-1) - `num_static = pf->irq_tracker.num_static - 1` follows the same pattern for 0-based indexing 3. **Logic Inversion is Intentional**: The change from `dyn_only` (force dynamic) to `dyn_allowed` (allow dynamic but use static if available) is a planned architectural change to improve resource allocation efficiency, not a security fix. 4. **No Evidence of Security Impact**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (which had explicit null pointer checks and memory allocation fixes), this commit: - Contains no "Fixes:" tag indicating it addresses a vulnerability - Has no security-related language in the commit message - Is purely a feature enhancement for interrupt allocation strategy 5. **Well-Reviewed Enhancement**: The commit shows extensive review (Reviewed-by tags from multiple maintainers) and testing (Tested-by tag), indicating this was a planned enhancement rather than an urgent fix. 6. **Pattern Recognition**: This commit follows the pattern of the "CVE Status: NO" examples, which were code refactoring and organization changes rather than security fixes. The mathematical and logical changes, while complex, are part of a deliberate redesign of the interrupt allocation algorithm to be more flexible, not corrections of security flaws.
caa9dbb76ff52 crypto: mxs-dcp - Only set OTP_KEY bit for OTP key
- [sasha] Now I can see the complete picture. Let me analyze the security implications: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit fixes a hardware configuration issue in the i.MX DCP (Data Co-Processor) crypto driver, specifically related to key selection for protected AES (PAES) operations. Here's why this does NOT warrant a CVE: 1. **Bug Type**: This is a hardware configuration correctness bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that the `MXS_DCP_CONTROL0_OTP_KEY` bit was being set incorrectly for all hardware-referenced keys, when it should only be set for OTP (One-Time Programmable) keys specifically. 2. **Code Analysis**: The change modifies the key selection logic in `drivers/crypto/mxs-dcp.c`: - **Before**: `if (key_referenced)` → set OTP_KEY bit for ANY hardware key - **After**: `if (actx->key[0] == DCP_PAES_KEY_OTP)` → only set OTP_KEY bit for actual OTP keys 3. **Security Impact**: This fix actually IMPROVES security by ensuring correct hardware key selection. The bug was causing incorrect key types to be used, but it was not causing: - Information disclosure - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Cryptographic key leakage - Buffer overflows 4. **Context**: The commit message explicitly states this aligns with "NXP's downstream kernel fork and optee_os", indicating this is a hardware compatibility fix rather than a security issue. 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Unlike the CVE-warranted examples that fixed memory leaks, buffer issues, or synchronization problems, this commit only corrects hardware register configuration logic. The fix ensures the DCP hardware uses the intended cryptographic keys rather than potentially using the wrong hardware key slot, but this doesn't constitute a vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
074e40d9c2a84 drm/xe: Nuke VM's mapping upon close
- [sasha] cc47f07234f72 crypto: lzo - Fix compression buffer overrun
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the codebase, here is my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a critical buffer overrun vulnerability in the LZO compression implementation. Here's my analysis: **Security Vulnerability Analysis:** 1. **Buffer Overrun Fix**: The commit message explicitly states "Fix compression buffer overrun" and explains that "the compression code in LZO never checked for output overruns." This is a clear indication of a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Changes Show Security Improvements**: - The diff introduces `NEED_OP(x)` checks throughout the compression code before writing to the output buffer - Multiple `NEED_OP()` calls are added before memory operations like `COPY4()`, `COPY8()`, and direct writes to `*op++` - An `output_overrun` error handling path is added that returns `LZO_E_OUTPUT_OVERRUN` - The new `lzo1x_1_compress_safe()` functions explicitly check buffer boundaries 3. **Critical Context**: The LZO compression is used in the kernel's crypto subsystem (as seen in `/home/sasha/linux/crypto/lzo.c` line 38), making buffer overruns a serious security concern that could lead to: - Memory corruption in kernel space - Potential privilege escalation - System crashes or undefined behavior 4. **Similarity to CVE-assigned Commits**: This commit shares characteristics with the provided examples that received CVE status: - Similar to the btrfs LZO commit (CVE: YES) that fixed compressed segment length validation - Similar to the LZ4 decompress commit (CVE: YES) that fixed read out-of-bounds issues - Similar to the NTFS3 chunk decompression commit (CVE: YES) that prevented index out-of-bounds 5. **Impact Assessment**: Unlike the bunzip2 commit (CVE: NO) which was a rare edge case with symbol counting, this LZO fix addresses a fundamental missing security check that affects all compression operations. The commit transforms unsafe compression functions to safe variants with proper boundary checking, which is a textbook security fix warranting CVE assignment.
934e9d137d937 PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the vulnerability based on the code changes and commit message: ## Analysis **CVE Status: YES** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a **memory corruption vulnerability** that causes a kernel oops through a double-free scenario. Here's why this warrants a CVE: ### Security Impact: 1. **Kernel Oops/Crash**: The double-free directly causes kernel crashes, leading to system instability and potential denial of service 2. **Memory Corruption**: Double-free bugs are a well-known class of memory corruption vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited for more serious attacks 3. **Reproducible Trigger**: The vulnerability is triggered by a common hardware event (PERST# deassertion during host reboot), making it easily reproducible ### Technical Analysis: The vulnerability occurs in the PCI endpoint test driver's memory management: 1. **Root Cause**: In `pci_epf_test_set_bar()` at line 742-743, when `pci_epc_set_bar()` fails, the code calls `pci_epf_free_space()` but **does not set `epf_test->reg[bar]` to NULL** 2. **Trigger Scenario**: - During EP initialization, BARs are allocated - If `epc_set_bar()` fails (e.g., no free inbound window), memory is freed but pointer remains - On host reboot/PERST# deassertion, the same allocation failure occurs again - The code attempts to free already-freed memory → **double-free** 3. **Code Fix**: The commit adds `epf_test->reg[bar] = NULL;` after `pci_epf_free_space()` calls in both: - `pci_epf_test_set_bar()` (line 744) - `pci_epf_test_free_space()` (line 945) ### CVE Criteria Met: - **Confidentiality**: Potential (memory corruption) - **Integrity**: YES (memory corruption, kernel crash) - **Availability**: YES (denial of service through kernel oops) - **Authentication Required**: NO (triggered by hardware events) - **User Interaction**: NO (automatic on PERST# events) This is a classic memory safety vulnerability in kernel code that can cause system crashes and potentially be exploited for more serious attacks. The fix ensures proper cleanup of memory management state.
ef1a5121ae3da pinctrl: sophgo: avoid to modify untouched bit when setting cv1800 pinconf
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and understanding of the pinctrl subsystem context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Technical Analysis: The commit fixes a register handling bug where the driver was writing entire register values instead of using proper read-modify-write operations with masking. The key changes: 1. **Added mask parameter**: Functions now receive both `value` and `mask` parameters 2. **Implemented read-modify-write**: Changed from `writel(value, addr)` to: ```c reg = readl(addr); reg &= ~mask; reg |= value; writel(reg, addr); ``` ## Why This Is NOT a Security Vulnerability: 1. **Hardware Configuration Issue**: This is a hardware configuration bug that could cause pin configuration corruption, but doesn't represent a security boundary violation. 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The pinctrl subsystem requires appropriate permissions to access, and this bug doesn't change those permission requirements. 3. **No Information Disclosure**: The bug doesn't leak sensitive information - it only affects pin electrical characteristics. 4. **Functional vs Security Impact**: While the bug could cause "unexpected errors" as mentioned in the commit message, these would be functional hardware issues (wrong pin states, electrical problems) rather than security exploits. 5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Comparing with the reference commits: - Similar Commit 1 & 2: Were marked CVE=YES because they prevented "boards from crashing" - a denial of service - Similar Commit 3 & 4: Were marked CVE=NO for bounds checking and configuration fixes - This commit is more similar to commits 3-5 (configuration fixes) than the crash-preventing commits 1-2 6. **Limited Attack Surface**: Pin configuration errors typically manifest as hardware malfunctions rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities. The fix prevents register corruption that could cause functional issues, but doesn't address a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously.
7e80bbef1d697 misc: pci_endpoint_test: Give disabled BARs a distinct error code
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, code changes, and kernel context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit is purely an improvement in error handling and diagnostic capability. It changes the order of two validation checks to provide more specific error codes (-ENODATA vs -ENOMEM) for different failure scenarios. 2. **No Security Impact**: The code change only affects the return value differentiation between: - A BAR with size 0 (disabled BAR) → returns -ENODATA - A NULL test->bar[barno] pointer → returns -ENOMEM 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The original code already properly checked for NULL pointers before dereferencing. The new code adds an additional check for `bar_size` being 0 **before** the NULL check, but both checks were already preventing unsafe memory access. 4. **Purpose is Diagnostic**: The commit message explicitly states this change is "to allow the selftests to return SKIP instead of FAIL for disabled BARs" - this is purely for better test reporting, not security. 5. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked "CVE Status: NO" (commits 1, 2, and 5) are also error handling improvements, endianness fixes, and validation enhancements - none of which fixed actual security vulnerabilities. The change moves the `bar_size` check before the `test->bar[barno]` check without introducing any new security risks or fixing any existing security vulnerabilities. This is a code quality and diagnostic improvement, not a security fix.
af1451b6738ec selftests: pci_endpoint: Skip disabled BARs
- [sasha] Now let me understand what this change actually does: **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **What the commit does**: The change modifies a userspace selftest program to handle disabled BARs more gracefully. When a BAR is disabled (returns -ENODATA), the test now skips that BAR instead of failing. 2. **No security impact**: - This is purely a test framework improvement, not a fix to kernel driver code - The change only affects userspace selftest behavior, not kernel functionality - No memory safety issues, access control problems, or privilege escalation fixes - No buffer overflows, race conditions, or input validation improvements 3. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly explains this is about making tests less "pessimistic" - some endpoint controllers intentionally disable certain BARs to prevent accidental overwriting of internal registers during testing. The test was incorrectly failing in these legitimate scenarios. 4. **File location**: The modified file `tools/testing/selftests/pci_endpoint/pci_endpoint_test.c` is a userspace test program, not kernel code that could introduce security vulnerabilities. 5. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits that receive CVEs typically fix actual kernel driver bugs with security implications (like the Similar Commit 5 which had a NULL pointer dereference risk). This commit is just improving test logic. This is a quality-of-life improvement for testing infrastructure, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
be4ae8c19492c cpufreq: tegra186: Share policy per cluster
- [sasha] Let me check the commit message context and understand the security implications: **CVE ANALYSIS:** **NO** This commit is a functional enhancement that changes CPU frequency policy management to share policies across cores within the same cluster, aligning tegra186 behavior with tegra194 and tegra210. **Reasoning:** 1. **No Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is to bring "functional" alignment between Tegra SoC generations, not fixing a security issue. 2. **Feature Enhancement**: The code changes only add policy sharing logic (`cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, policy->cpus)`) which is a standard cpufreq framework feature for clustering cores under the same frequency policy. 3. **No Vulnerability Indicators**: - No buffer overflows, bounds checking, or memory safety fixes - No access control or privilege changes - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes - The changes are purely organizational/structural 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: All 5 reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar functional/organizational changes without security implications, supporting the pattern that such commits typically don't warrant CVEs. 5. **Positive Security Impact**: If anything, this change improves system consistency and potentially reduces attack surface by standardizing behavior across Tegra platforms. The addition of the cpumask logic simply ensures all CPUs in a cluster share the same cpufreq policy, which is a standard power management optimization with no security vulnerability being addressed.
59228c6631f90 drm/amdkfd: clear F8_MODE for gfx950
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis of the commit and the Linux kernel AMD GPU driver codebase, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. The commit removes `IP_VERSION(9, 5, 0)` from a condition that sets the F8_MODE bit in the SH_MEM_CONFIG register for gfx950 hardware. This is a **functional correctness fix** rather than a security vulnerability fix. Key reasons why this doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **Non-security functional change**: The F8_MODE bit controls floating-point data format behavior (F8 vs OCP format), not memory access controls or security boundaries. 2. **Hardware-specific optimization**: The commit message explicitly states "Default F8_MODE should be OCP format on gfx950", indicating this is the manufacturer's recommended configuration for this hardware generation. 3. **No privilege implications**: The change affects compute shader memory configuration within the same privilege level, not kernel/user security boundaries. 4. **Pattern matches hardware differences**: Similar hardware-specific configurations already exist in the codebase for different GPU generations (gfx943, gfx944 vs gfx950). 5. **No prior security context**: No previous CVEs or security issues were found related to F8_MODE or similar floating-point format configuration in AMD GPU drivers. This appears to be a routine hardware compatibility fix to ensure gfx950 uses its optimal floating-point format by default, similar to other vendor-specific hardware configuration adjustments.
36a1cfd497435 iommu/amd/pgtbl_v2: Improve error handling
- [sasha] **CVE STATUS: NO** **Analysis:** This commit makes a simple error code correction in the AMD IOMMU v2 page table implementation. The change is from returning `-EINVAL` to `-ENOMEM` when `v2_alloc_pte()` fails to allocate memory. **Key observations:** 1. **Error handling improvement only**: The commit only changes the error return code from `-EINVAL` to `-ENOMEM` when memory allocation fails. This is a correctness improvement that makes the error code semantically accurate. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: - The original code path already handled the failure case by returning an error and going to the cleanup path - No out-of-bounds access, buffer overflow, or privilege escalation is being addressed - The function already returned early on allocation failure, preventing any dangerous operations 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also an error handling fix in AMD IOMMU without security implications - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): NUMA node handling improvement, similar low-impact change - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Type system improvement, no security impact - Commits 2 & 4 (YES CVE): These prevented out-of-bounds array access - a clear security issue 4. **Impact assessment**: This change only affects the specific error code returned to callers when memory allocation fails. It doesn't fix any memory safety issue, access control problem, or other security-relevant bug. The commit improves code correctness by using the appropriate error code (`-ENOMEM` for memory allocation failure vs `-EINVAL` for invalid parameters), but does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
61972cd93af70 drm/amdkfd: Set per-process flags only once for gfx9/10/11/12
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** The commit is a code refactoring that moves static hardware configuration from `update_qpd()` (called every time a queue is created) to `set_cache_memory_policy()` (called once during process initialization). This is purely an optimization to avoid redundant work. **Key evidence against CVE assignment:** 1. **No security vulnerability fix**: The commit message describes this as an optimization ("Set per-process flags only once") rather than fixing any security issue. The code is simply moving existing configuration logic to run less frequently. 2. **Consistent with existing architecture**: For newer GPU generations (v10, v11, v12), the `update_qpd()` functions were already empty (just `return 0`). This change brings v9 in line with that pattern. 3. **No sensitive behavior changes**: The commit moves memory policy configuration (`sh_mem_config`, `sh_mem_bases`, etc.) but doesn't change what values are set or how they're validated. The actual configuration values remain identical. 4. **Performance optimization pattern**: This follows a common kernel optimization pattern of moving one-time initialization out of frequently-called code paths. **Comparison with similar commits:** Looking at the provided examples, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" include similar refactoring and optimization changes (like "Set per-process flags only once" type modifications), while the one marked "CVE Status: YES" actually fixed a memory leak vulnerability. This commit is clearly a performance optimization rather than a security fix, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
cf3d0c54b21c4 fs/pipe: Limit the slots in pipe_resize_ring()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me summarize the security implications: **CVE ANALYSIS** **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** 1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a security issue where `pipe_resize_ring()` could accept `nr_slots` values larger than the maximum representable value for `pipe_index_t` type, which is: - On 64-bit: `unsigned int` (max: 4,294,967,295) - On 32-bit: `unsigned short` (max: 65,535) 2. **User-Controlled Input**: The vulnerability is reachable through user-controlled input via: - `fcntl(fd, F_SETPIPE_SZ, size)` syscall - The `size` parameter is converted to `nr_slots = round_pipe_size(size) >> PAGE_SHIFT` - With PAGE_SHIFT=12, a user could pass large values that result in `nr_slots` exceeding the `pipe_index_t` limits 3. **Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states that values beyond the max limit "can lead to incorrect pipe occupancy related calculations where the pipe will never appear full." This is a serious issue because: - The `pipe_occupancy()` function uses `(pipe_index_t)(head - tail)` calculation - Integer overflow in head/tail values would cause incorrect occupancy calculations - This could lead to incorrect resource accounting and potential denial-of-service conditions 4. **Pattern Match with Similar CVEs**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 5 (Input: MT - limit max slots) which was assigned a CVE for limiting user-controlled allocation sizes to prevent memory allocation attacks. 5. **Fix Pattern**: The fix adds a bounds check `if (unlikely(nr_slots > (pipe_index_t)-1u))` which is a classic security hardening pattern to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities. The commit fixes a user-reachable integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to incorrect pipe state calculations and resource accounting issues.
289e68503a453 drm/amdkfd: Set per-process flags only once cik/vi
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. While it addresses important security improvements, it is a code refactoring/optimization rather than fixing an active vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of Change**: The commit moves static memory policy configuration from `update_qpd()` (called per queue creation) to `set_cache_memory_policy()` (called once during process initialization). This is primarily an optimization to avoid redundant work. 2. **No Vulnerability Indication**: - The commit message describes this as an optimization ("Set per-process static sh_mem config only once") - No mention of fixing bugs, race conditions, or security issues - The word "static" indicates these values don't change, so setting them once vs. multiple times doesn't create a functional difference 3. **Code Analysis**: - The moved code involves `sh_mem_config`, `sh_mem_ape1_base`, and `sh_mem_ape1_limit` settings - These are hardware register configurations for memory management - The validation logic for APE1 apertures (address bounds checking) remains the same - No changes to the actual security checks or memory access controls 4. **Pattern from Similar Commits**: All the provided reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar refactoring/optimization changes without security implications. 5. **Technical Impact**: Moving static configuration from a per-queue function to a per-process function improves efficiency but doesn't change the security model or fix any exploitable conditions. This is a performance optimization that improves code organization but does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
6b80c0abe475e coresight-etb10: change etb_drvdata spinlock's type to raw_spinlock_t
- [sasha] Now I have enough information to analyze this commit. Let me examine the key aspects: 1. **The Issue**: This commit changes `spinlock_t` to `raw_spinlock_t` in the coresight-etb10 driver 2. **The Context**: The spinlock can be held during `perf_event_task_sched_out()`, which is called from the scheduler after acquiring `rq_lock` (a raw_spinlock_t) 3. **The Problem**: In PREEMPT_RT kernels, `spinlock_t` becomes sleepable, but sleeping while holding a raw_spinlock_t (rq_lock) causes "sleep in atomic context" errors **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No security vulnerability**: This is purely a correctness fix for PREEMPT_RT kernels. The issue is about lock ordering and sleeping constraints, not a security flaw that could be exploited. 2. **RT-specific compatibility issue**: The problem only manifests in PREEMPT_RT kernels where spinlock semantics change. In standard kernels, both `spinlock_t` and `raw_spinlock_t` behave identically from a security perspective. 3. **No exploitable impact**: The "sleep in atomic context" warning is a kernel debugging message that indicates improper lock usage, but doesn't create memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues. 4. **Pattern matches non-CVE examples**: This follows the same pattern as "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 4" which were marked as NO for CVE status - they're RT kernel compatibility fixes, not security fixes. 5. **Code changes are mechanical**: The changes simply replace `spin_lock*` calls with `raw_spin_lock*` calls and change the lock type declaration. No logic changes, no bounds checking additions, no access control modifications. This is a kernel subsystem compatibility improvement, not a security fix warranting a CVE.
89be3c15a58b2 ASoC: qcom: sm8250: explicitly set format in sm8250_be_hw_params_fixup()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds explicit format setting (`snd_mask_set_format(fmt, SNDRV_PCM_FORMAT_S16_LE)`) to the `sm8250_be_hw_params_fixup()` function. This is a functional enhancement, not a security fix. 2. **Purpose**: According to the commit message, this change is "required for compressed playback on compatible soundcards" - it's adding missing functionality to enable a feature, not fixing a vulnerability. 3. **Code Pattern Comparison**: Looking at similar `be_hw_params_fixup` functions in other Qualcomm sound drivers (like `apq8096_be_hw_params_fixup`), they typically only set rate and channel parameters. The explicit format setting appears to be an audio subsystem requirement for certain playback modes. 4. **Risk Assessment**: This change adds a header include and one function call that constrains the audio format to S16_LE. There are no memory operations, bounds checking, privilege changes, or other security-sensitive patterns present. 5. **Similar Commits**: The provided examples show that audio subsystem commits like this (adding compatible strings, fixing Kconfig dependencies, code style fixes) are consistently marked as "CVE Status: NO". 6. **Security Implications**: None identified. This is purely an audio functionality enhancement with no impact on system security, memory safety, access control, or other security-relevant subsystems. This falls into the category of a feature enhancement/bug fix for audio functionality rather than a security vulnerability fix.
0d9cabc8f591e drm/amd/display: Fix incorrect DPCD configs while Replay/PSR switch
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit and compare with the similar commits to make a determination: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** Based on my analysis of this commit compared to the similar commits provided, this should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This commit addresses incorrect DPCD (DisplayPort Configuration Data) configuration during PSR/Replay mode switching. The changes add initialization steps to clear previous mode configurations before setting up new ones. This is a functional correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - In `edp_setup_psr()`: Adds `memset(&psr_configuration, 0, sizeof(psr_configuration))` and a DPCD write to clear PSR configuration at lines 678-685 - In `edp_setup_replay()`: Adds a DPCD write to clear Replay configuration at lines 962-965 and initializes `replay_error_status.raw = 0` at line 970 - These are defensive initialization steps, not security-critical fixes 3. **Similar Commit Patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits: - Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, and 5 were all marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with PSR/Replay functionality fixes - Only Similar Commit 3 was marked "CVE Status: YES" because it fixed a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability (use-before-check) - This commit follows the pattern of commits 1, 2, 4, and 5 (functional fixes) rather than commit 3 (security fix) 4. **Impact Assessment**: The issue being fixed (incorrect DPCD configs causing "unexpected behavior in TCON") appears to be a display functionality problem rather than a security vulnerability. There's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impacts. 5. **Commit Message Analysis**: The commit message describes a functional issue with display hardware configuration, not a security vulnerability. The language used ("unexpected behavior") suggests functionality problems rather than exploitable conditions. This commit addresses a display driver configuration issue and follows the pattern of other non-CVE display fixes in the similar commits.
8a21da2842bb2 drm/amd/display: not abort link train when bw is low
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and kernel tree context, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit modifies the DisplayPort link training logic to continue with link training even when bandwidth becomes insufficient after fallback, specifically for DP tunneling compliance tests. The key change is removing the early return that would abort link training when `is_link_bw_low` is true. **Why this doesn't warrant a CVE:** 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This is a compliance/functionality fix, not a security bug fix. The commit message clearly states it's to prevent failing compliance tests. 2. **No security-sensitive components affected**: The change is in display driver link training logic, which doesn't involve memory safety, access control, or privilege escalation. 3. **No dangerous behavior introduced**: The change actually makes the system more permissive by continuing with degraded settings rather than aborting, which doesn't introduce new attack vectors. 4. **Similar pattern to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, those marked "CVE Status: YES" fix system hangs (stability issues that could be DoS vectors), while those marked "CVE Status: NO" are feature/compliance fixes like this one. 5. **Code change nature**: The modification removes a safety check that causes early termination, but this is intentional for compliance purposes and doesn't create memory corruption, buffer overflows, or other security vulnerabilities. The change is specifically designed to make DP tunneling more robust for compliance testing by allowing degraded operation rather than complete failure, which is a quality-of-life improvement rather than a security fix.
09965a1420780 auxdisplay: charlcd: Partially revert "Move hwidth and bwidth to struct hd44780_common"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **This is a refactoring/improvement commit, not a security fix**: The commit message explicitly states it's a "partial revert" that "restores behavior" from a previous commit. This indicates it's restoring a preferred allocation pattern rather than fixing a vulnerability. 2. **No security vulnerability indicators in the changes**: The code changes show: - `charlcd_alloc()` function signature changed from `void` to `unsigned int drvdata_size` - Memory allocation changed from `kzalloc(sizeof(*priv))` to `kzalloc(sizeof(*priv) + drvdata_size)` - Added `lcd->drvdata = priv->drvdata;` to set up driver data pointer - All callers updated to pass `0` as the size parameter 3. **This improves memory management but doesn't fix exploitable bugs**: While this change does improve memory management by consolidating allocations (reducing potential for memory leaks and use-after-free), there's no indication that the previous pattern created exploitable security vulnerabilities. The drivers were already properly managing their separate allocations. 4. **Similar patterns in reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar commits 1, 2, and 4 were marked "NO" for CVE status and involved API misuse fixes or build configuration changes - Similar commit 3 was marked "YES" but involved an actual memory leak where allocated memory was "never freed" - This commit doesn't show the same pattern of an actual security bug being fixed 5. **Language indicates enhancement, not bug fix**: The commit message uses language like "restore that behaviour" and references improving allocation efficiency, rather than security-oriented language about fixing vulnerabilities. This appears to be a code quality improvement that consolidates memory allocation for better maintainability and efficiency, but not a security vulnerability fix warranting a CVE assignment.
756e58e83e89d drm/amd/display: remove minimum Dispclk and apply oem panel timing.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Clock Management Optimization, Not Security Fix**: The commit removes minimum clock constraints (`MIN_DPP_DISP_CLK` for `dispclk`) and applies OEM panel timing more broadly. These are performance/compatibility optimizations, not security fixes. 2. **Non-Security Code Changes**: - Removing the `dispclk` minimum constraint (lines removing `if (new_clocks->dispclk_khz < MIN_DPP_DISP_CLK)`) is about allowing lower clock speeds for power efficiency - Expanding OEM panel timing application from OLED-only to all panels (changing `if (!enable && link->dpcd_sink_ext_caps.bits.oled)` to `if (!enable)`) is a compatibility enhancement 3. **No Security-Relevant Patterns**: The changes don't show any of the security vulnerability patterns such as: - Buffer overflow fixes - Access control changes - Input validation improvements - Memory leak fixes - Race condition fixes - Privilege escalation fixes 4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is very similar to the provided reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are all AMD display driver optimizations and bug fixes that don't address security vulnerabilities. 5. **Display Hardware Configuration**: The changes are purely about display hardware clock management and panel timing configuration, which are not security-sensitive operations. The commit message clearly states this is about applying OEM panel timing and removing minimum clock constraints for better compatibility, not fixing any security issue.
480ee8a260e6f watchdog: s3c2410_wdt: Fix PMU register bits for ExynosAutoV920 SoC
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Analysis of the Code Changes:** The commit fixes incorrect PMU register bit definitions for the ExynosAutoV920 SoC: 1. **rst_stat_bit**: Changes from 25→0 (cl0) and 24→1 (cl1) 2. **cnt_en_bit**: Changes from 7→8 (both clusters) **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Configuration Error, Not Logic Flaw**: This is a hardware abstraction layer configuration error where the wrong register bits were used for a specific SoC variant. The driver logic itself is correct. 2. **No Direct Security Impact**: The incorrect bits don't: - Allow privilege escalation - Expose sensitive data - Create exploitable attack vectors - Enable unauthorized access 3. **Functional vs. Security Issue**: While wrong register bits could cause: - Watchdog counter to not enable properly (using bit 7 instead of 8) - Incorrect reset status detection (reading bits 25/24 instead of 0/1) These are reliability/availability issues rather than security vulnerabilities. 4. **Limited Scope**: Only affects ExynosAutoV920 SoC and requires the system to already be in a compromised state to be exploitable. 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: The provided examples show similar watchdog driver fixes that were not assigned CVEs, including register bit corrections and PMU-related changes. The fix is important for system stability and proper watchdog functionality, but it addresses a hardware-specific configuration error rather than a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
334dc5fcc3f17 drm/amdgpu: increase RAS bad page threshold
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the deeper investigation into the RAS bad page threshold functionality, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Logic Correction, Not Security Fix**: The changes modify the threshold comparison operators from `>=` to `>` in three locations. This is a behavioral refinement to the threshold logic, changing when the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) event is triggered from "when reaching exactly the threshold" to "when exceeding the threshold." 2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is for "default policy" behavior improvement - making the driver issue an RMA event when bad pages are "greater than" rather than "reaches" the threshold. This doesn't fix any security vulnerability like buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, or access control issues that were present in the CVE-assigned similar commits. 3. **Functional Enhancement, Not Bug Fix**: The code changes are: - Line 759: `control->ras_num_bad_pages >= ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold` → `control->ras_num_bad_pages > ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold` - Line 818: `control->ras_num_bad_pages < ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold` → `control->ras_num_bad_pages <= ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold` - Line 1468: `ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold > control->ras_num_bad_pages` → `ras->bad_page_cnt_threshold >= control->ras_num_bad_pages` These are symmetric logical adjustments to make the threshold behavior consistent. 4. **No Crash/Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the CVE-assigned examples which fixed null pointer dereferences, double-free issues, and missing null checks, this commit doesn't address any memory safety or crash-related vulnerabilities. 5. **Policy Change, Not Security Fix**: This is essentially a policy adjustment for when hardware replacement recommendations are made, not a fix for exploitable code flaws. The commit improves the consistency of RAS bad page threshold logic but does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security, cause crashes, or enable unauthorized access.
a18dfa9925b9e ipv6: save dontfrag in cork
- [sasha] **NO** This commit fixes a behavioral consistency issue with the IPv6 dontfrag flag during multi-part datagram construction, but it is not a security vulnerability. **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue was that when using MSG_MORE to construct datagrams across multiple send calls, the dontfrag flag wasn't being preserved in the cork structure like other per-datagram settings (hop_limit, tclass). This could cause inconsistent fragmentation behavior within a single datagram. 2. **Code changes**: The fix adds `dontfrag` to `struct inet6_cork` (line 210 in ipv6.h) and ensures it's stored during setup (`v6_cork->dontfrag = ipc6->dontfrag;` in `ip6_setup_cork`) and used consistently (`v6_cork->dontfrag` instead of `ipc6->dontfrag` in the fragmentation check at line 1479). 3. **Security impact**: This is a **correctness/consistency bug**, not a security vulnerability. The dontfrag flag controls packet fragmentation behavior - inconsistent behavior could cause packets to be fragmented when they shouldn't be (or vice versa), but this doesn't create: - Memory corruption issues - Buffer overflows - Access control bypasses - Information disclosure - Privilege escalation opportunities 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: This matches the pattern of commits 1, 2, and 5 (marked "CVE Status: NO") which fix consistency/correctness issues, rather than commits 3 and 4 (marked "CVE Status: YES") which fix memory safety issues like uninit-value access. The commit improves network stack correctness but doesn't address a security vulnerability.
607ba1bb09611 iommu/vt-d: Check if SVA is supported when attaching the SVA domain
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the supporting evidence from the kernel tree, let me now evaluate the security implications: ## Analysis Summary This commit makes a **hardening improvement** by moving SVA (Shared Virtual Addressing) support validation from a feature-enable path to the actual domain attach/allocation paths. The key changes are: 1. **Removed `intel_iommu_enable_sva()` function** - This function was being called during feature enablement 2. **Added `intel_iommu_sva_supported()` function** - New comprehensive validation function 3. **Added validation to `intel_svm_set_dev_pasid()`** - SVA support is now checked when attaching SVA domain 4. **Added validation to `intel_svm_domain_alloc()`** - SVA support is now checked when allocating SVA domain ## Security Assessment **CVE Status: NO** ### Rationale: 1. **This is a hardening improvement, not a vulnerability fix**: - The commit strengthens validation by moving checks closer to where they're actually needed - There's no evidence this fixes a vulnerability where unsupported devices could access SVA functionality 2. **Similar to reference commits marked "NO"**: - Like Similar Commit 1 & 2, this adds validation checks without indicating a security flaw was being fixed - Similar Commit 4 also shows refactoring/improvement work without security implications 3. **No security language in commit message**: - The commit message describes this as a "check" and mentions "should fail if SVA is not supported" - No mention of fixing security issues, preventing attacks, or addressing vulnerabilities 4. **Code changes show defensive programming**: - The validation logic (`intel_iommu_sva_supported()`) is essentially the same code moved from `intel_iommu_enable_sva()` - This is architectural improvement to ensure validation happens at the right time 5. **Contrast with CVE-worthy commits**: - Similar Commits 3 & 5 (marked "YES") fix actual problems like "potential for crashing" and cleanup issues - This commit proactively improves validation timing rather than fixing a demonstrated issue This commit represents good defensive programming practice by ensuring SVA support validation occurs at domain attach/allocation time, but does not fix an exploitable security vulnerability.
e16caea70610e wifi: cfg80211: Update the link address when a link is added
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze both the message and code changes to determine if it addresses a security vulnerability. Let me examine the commit details: **Subject**: "wifi: cfg80211: Update the link address when a link is added" **Code Analysis**: The commit adds functionality to update wireless device link addresses when MLO (Multi-Link Operation) links are added. Specifically: 1. **New field added**: `u8 *addr;` in the `cfg80211_mlo_reconf_done_data` structure 2. **New code added**: A `memcpy` operation that copies link addresses: ```c memcpy(wdev->links[link_id].addr, data->links[link_id].addr, ETH_ALEN); ``` **Security Assessment**: 1. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message indicates this is adding new functionality ("Update the link address when a link is added"), not fixing a security issue. 2. **No bounds checking issues**: The code uses `ETH_ALEN` (6 bytes) which is the standard Ethernet address length, and the destination `wdev->links[link_id].addr` appears to be properly sized. 3. **Array access protection**: The `link_id` is bounded by `ARRAY_SIZE(data->links)` in the surrounding loop, and there's validation that ensures only valid links are processed. 4. **Feature enhancement**: This appears to be implementing missing functionality for MLO reconfiguration rather than fixing a security flaw. 5. **Similar commits**: All the provided similar commits have "CVE Status: NO" and involve WiFi functionality improvements rather than security fixes. **Conclusion**: This commit adds new functionality to properly handle link addresses during MLO reconfiguration. There's no indication in the commit message or code changes that this fixes a security vulnerability - it's implementing a missing feature. **NO** This commit implements new functionality for updating link addresses during MLO reconfiguration rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The code changes add a straightforward memcpy operation with proper bounds (ETH_ALEN) and the commit message describes feature addition, not security remediation.
6e51a1279cd60 block: acquire q->limits_lock while reading sysfs attributes
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, along with examination of the locking mechanisms and potential race conditions: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary **Primary Issue**: The commit fixes a **data race condition** where sysfs read operations used `q->sysfs_lock` while write operations used `q->limits_lock` for the same queue limits data. **Key Changes**: 1. Added `show_limit()` method to ensure reads also use `q->limits_lock` 2. Converted many sysfs attributes to use unified locking via `QUEUE_LIM_RO_ENTRY` and `QUEUE_LIM_RW_ENTRY` macros 3. Modified `queue_attr_show()` to acquire `limits_lock` when `show_limit` is present **Security Assessment**: 1. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The `queue_limits` structure is embedded (not dynamically allocated), eliminating use-after-free risks 2. **Limited Information Disclosure**: While torn reads could theoretically leak kernel state, it's constrained to specific I/O parameters with limited value to attackers 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: These sysfs attributes don't control security-critical operations 4. **Architectural Protections**: Modern CPUs provide natural atomicity for aligned reads, reducing practical exploitation **Classification**: This is a **correctness and reliability fix** rather than a security vulnerability. The inconsistent locking could cause I/O parameter corruption leading to system instability, but lacks the characteristics typically associated with CVE-worthy security flaws. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: The provided examples show commits that fix deadlocks (CVE-worthy due to DoS potential), while this commit addresses a data race that primarily affects system correctness rather than security.
cf4bd16088827 wifi: cfg80211: allow IR in 20 MHz configurations
- [sasha] Now I understand how this works. Let me analyze the security implications: ## Analysis This commit introduces a new regulatory feature that allows WiFi access points and P2P Group Owners to initiate radiation (IR) on channels that are normally marked as NO_IR, but only when using 20 MHz bandwidth. **Key changes:** 1. Adds `IEEE80211_CHAN_ALLOW_20MHZ_ACTIVITY` flag 2. Adds `NL80211_RRF_ALLOW_20MHZ_ACTIVITY` regulatory rule flag 3. Modifies `cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing()` to allow 20 MHz activity even on NO_IR channels **Security Analysis:** This is **NOT** a security vulnerability fix, but rather a new regulatory feature. Here's why: 1. **Regulatory Compliance Feature**: The commit allows WiFi devices to transmit on certain channels with 20 MHz bandwidth where broader bandwidths are prohibited by regulatory bodies. 2. **Controlled Relaxation**: The code specifically checks for: - Interface type must be AP or P2P_GO - Channel width must be exactly 20 MHz (NL80211_CHAN_WIDTH_20_NOHT or NL80211_CHAN_WIDTH_20) - Only applies when the permitting flag is set by regulatory rules 3. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: This doesn't bypass security controls, but rather implements a specific regulatory exception for narrow bandwidth operation. 4. **Follows Similar Pattern**: The code follows the same pattern as the existing `IEEE80211_CHAN_ALLOW_6GHZ_VLP_AP` flag, which allows VLP AP operation despite NO_IR restrictions. 5. **No Access Control or Memory Safety Issues**: The changes don't involve buffer overflows, privilege escalation, race conditions, or other typical security vulnerability patterns. **CVE Status: NO** This commit introduces new functionality to comply with specific regulatory requirements, not a security fix. It's a controlled feature addition that allows transmissions under very specific, regulated conditions (20 MHz bandwidth only).
d3069feecdb55 drm/amd/display: calculate the remain segments for all pipes
- [sasha] Now let me understand the code change by looking at what exactly was modified in the commit. The key change appears to be the removal of the condition checking for top_pipe and prev_odm_pipe: ## Analysis of the Security Impact Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and understanding of the DET buffer management system, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: ### 1. **Nature of the Fix** The commit fixes a **resource allocation accounting bug** rather than a security vulnerability. The issue is that the algorithm was incorrectly calculating remaining DET buffer segments by only counting "top pipes" in the first loop but then trying to distribute the remaining segments to **all pipes** (including non-top pipes) in the second loop. ### 2. **What the Bug Actually Does** - **Before fix:** Only top pipes were counted when calculating `remaining_det_segs`, but all pipes received allocations - **After fix:** All pipes are counted consistently in both calculation and distribution phases - **Impact:** The bug could cause the total DET buffer allocation to exceed the hardware maximum, but this is caught by bounds checking ### 3. **Bounds Checking Prevents Security Issues** The code has multiple layers of protection: ```c if (pipes[pipe_cnt].pipe.src.det_size_override > 2 linux DCN3_15_MAX_DET_SEGS) { /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var Clamp to 2 pipe split max det segments linux/ remaining_det_segs += pipes[pipe_cnt].pipe.src.det_size_override - 2 linux (DCN3_15_MAX_DET_SEGS); pipes[pipe_cnt].pipe.src.det_size_override = 2 linux DCN3_15_MAX_DET_SEGS; } ``` ### 4. **Display Functionality vs Security** This affects display rendering performance and correctness, not system security: - **Symptoms:** Visual corruption/underflow in specific multi-pipe scenarios - **Scope:** Limited to display subsystem functionality - **No memory corruption:** The bug doesn't lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption outside of display hardware registers ### 5. **Similar Commits Pattern** Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar commit 1 (NO CVE): Also fixes DET allocation logic for display corruption - Similar commits 2&3 (YES CVE): Fix **divide-by-zero** vulnerabilities with input validation - Similar commit 4 (YES CVE): Fixes calculation leading to display corruption - Similar commit 5 (NO CVE): Fixes scaling calculations for display corruption The pattern shows that arithmetic/calculation fixes that don't involve input validation, divide-by-zero, or direct security implications typically don't warrant CVEs. ### 6. **Impact Assessment** - **Availability:** May cause display issues but not system crashes - **Integrity:** No data corruption outside display buffers - **Confidentiality:** No information disclosure - **Privilege escalation:** None possible from this bug This is a **display subsystem functionality fix** that prevents visual corruption by correctly accounting for DET buffer segment allocation across all pipes, rather than a security vulnerability.
0e104aa3676d0 wifi: mac80211: fix warning on disconnect during failed ML reconf
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue. Looking at line 3356, there's a `WARN_ON(!pub)` which means cfg80211_unlink_bss will trigger a warning if called with a NULL BSS pointer. Let me understand the commit better. The fix adds a check `!link->conf->bss` before calling `cfg80211_unlink_bss(local->hw.wiphy, link->conf->bss)`. This prevents calling the function with a NULL BSS, which would trigger the warning at line 3356. Looking at the commit message and the similar commits provided: **Analysis:** **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a defensive fix to prevent a warning (WARN_ON) in cfg80211_unlink_bss when called with a NULL BSS pointer. The warning occurs at line 3356 in `/net/wireless/scan.c`: `if (WARN_ON(!pub)) return;` 2. **No Security Impact**: The fix prevents a kernel warning, but this warning doesn't represent a security vulnerability: - The WARN_ON simply returns early if the BSS pointer is NULL - No memory corruption, information disclosure, or privilege escalation occurs - No system crash or denial of service results from this condition 3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are defensive fixes that prevent warnings or improve error handling without security implications - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involve actual resource leaks or improper validation that could lead to security issues 4. **Code Change Analysis**: The fix simply adds `|| !link->conf->bss` to an existing null check before calling `cfg80211_unlink_bss()`. This prevents calling the function with a NULL BSS pointer, which would only trigger a warning and early return. 5. **Context**: This occurs during multi-link reconfiguration failure handling - a relatively new WiFi 7 feature. The warning appears when a link is allocated but the BSS entry isn't assigned yet, which is a legitimate state during failed operations. The commit is a quality-of-life improvement to reduce spurious warnings, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
c3171bed65ec3 wifi: mac80211: don't include MLE in ML reconf per-STA profile
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase, let me provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Code Changes Analysis The commit makes two specific changes: 1. **Type change**: Changes `assoc_link_id` from `unsigned int` to `s8` in the `ieee80211_mgd_assoc_data` structure (line 461 in ieee80211_i.h) 2. **Initialization change**: Sets `data->assoc_link_id = -1` in the ML reconfiguration function (line 10427 in mlme.c) ## Security Assessment **This is NOT a security vulnerability** for the following reasons: 1. **Protocol Compliance Fix**: The commit addresses a WiFi protocol compliance issue where multi-link reconfiguration frames incorrectly included Multi-Link Elements (MLE) in per-STA profiles for added links. This is a protocol correctness issue, not a security flaw. 2. **Defensive Programming**: Setting `assoc_link_id = -1` is a defensive measure to prevent erroneous matching when `link_id` happens to be zero. Looking at the parsing logic in `/home/sasha/e/linux/net/mac80211/parse.c:920-921`, when `link_id == -1`, the parser returns early and doesn't attempt to extract STA profiles, which is the intended behavior for ML reconf frames. 3. **No Attack Vector**: There's no indication that this issue could be exploited maliciously. The commit message and code changes show this is about ensuring correct protocol behavior, not fixing an exploitable vulnerability. 4. **Similar Pattern**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits provided, which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO". These are all WiFi protocol compliance and correctness fixes rather than security vulnerabilities. 5. **Limited Impact**: The issue only affects multi-link WiFi operation and frame construction - it doesn't involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any traditional security vulnerability patterns. The commit prevents potential protocol violations but doesn't address any exploitable security weakness that could compromise system security.
3ea2970b05780 wifi: iwlwifi: fix the ECKV UEFI variable name
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the complete flow. The macro `IWL_BIOS_TABLE_LOADER_DATA(eckv, u32)` creates the function `iwl_bios_get_eckv()` which calls `GET_BIOS_TABLE(eckv, fwrt, data)` which in turn first tries `iwl_uefi_get_eckv()` and falls back to `iwl_acpi_get_eckv()` if UEFI fails. Now let me analyze the security implications of this commit: **CVE ANALYSIS:** ## NO **Explanation:** This commit fixes a configuration issue with UEFI variable naming and GUID selection, but it does not address a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit corrects: - Variable name from `L"UefiCnvWlanECKV"` to `L"UefiCnvCommonECKV"` - GUID from `IWL_EFI_WIFI_GUID` to `IWL_EFI_WIFI_BT_GUID` 2. **What ECKV Controls**: The ECKV (External Clock Valid) parameter controls whether the WiFi device uses an external 32KHz clock source for power management. From the code analysis: - `ext_clock_valid` is stored in `mvm->ext_clock_valid` or `trans->conf.ext_32khz_clock_valid` - Used in power management via `DEVICE_POWER_FLAGS_32K_CLK_VALID_MSK` flag - This is a hardware configuration setting, not a security control 3. **Impact Assessment**: - **Before fix**: Driver was reading from wrong UEFI variable name/GUID, likely getting default values - **After fix**: Driver correctly reads the intended UEFI variable - **Security impact**: None - this only affects power management/clock configuration 4. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The fix does not: - Address memory corruption issues - Fix privilege escalation vectors - Resolve input validation problems - Prevent information disclosure - Fix access control bypasses 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" are similar configuration/naming fixes that don't address security vulnerabilities. This is a straightforward configuration fix to ensure the driver reads the correct UEFI variable for hardware clock settings. No CVE assignment is warranted.
7a6a740be17e0 wifi: mac80211: fix U-APSD check in ML reconfiguration
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis **What the change does:** The commit fixes overly restrictive validation logic in WiFi Multi-Link Operation (MLO) reconfiguration. It changes the U-APSD (power management) check from requiring bidirectional feature parity to only requiring support when the client actually uses the feature. **Before:** Rejected ML reconfigurations if new AP links had different U-APSD support than what the client was using **After:** Only requires U-APSD support from new links IF the client has it enabled ## Security Assessment **No security vulnerability exists because:** 1. **No privilege escalation** - The change doesn't grant attackers any new capabilities 2. **Client-controlled** - U-APSD usage remains controlled by the client's `IEEE80211_STA_UAPSD_ENABLED` flag 3. **Proper validation preserved** - Still validates U-APSD availability when the client needs it 4. **Standards-compliant** - Aligns with normal WiFi behavior where APs can support more features than clients use **What this actually fixes:** - False rejections of legitimate ML reconfigurations - Artificial requirement for feature parity instead of capability validation - Bug where valid APs were rejected for supporting features the client didn't use **Comparison to similar commits:** Like the provided examples, this is a correctness/compatibility fix in WiFi protocol handling, not a security vulnerability. It removes overly strict validation that was causing legitimate operations to fail. The fix maintains all security properties while allowing proper WiFi Multi-Link operation according to IEEE 802.11be standards.
eb29b4ffafb20 wifi: iwlwifi: fix debug actions order
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because it is a stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit reorders function calls in the debug handling code, moving `iwl_dbg_tlv_apply_config()` to execute after `iwl_dbg_tlv_tp_trigger()` instead of before it. 2. **Root cause**: The commit message states that "some of the actions taken when applying the config will now crash the device" due to incorrect ordering. This indicates a race condition/timing issue where hardware configuration was being applied while the firmware was in an unstable state. 3. **Impact analysis**: The issue causes device crashes during debug operations, but: - It's limited to debug functionality, not normal operation - There's no indication of memory corruption, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation - The crash appears to be a controlled kernel crash rather than exploitable memory corruption - No sensitive data exposure or unauthorized access is mentioned 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar Commit 3 (CVE Status: YES) involved actual memory corruption with buffer overrun potential - Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, 5 (CVE Status: NO) were stability fixes without security implications - This commit is more similar to the non-CVE commits in nature 5. **Code pattern**: The changes only reorder existing function calls without adding new validation, bounds checking, or security controls - indicating this is about proper sequencing rather than fixing exploitable conditions. This is a reliability/stability fix that prevents kernel crashes during debug operations, but does not represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
72c96a2dacc0f printk: Check CON_SUSPEND when unblanking a console
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit is a minor improvement in console state management logic, not a security fix. It adds a check for the `CON_SUSPENDED` flag to prevent calling the `unblank()` callback on suspended consoles. 2. **Functional improvement, not security fix**: The change is purely functional - it prevents unnecessary operations on consoles that are suspended and won't be displaying anything anyway. The commit message explicitly states this is about avoiding pointless operations ("don't unblank suspended consoles because it won't be showing anything either way"). 3. **No security-sensitive components affected**: - No memory safety issues (no buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No access control changes - No privilege escalation potential - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes 4. **Limited scope and impact**: The change only affects the `console_unblank()` function by adding two simple flag checks (`if (flags & CON_SUSPENDED) continue;`). This is a conservative change that simply skips suspended consoles rather than fixing any dangerous behavior. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also minor functional improvements, code refactoring, or small bug fixes without security implications. This commit follows the same pattern. The commit improves code correctness by respecting console suspension state, but there's no indication that the previous behavior created any security vulnerability or could be exploited maliciously.
dbcfcb239b3b4 hwmon: (dell-smm) Increment the number of fans
- [sasha] Now I have a good understanding of the changes. Let me create a focused analysis of what this commit does and its security implications. **Analysis:** This commit increments `DELL_SMM_NO_FANS` from 3 to 4 to support Alienware laptops with up to 4 fans. Let me analyze the security implications: 1. **Code Changes:** - Changes `#define DELL_SMM_NO_FANS 3` to `#define DELL_SMM_NO_FANS 4` - Updates hwmon channel info to include a 4th fan and PWM channel - Updates documentation to reflect 4 fans instead of 3 2. **Array Access Analysis:** All fan-related arrays in the `dell_smm_data` structure are sized with `DELL_SMM_NO_FANS`: - `bool fan[DELL_SMM_NO_FANS];` (line 100) - `int fan_type[DELL_SMM_NO_FANS];` (line 101) - `int *fan_nominal_speed[DELL_SMM_NO_FANS];` (line 102) 3. **Bounds Checking:** The hwmon framework validates channels based on the declared channel info structure. The commit properly updates the `dell_smm_info` structure to declare 4 fan channels, so the hwmon core will only allow access to valid channels (0-3). 4. **Loop Bounds:** The initialization loop at line 1142 uses `for (i = 0; i < DELL_SMM_NO_FANS; i++)`, which will now correctly iterate over 4 fans instead of 3. **Security Assessment:** **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability:** This is a feature enhancement to support additional hardware (4th fan), not a security bug fix. 2. **Proper Bounds Management:** All arrays are consistently sized with `DELL_SMM_NO_FANS`, and the commit properly updates this constant along with all related data structures. 3. **No Buffer Overflow Risk:** The hwmon framework provides bounds checking at the interface level, and all internal array accesses use the same constant that was incremented. 4. **Similar to Reference Commits:** This change is very similar to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" that add hardware support (like "Dell G15 5511 to fan control whitelist" and "Extend support to more laptops"). 5. **No Privilege Escalation or Memory Corruption:** The change is a straightforward capacity increase with all related structures updated consistently. This is a benign hardware support enhancement, not a security fix.
3ad61970ac9e1 wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: fix setting the TK when associated
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this commit for CVE assignment: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a functional bug in WiFi ranging functionality, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Bug**: The issue is that when running secured ranging and the initiator is associated with the responder, the TK (Temporal Key) was not being properly set in the range request command. Looking at the code changes: - Before: The `target.tk` field was uninitialized when calling `ieee80211_iter_keys()`, and the retrieved TK was never copied to the output `tk` parameter - After: The fix initializes `target.tk = NULL`, and after the iteration, copies the retrieved TK to the output parameter if it was found 2. **Impact Assessment**: This bug would cause: - Incorrect/missing TK values in ranging requests when associated - Potential ranging functionality failure - No cryptographic keys being leaked or exposed - No unauthorized access or privilege escalation 3. **Security Implications**: While this involves cryptographic keys (TK), the bug does not: - Cause buffer overflows or memory corruption - Lead to information disclosure or key leakage - Enable privilege escalation or unauthorized access - Create exploitable security vulnerabilities 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples: - Similar commits that got CVEs (like the cipher pointer NULL dereference) involved actual crashes or undefined behavior - This commit fixes missing functionality rather than a security flaw - The fix ensures proper key handling rather than preventing a security breach 5. **Code Pattern**: The fix follows a standard pattern of initializing variables and checking return values, which is good defensive programming but addresses a functional issue rather than a security vulnerability. This is a functional correctness fix for WiFi ranging feature rather than a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
473367a5ffe16 r8169: increase max jumbo packet size on RTL8125/RTL8126
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Code Change Analysis:** The commit only adds a new constant `JUMBO_16K` and updates the `rtl_jumbo_max()` function to return this larger value for RTL8125/RTL8126 chips (MAC versions 61-71). This is purely increasing the maximum supported packet size from 9K to 16K based on hardware capabilities confirmed by Realtek. **Security Assessment:** 1. **Not a Security Fix**: This is a feature enhancement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message explicitly states this is about reflecting confirmed hardware capabilities. 2. **Controlled Change**: The modification only affects the maximum allowed packet size returned by `rtl_jumbo_max()`, which is used for MTU validation during network interface configuration. 3. **Proper Bounds**: The new `JUMBO_16K` constant is properly calculated as `(SZ_16K - VLAN_ETH_HLEN - ETH_FCS_LEN)`, maintaining proper header overhead accounting. 4. **Hardware-Confirmed Capability**: The change is based on vendor (Realtek) confirmation that the hardware supports these larger frames, and has been tested. **Comparison to Similar Commits:** - Similar Commits 1-3 and 5: All marked "NO" for CVE status, involving frame size/buffer adjustments that are performance/capability improvements - Similar Commit 4: Marked "YES" because it **fixed** a ring buffer corruption vulnerability **Key Distinction**: This commit **enables** a larger capability that the hardware already supports, rather than **fixing** a security vulnerability. The underlying packet processing infrastructure already handles these buffer sizes appropriately.
65bff0be9b154 wifi: mac80211_hwsim: Fix MLD address translation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the Linux kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Testing Framework Context**: The fix is in `mac80211_hwsim.c`, which is a software simulator for 802.11 radios used primarily for testing and development purposes, not production wireless drivers. This significantly limits the attack surface and real-world impact. 2. **Logic Improvement, Not Vulnerability Fix**: The change from `if (sta && sta->mlo) { if (WARN_ON(!link_sta)) {...}` to `if (sta && sta->mlo && link_sta)` is primarily a logic improvement that: - Eliminates unnecessary kernel warnings when `link_sta` is NULL - Ensures address translation only occurs when there's a valid link context - Prevents potential null pointer access 3. **No Evidence of Exploitable Security Impact**: While the original code could theoretically cause issues with address translation on non-shared links, there's no indication this could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code path leads to frame dropping (`ieee80211_free_txskb`) when conditions aren't met. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical examples provided, commits marked "CVE Status: NO" include similar logic fixes and improvements, while "CVE Status: YES" commits involve actual security vulnerabilities like incorrect pointer calculations (Similar Commit 4) or resource leaks affecting production functionality (Similar Commit 5). 5. **Preventive Nature**: The commit's message indicates this is about ensuring address translation happens "only between shared links" for correctness, not fixing an active vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security. This appears to be a code quality and correctness improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix that would warrant CVE assignment.
b2e709805ce95 wifi: iwlwifi: w/a FW SMPS mode selection
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the iwlwifi power management code in the kernel tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary 1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a functional bug fix addressing incorrect firmware behavior in SMPS (Spatial Multiplexing Power Save) mode selection, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code changes examination**: - The changes add a new function `iwl_mvm_smps_workaround()` that tracks power save state (`mvmvif->ps_disabled = !vif->cfg.ps`) - It's called during station state transitions (authorized state) and power save changes - The workaround ensures device-level power commands are sent when VIF-level power save changes 3. **Security implications**: - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, memory corruption, or improper memory access - **No privilege escalation**: Changes are within existing driver privilege boundaries - **No information disclosure**: No sensitive data exposure risk - **Limited DoS potential**: While incorrect power mode could affect performance/battery, it doesn't create a significant denial-of-service vulnerability 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All 5 similar commits analyzed were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar functional fixes in iwlwifi driver without security implications. 5. **Root cause**: The issue is firmware incorrectly checking `DEVICE_POWER_FLAGS_POWER_SAVE_ENA_MSK` instead of `POWER_FLAGS_POWER_MANAGEMENT_ENA_MSK` for SMPS mode determination - this is a functional misbehavior, not a security flaw. This is a quality/reliability fix to work around firmware behavior, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
7cbe799ac10fd mmc: dw_mmc: add exynos7870 DW MMC support
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the referenced similar commits, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **This is a hardware support addition, not a security fix**: The commit adds support for Exynos7870 DW MMC controllers by adding new device tree compatible strings and controller types. It's purely enabling hardware support. 2. **The quirk is hardware-specific functionality, not a security fix**: The `DW_MMC_QUIRK_FIFO64_32` quirk enables proper 64-bit FIFO access on controllers that require two 32-bit accesses instead of one 64-bit access. This is a hardware compatibility requirement, not a security vulnerability fix. 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (1-5) are marked as "CVE Status: NO" and they involve similar hardware support additions or quirk implementations for MMC controllers. This commit follows the exact same pattern. 4. **No security-sensitive components affected**: The changes only affect: - Device tree compatible string matching - Clock selection register handling - FIFO access method selection None of these involve security-critical operations like access control, memory safety, or privilege escalation. 5. **No security vulnerability indicators**: The commit message and code changes show no signs of fixing buffer overflows, memory leaks, race conditions, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities. It's purely adding support for new hardware variants. This is a straightforward hardware enablement commit that adds support for a new SoC variant using existing, well-tested code paths and quirks.
3832862eb9c4d iommu: Keep dev->iommu state consistent
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and examination of the Linux kernel IOMMU subsystem, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** While this commit fixes an inconsistency in `dev->iommu` state management, it addresses a **resource management and code cleanliness issue** rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit message explicitly states this is about keeping "dev->iommu state consistent" and mentions the current behavior is "benign (if a tiny bit wasteful)". The fix ensures cleanup "undoes precisely whatever it did." 2. **Code Analysis**: The changes add proper cleanup logic to free `dev->iommu` when `of_iommu_configure()` fails after allocating it via `iommu_fwspec_init()`. The key changes are: - Adding `dev_iommu_free()` declaration to the private header - Making `dev_iommu_free()` non-static - Adding conditional cleanup logic: `if (err && dev->iommu) dev_iommu_free(dev);` 3. **Security Context**: This occurs during device initialization/probe failure paths, not during normal device operation. The inconsistent state would only exist temporarily during error handling, and the commit notes it's currently "benign." 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - **CVE Status: YES** commits (Similar Commits 1&2) fix actual crashes ("potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable") - **CVE Status: NO** commits (Similar Commits 3-5) fix error handling, logging, and resource cleanup without security impact 5. **Impact Assessment**: This is a **resource leak fix** and **state consistency improvement**, not a security vulnerability. There's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or security boundary bypass. The commit improves code quality and prevents minor resource leaks during error conditions, but does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
969a38be437b6 phy: rockchip: usbdp: Only verify link rates/lanes/voltage when the corresponding set flags are set
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, this commit should be assigned: **NO** Here's my explanation: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a correctness fix that improves compliance with the PHY API documentation, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit ensures that link rates, lanes, and voltage are only verified/configured when their corresponding set flags (`set_rate`, `set_lanes`, `set_voltages`) are enabled. 2. **No security implications**: The changes: - Add proper conditional checks based on API flags - Store link_rate and lanes values in the udphy struct for later use - Change from using `dp->lanes` to `udphy->lanes` and `dp->link_rate` to `udphy->link_rate` in voltage configuration - These are all correctness improvements, not security fixes 3. **Similar patterns from reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - CVE Status: NO commits are mostly driver fixes, configuration improvements, or API compliance fixes - CVE Status: YES commit (Similar Commit 5) involved memory corruption due to incorrect use of `linkmode_set_bit()` with a bit mask instead of bit number 4. **No memory safety issues**: Unlike the CVE-worthy commit that had memory corruption, this commit doesn't involve: - Buffer overflows - Memory corruption - Access control bypasses - Input validation failures that could be exploited - Race conditions with security implications 5. **Documentation compliance**: The commit message explicitly states this is about following the PHY API documentation correctly, which indicates this is a correctness/compliance fix rather than a security fix. The code changes are straightforward refactoring to properly respect API flags and store values for later use - typical driver improvement work without security implications.
5f0ab2f35a437 wifi: iwlwifi: mark Br device not integrated
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific change being made in this commit. Based on my analysis: **Analysis of the Commit:** 1. **What the commit does:** - Removes `.integrated = true` from `iwl_br_trans_cfg` - Removes `.ltr_delay = IWL_CFG_TRANS_LTR_DELAY_2500US` from `iwl_br_trans_cfg` - This correctly marks the "Br" device as a discrete (non-integrated) device 2. **The problem being fixed:** - The "Br" device was incorrectly configured as integrated when it's actually discrete - When `ltr_delay` is set but `integrated` is false, the driver will trigger a `WARN_ON` in `iwl_set_soc_latency()` at line 88: `!WARN_ON(!fwrt->trans->trans_cfg->integrated)` - This WARN_ON would occur during device initialization when the SoC latency configuration is set 3. **Security implications:** - The WARN_ON could be triggered by simply loading the driver with a "Br" device - While WARN_ON doesn't crash the system by default, it could be used for denial of service if `panic_on_warn=1` is set - The warning would leak kernel information through stack traces - The kernel would be marked as tainted **CVE Assessment:** NO **Explanation:** This commit fixes a hardware configuration bug, not a security vulnerability. The specific issues are: 1. **Hardware Configuration Fix**: The commit correctly identifies that "Br" devices are discrete, not integrated, and removes incompatible configuration options. 2. **Prevents WARN_ON**: By removing the `ltr_delay` setting for discrete devices, it prevents the driver from triggering a WARN_ON during normal operation. 3. **No Security Impact**: - The WARN_ON would only occur during device initialization with specific hardware - It doesn't expose sensitive data or allow privilege escalation - It doesn't create memory corruption or other exploitable conditions - The fix is purely correcting hardware configuration parameters 4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This is very similar to the other iwlwifi configuration commits in the examples, all of which were marked "CVE Status: NO" - they deal with hardware device configuration rather than security vulnerabilities. This is a routine hardware support fix that prevents an incorrect warning condition, similar to the other iwlwifi commits provided as examples.
a52067c24ccf6 timer_list: Don't use %pK through printk()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the historical context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Being Fixed**: This commit is not fixing a security vulnerability but rather improving code quality and avoiding potential issues. The commit message explicitly states this is about switching from `%pK` to `%p` for better safety and simplicity, not fixing an active security bug. 2. **Hardening Improvement, Not Vulnerability Fix**: The commit is part of ongoing kernel hardening efforts to improve pointer formatting consistency. The author notes that since commit ad67b74d2469 (2017), regular `%p` already hashes addresses to prevent information leakage, making `%pK` redundant in this context. 3. **No Actual Exploitation Risk**: The change is from `%pK` (restricted pointers) to `%p` (hashed pointers). Both formats prevent raw kernel address leakage to unprivileged users. There's no indication that the previous `%pK` usage was actually leaking information or causing security issues. 4. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: All 5 similar commits provided as references (dealing with %pK to %p changes) are marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of pointer formatting improvement is not considered a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment. 5. **Preventive Rather Than Reactive**: The commit mentions potential issues with `%pK` in atomic contexts and sleeping locks, but these are theoretical concerns being addressed proactively, not actual vulnerabilities being exploited. This is a code quality and consistency improvement that enhances security posture but does not fix an exploitable vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
a9b56f219a0fa wifi: rtw89: set force HE TB mode when connecting to 11ax AP
- [sasha] Let me examine what similar commits in our examples look like to understand the security context: Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, let me provide my security assessment: **NO** This commit does not appear to warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a compatibility/interoperability fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message clearly states it's addressing an issue where "Some of 11ax AP set the UL HE-SIG-A2 reserved subfield to all 0s, which will cause the 11be chip to recognize trigger frame as EHT." 2. **Code functionality**: The new `rtw89_mac_set_he_tb()` function: - Only affects BE generation chips (`RTW89_CHIP_BE`) - Sets/clears a register bit (`B_BE_TRIG_DIS_EHTTB`) based on BSS configuration - The logic is: set the bit when connected to HE-only APs (not EHT-capable) to force HE TB mode - This is a protocol layer workaround for AP compatibility, not a security fix 3. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflow fixes - No memory leak fixes - No access control changes - No input validation improvements - No privilege escalation fixes - The register manipulation appears to be standard hardware configuration 4. **Comparison with examples**: Looking at the similar commits, those marked as "CVE Status: NO" have similar characteristics - they are driver improvements, compatibility fixes, or minor corrections that don't address security vulnerabilities. The one marked "CVE Status: YES" was a null pointer handling fix that prevented crashes. 5. **Impact assessment**: This change improves wireless protocol compatibility but doesn't fix any vulnerability that could be exploited for security purposes. The commit appears to be a legitimate protocol compatibility enhancement rather than a security fix.
a36230aa5f5ef wifi: rtw89: coex: Fix coexistence report not show as expected
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide an assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a logic error in coexistence reporting functionality for RTW89 WiFi drivers. The changes are: 1. **Removed premature `break` statements**: In the `_chk_btc_report()` function, the code removed `break` statements from version 7 and 8 case branches in a switch statement. This was preventing the `pcinfo->req_fver = ver->fcxbtcrpt;` assignment from being executed for these versions, causing the report version to not be set correctly. 2. **Added counter increment**: Added `pfwinfo->cnt_c2h++;` to count C2H event reports. **Why this doesn't warrant a CVE:** - **No security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix for debugging/monitoring functionality, not a security issue - **Limited scope**: The bug only affects coexistence reporting between WiFi and Bluetooth, which is diagnostic information - **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The malfunction would only result in incorrect parsing of diagnostic reports - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities - **Similar pattern to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the reference commits (all marked CVE Status: NO) which are also functional fixes for WiFi driver reporting/debugging features The fix ensures proper version matching between driver and firmware for diagnostic reports, which is purely a functional improvement rather than a security fix.
8b6861390ffee netfilter: conntrack: Bound nf_conntrack sysctl writes
- [sasha] Now I have enough context. Let me analyze the security implications: ## Analysis Based on my examination of the commit and the kernel source code, I can now provide a comprehensive analysis: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes an input validation issue in sysctl parameter handling but does not qualify for a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit adds proper bounds checking to two netfilter sysctl parameters (`nf_conntrack_max` and `nf_conntrack_expect_max`) by changing from `proc_dointvec` to `proc_dointvec_minmax` with appropriate bounds (SYSCTL_ZERO to SYSCTL_INT_MAX for the first, SYSCTL_ONE to SYSCTL_INT_MAX for the second). 2. **Variables Are Unsigned Int**: From the source code analysis: - `nf_conntrack_max` is declared as `unsigned int nf_conntrack_max __read_mostly;` (line 205 in nf_conntrack_core.c) - `nf_ct_expect_max` is declared as `unsigned int nf_ct_expect_max __read_mostly;` (line 41 in nf_conntrack_expect.c) 3. **Impact Assessment**: While negative values could be written and would wrap to very large unsigned values, this: - Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root privileges to write to these sysctls - Would primarily affect resource allocation limits within the netfilter subsystem - Does not create memory corruption, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation opportunities - Is a configuration robustness issue rather than a security vulnerability 4. **Similar to Reference Commit 1**: This is very similar to "Similar Commit 1" (core_pipe_limit fix) which was marked "CVE Status: NO". Both involve adding bounds checking to prevent negative values being written to unsigned variables used for resource limits. 5. **Administrative Control Required**: The vulnerability requires administrative privileges to exploit, and the impact is limited to potentially causing resource exhaustion within the netfilter subsystem rather than compromising system security. While this is a legitimate bug fix that improves system robustness, it falls into the category of hardening improvement rather than a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
5f2909c6cd135 posix-timers: Add cond_resched() to posix_timer_add() search loop
- [sasha] Let me examine the commit message more carefully and analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** 1. **Issue**: The commit fixes a potential soft lockup in `posix_timer_add()` when there are a large number of POSIX timers on PREEMPT_NONE/VOLUNTARY kernels. 2. **Code change**: Adds `cond_resched()` in the timer ID search loop (line 188 in the new code) that iterates up to INT_MAX times. 3. **Security implications**: - **Denial of Service**: Without `cond_resched()`, a user could potentially create enough POSIX timers to cause the kernel to loop for a very long time without yielding, leading to a soft lockup - **System availability**: This could make the system unresponsive, affecting all users - **Privilege escalation potential**: An unprivileged user could potentially DoS the system by exhausting timer IDs 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar Commits 2 & 3 were assigned CVE status for identical fixes (adding `cond_resched()` to prevent soft lockups in ftrace) - The pattern is identical: a loop that can run for a long time without yielding in kernel space 5. **Attack vector**: A malicious user could create many POSIX timers to force the kernel into this expensive search loop, causing a denial of service. **NO** While this commit fixes a potential soft lockup issue that could be exploited for denial of service, it appears to be more of a system robustness fix rather than a direct security vulnerability. The issue requires a user to have the ability to create a very large number of POSIX timers, and the impact is limited to system responsiveness rather than privilege escalation or information disclosure. However, given that similar `cond_resched()` fixes in ftrace were assigned CVEs, there is precedent for considering such fixes security-relevant. The key difference may be in the specific attack surface and ease of exploitation.
247e84f66a3d1 net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: Validate GRF and peripheral GRF during probe
- [sasha] Now let me look at the commit more carefully. Let me create a summary analysis based on my findings. **CVE ANALYSIS:** Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can now provide a security assessment: ## Key Changes Made by this Commit: 1. **Added `php_grf_required` field** to the `rk_gmac_ops` structure to identify which SoCs require both GRF and PHP GRF 2. **Moved GRF validation from deferred to probe time** - previously GRF validation occurred when accessing interface/speed functions 3. **Added early validation** with proper error handling using `dev_err_probe()` and `ERR_CAST()` 4. **Added conditional PHP GRF validation** only for SoCs that require it (RK3576 and RK3588) ## Security Analysis: This commit **does NOT fix a security vulnerability**. Here's why: ### 1. **Nature of Changes:** - This is purely a **code reorganization/improvement** that moves validation from runtime to probe time - No actual security bug was being fixed - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation issues addressed ### 2. **GRF/PHP GRF Context:** - GRF (General Register Files) and PHP GRF are **hardware configuration registers** for controlling MAC interface modes, speeds, and delays - These are **legitimate hardware access patterns** for network controller initialization - Access is already **properly controlled through syscon regmap APIs** ### 3. **Impact Assessment:** - **Before:** Validation occurred during MAC setup (deferred) - **After:** Validation occurs during probe (immediate) - **Result:** Earlier error detection, no security impact ### 4. **Comparison to Reference CVE Examples:** - **Unlike Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES):** That fixed actual resource leaks in error paths - **Like Similar Commits 2-5 (CVE: NO):** This is driver cleanup/improvement work ### 5. **No Security-Relevant Patterns:** - No buffer overflow fixes - No memory leak fixes - No access control changes - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation fixes **CVE Status: NO** This commit improves driver robustness by providing better error handling and earlier failure detection, but it does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously.
81f8f7454ad9e RDMA/uverbs: Propagate errors from rdma_lookup_get_uobject()
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have the complete picture. Let me analyze this commit: ## Analysis This commit changes error handling in the RDMA uverbs subsystem. Previously, when `uobj_get_obj_read()` failed (which internally calls `rdma_lookup_get_uobject()`), it would return `NULL`, and the calling code would convert this to `-EINVAL`. Now, the actual error code from `rdma_lookup_get_uobject()` is preserved and returned. ### Key Security Implications: 1. **Information Disclosure**: The commit message specifically mentions that `ibv_modify_qp` failing with `EBUSY` (when retrieving QP uobject) would show the overridden error code `EINVAL` instead of the actual `EBUSY`. This is an **information leak** where the kernel reveals internal state information that could be used by attackers. 2. **Error Code Masking**: The change reveals that previously, ALL errors were being masked as `EINVAL`, including potentially sensitive ones like: - `EBUSY` (resource contention/locking state) - `ENOENT` (object doesn't exist) - `EIO` (device state issues) - `EPERM` (permission issues) 3. **Looking at the code changes**: The commit changes from: ```c if (!pd) { ret = -EINVAL; // Always EINVAL regardless of actual error ``` to: ```c if (IS_ERR(pd)) { ret = PTR_ERR(pd); // Reveals actual error code ``` 4. **Attack Surface**: From the lookup function (`uverbs_try_lock_object`), I can see it returns `-EBUSY` when there are locking conflicts. This reveals kernel internal locking state to userspace applications. ### Comparison with Similar CVE-worthy Commits: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES": - Similar Commit 1: NULL pointer dereference prevention - Similar Commit 2: Resource leak fix - Similar Commit 3: NULL pointer dereference fix - Similar Commit 4: NULL check addition - Similar Commit 5: Integer overflow prevention This commit is different - it's about **information disclosure through error code revelation** rather than memory safety. **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. While it changes error handling behavior and reveals previously masked internal error codes, this is actually improving the debugging experience as intended by the developers and documented in the commit message. The commit references rdma-core commit indicating that kernel error codes are either ignored or passed through anyway. This is not a security vulnerability but rather a debugging/usability improvement that provides more accurate error reporting to applications without creating any exploitable condition.
e856f93e0fb24 ext4: do not convert the unwritten extents if data writeback fails
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of the commit message, code changes, and related kernel code, I can now provide my assessment. **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Information Disclosure to Unauthorized Users**: The commit prevents stale data exposure only in very specific scenarios where physical block writes fail but reads succeed. The stale data would only be accessible to the same process/user that originally had access to the file content. This is not a privilege escalation or unauthorized access vulnerability. 2. **Limited Impact Scope**: The issue only affects the dioread_nolock feature (default in ext4) when: - A write operation fails at the physical block level (returns -EIO) - But reads from the same blocks succeed - AND the unwritten extent gets incorrectly converted to written despite the write failure 3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The "stale data" mentioned refers to previously written data by the same user/process to the same file. This is not exposing data across security boundaries (between different users, processes, or privilege levels). 4. **Consistency/Integrity Issue, Not Security**: The core problem is a filesystem consistency issue where metadata incorrectly marks blocks as written when the write actually failed. This could lead to data corruption or inconsistent file state, but not to security vulnerabilities. 5. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this commit follows the same pattern of filesystem integrity/consistency fixes rather than security vulnerability fixes. The commit message explicitly describes this as preventing "stale data exposure" in edge cases, but the context shows this is about maintaining filesystem consistency rather than preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
2389c6efd3ad8 posix-timers: Ensure that timer initialization is fully visible
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and the commit, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a memory ordering race condition that could lead to an incompletely initialized timer being accessed, but it does not appear to constitute a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment. **Analysis:** 1. **Race Condition Nature**: The race condition is between timer initialization in `do_timer_create()` and timer access in `__lock_timer()`. Thread T0 writes timer fields (step A) and then writes `it_signal` to validate the timer (step B), while Thread T1 can observe the valid `it_signal` (step B) without guaranteeing visibility of the earlier initialization (step A). 2. **Impact Assessment**: The potential consequences are: - Accessing incompletely initialized timer fields when a timer operation (gettime, settime, getoverrun, delete) is called immediately after timer creation - This could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect timer operations - However, this is primarily a race condition affecting correctness, not a clear security vulnerability 3. **Security Context**: - The race window is very small (between timer creation and immediate access) - All timer operations require proper ownership (timer must belong to current process/thread) - Access controls are maintained (via `it_signal == current->signal` check) - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access control bypass is evident 4. **Fix Nature**: The fix uses proper memory barriers (acquiring `it_lock` before writing `it_signal`) to ensure complete visibility of timer initialization before the timer becomes valid. This is a correctness fix for a concurrency issue. 5. **Comparison to Historical Examples**: The similar commits provided all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with race conditions, initialization issues, and correctness fixes rather than security vulnerabilities. While this bug could cause unpredictable behavior in timer operations under specific timing conditions, it does not cross the threshold of being a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
be2f92844d0f8 leds: Kconfig: leds-st1202: Add select for required LEDS_TRIGGER_PATTERN
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase, I can now provide a definitive assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a Kconfig dependency fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit adds `select LEDS_TRIGGER_PATTERN` to the LEDS_ST1202 configuration to ensure a required dependency is properly selected. 2. **Impact Analysis**: The missing dependency would result in: - Build failures or functionality gaps where `hw_pattern` sysfs interface wouldn't be available - No way to interact with the hardware pattern functionality from userspace - This is a **functionality issue**, not a security issue 3. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the ST1202 driver code, it: - Uses `led_cdev.pattern_set` and `led_cdev.pattern_clear` callbacks (lines 273-274) - Sets `led_cdev.default_trigger = "pattern"` (line 275) - Implements hardware pattern functionality for LED control - The missing LEDS_TRIGGER_PATTERN would prevent the pattern trigger from being available, breaking the intended functionality 4. **Security Implications**: None. This is purely a build/functionality dependency issue: - No memory safety issues - No privilege escalation risks - No input validation problems - No access control bypasses - No information disclosure 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - they are configuration fixes, dependency additions, or minor build improvements without security implications. The commit message explicitly states this is about ensuring proper functionality ("there would be no way of interacting with the driver and hardware from user space") rather than fixing any security vulnerability. This is a standard dependency fix to ensure proper driver functionality.
a17d9e736ddd7 leds: leds-st1202: Initialize hardware before DT node child operations
- [sasha] Now I have a complete picture. Let me analyze this commit: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit is a code reorganization/improvement that changes the order of two initialization functions in the probe routine. Specifically, it switches the order so that `st1202_setup()` (hardware initialization) runs before `st1202_dt_init()` (device tree parsing and LED structure setup). **Key observations:** 1. **No security vulnerability fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is an optimization - "there are more chances of errors occurring during the initialization of the hardware, so this should complete successfully before the devicetree node's children are initialized." 2. **Functional equivalence**: The commit message confirms "Real-world testing corroborates that calling st1202_setup() before st1202_dt_init() doesn't cause any issue during initialization." This indicates both orders work functionally. 3. **No security-sensitive changes**: - No access control modifications - No buffer overflow fixes - No input validation changes - No race condition fixes (that was addressed in the previous commit c72e455b89f2) - No privilege escalation concerns 4. **Context from previous commit**: The immediately preceding commit (c72e455b89f2) fixed an actual race condition/NULL pointer vulnerability by moving LED registration to the end of probe. This current commit is a follow-up optimization. 5. **Code pattern**: This matches the "CVE Status: NO" similar commits that involve code reorganization, function call reordering, or initialization sequence improvements without fixing actual vulnerabilities. The change improves initialization robustness by performing hardware setup before software structure setup, but doesn't fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited.
26343ca0df715 ext4: reject the 'data_err=abort' option in nojournal mode
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Security Analysis:** 1. **No vulnerability fix**: This commit adds input validation to reject an invalid configuration combination (`data_err=abort` without a journal), rather than fixing a security vulnerability. 2. **Configuration validation, not exploit prevention**: The code prevents mounting with meaningless options that would have no effect anyway. The `data_err=abort` option is designed to abort the journal on I/O errors, but without a journal, this option has no purpose. 3. **No security boundary crossed**: The commit doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security issues. It simply improves configuration validation. 4. **Consistent with similar commits**: Looking at the provided reference commits, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar configuration validation and error handling improvements in ext4, none of which were considered security vulnerabilities. **Code Analysis:** - The changes in `fs/ext4/super.c:2775-2778` and `fs/ext4/super.c:5423-5427` add validation checks that reject invalid mount options - No memory access patterns, buffer operations, or security-sensitive code paths are modified - The functionality is purely defensive programming to prevent invalid configurations **Context from kernel tree:** The `data_err=abort` option is used to abort the journal when data I/O errors occur (as seen in `fs/ext4/page-io.c:196`). Without a journal (`EXT4_SB(sb)->s_journal` would be NULL), calling `jbd2_journal_abort()` would be meaningless or potentially problematic. This commit prevents that invalid configuration from being accepted. This is a hardening/validation improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
19478f2011f8b drm/amdgpu: Update SRIOV video codec caps
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit without the kernel tree access. Based on the commit message and code changes provided: ## Analysis **Commit Summary:** - Subject: "drm/amdgpu: Update SRIOV video codec caps" - Purpose: Updates SRIOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) video codec capabilities with correct values - Files modified: `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/nv.c` and `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/soc21.c` **Code Changes Analysis:** 1. **Type of Changes**: The commit updates video codec capability definitions for SRIOV configurations 2. **Specific Changes**: - In `nv.c`: Updates resolution limits for MPEG2, MPEG4, VC1 (from 4096x4096 to 1920x1088) and JPEG (from 4096x4096 to 16384x16384) - In `soc21.c`: Removes support for MPEG2, MPEG4, and VC1 codecs entirely from SRIOV configurations and updates JPEG resolution (from 4096x4096 to 16384x16384) 3. **Security Implications Assessment**: - These changes are purely **capability/configuration updates** for video codec specifications - They correct previously incorrect video resolution limits and codec support declarations - No memory management, access control, input validation, or privilege escalation code is involved - The changes are declarative data structure updates, not functional code changes 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - All 5 similar commits provided were marked "CVE Status: NO" - They all involve similar video codec capability corrections - Similar pattern: updating codec resolution limits and capabilities - These are hardware specification corrections, not security fixes 5. **Security Vulnerability Assessment**: - **No buffer overflow fixes**: These are static capability declarations - **No memory leak fixes**: No memory allocation/deallocation code - **No access control changes**: Only capability specifications - **No input validation improvements**: No input processing code - **No race condition fixes**: No concurrency-related code - **No privilege escalation fixes**: No security privilege code **Conclusion:** **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a straightforward configuration update that corrects video codec capability specifications for SRIOV environments. The changes are purely declarative updates to static data structures that define hardware capabilities, not fixes for security vulnerabilities. The commit message explicitly states it's updating "correct values" for video caps, indicating this is a hardware specification correction rather than a security fix. All similar commits in the reference examples were also marked as not requiring CVEs, establishing a clear pattern that such video codec capability updates are maintenance changes, not security fixes.
cdbbc480f4146 clk: qcom: lpassaudiocc-sc7280: Add support for LPASS resets for QCM6490
- [sasha] Now I understand the changes. Let me analyze this commit: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit adds support for LPASS (Low Power Audio SubSystem) resets for the QCM6490 platform. Here's what the changes do: 1. **New regmap configuration** (lines 717-725): Creates a dedicated regmap config specifically for reset functionality with a proper name and limited register range (max 0xc8). 2. **Updated device match table** (lines 732-735): Adds support for QCM6490 devices ("qcom,qcm6490-lpassaudiocc") that only need reset functionality, mapping them to the reset-only descriptor. 3. **Modified probe function** (lines 766-769): Adds a special case for QCM6490 that bypasses the full clock controller setup and only initializes reset functionality using `qcom_cc_probe_by_index` with index 1. 4. **Preserved existing functionality**: The original SC7280 support remains unchanged - it still sets up both clocks and resets. ## Security Assessment This is **not a security fix** but rather a **feature addition** that: - **Adds new platform support**: Extends the driver to support QCM6490 boards - **Reduces attack surface**: For QCM6490, it actually provides *less* functionality (resets only, no clocks) since the LPASS firmware controls clocks on that platform - **No vulnerability patterns**: The changes don't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, race conditions, or privilege escalation bugs - **No security implications mentioned**: The commit message focuses purely on hardware support and firmware architecture differences The changes are straightforward platform-specific extensions that allow the Audio SW driver to control resets on QCM6490 while the LPASS firmware handles clocks. This is an architectural requirement, not a security fix. This commit pattern is very similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - all of which were hardware support additions or platform-specific improvements without security implications.
fb3bbc46c94f2 mmc: sdhci: Disable SD card clock before changing parameters
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit in detail: **CVE Analysis:** **NO** **Explanation:** This commit addresses a **functional/compatibility issue** rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a "spurious clock pulse" issue that occurs during voltage switching with specific hardware (Baytrail and Apollo Lake SD controllers) and a specific Swissbit SD card. This is a hardware compatibility problem, not a security flaw. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - **Before**: The code immediately wrote `0` to `SDHCI_CLOCK_CONTROL`, completely disabling the clock - **After**: The code first checks if the card clock is enabled (`SDHCI_CLOCK_CARD_EN`) and only disables the external card clock, preserving other clock settings 3. **Security Impact Assessment**: - **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes don't involve buffer overflows, memory corruption, or access control - **No Privilege Escalation**: There's no change in access permissions or privilege levels - **No Information Disclosure**: The issue doesn't leak sensitive information - **No Denial of Service**: While voltage switching failure could cause card malfunction, this is a functional issue, not a security DoS 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked as "CVE Status: NO") are also functional fixes for MMC/SD controllers addressing: - Timing issues during PM transitions - Clock rate setting problems - Compatibility regressions - Tuning parameter corrections 5. **Specification Compliance**: The fix ensures compliance with SD Host Controller Specification v4.20 §3.2.3, making it a correctness/compliance fix rather than a security patch. 6. **Impact Scope**: The issue only affects voltage switching with specific hardware combinations and doesn't create system-wide vulnerabilities or expose attack vectors. The spurious clock pulse issue is a functional problem that breaks voltage switching with certain hardware, but it doesn't create exploitable security vulnerabilities that would warrant CVE assignment.
76b58d5111fdc mfd: tps65219: Remove TPS65219_REG_TI_DEV_ID check
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the commit. Let me analyze this for security implications. ## Analysis Summary Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Being Fixed**: The commit removes a device ID register read that was never actually validating the chip identity. The code was reading the `TPS65219_REG_TI_DEV_ID` register but was not comparing it against any expected value - it was just checking if the I2C read operation succeeded. 2. **Functional, Not Security Change**: According to the commit message, the device ID register values are inconsistent across different NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) configurations of the TPS65219 PMIC family. The removal improves code correctness by eliminating a meaningless check rather than fixing a security issue. 3. **No Access Control or Validation Logic Removed**: The original code pattern was: ```c ret = regmap_read(tps->regmap, TPS65219_REG_TI_DEV_ID, &chipid); if (ret) { dev_err(tps->dev, "Failed to read device ID: %d\n", ret); return ret; } ``` This only checked if the I2C communication was successful, not if the device was actually the expected PMIC. 4. **Device Identification Still Present**: The driver still uses proper device identification through the device tree matching mechanism (`i2c_get_match_data(client)`) and chip-specific configuration tables. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as similar commits in the reference list (particularly Similar Commits 1 and 2) which make device identification corrections without security implications. The commit improves code quality by removing dead code that was not providing any meaningful validation, rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
ba09916efb29f mfd: syscon: Add check for invalid resource size
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the vulnerability. Regmap uses `map->max_register` to validate register access bounds. When the integer underflow occurs, regmap believes there's a massive valid address space, bypassing critical bounds checking. **CVE ASSESSMENT:** **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes an integer underflow that occurs when `resource_size(&res) < reg_io_width`, causing `max_register` to wrap around to a very large value (e.g., 4294967294 instead of -2). 2. **Impact**: This creates a massive perceived address space in regmap, allowing potential out-of-bounds memory access beyond the actual mapped syscon region, which could lead to: - Memory corruption - Information disclosure - Potential privilege escalation if syscon controls sensitive hardware registers 3. **Attack Vector**: An attacker with the ability to provide malformed device tree data (common in embedded systems) could trigger this vulnerability by specifying a resource size smaller than the register width. 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: This is similar to "Similar Commit 2" which got a CVE for fixing a null pointer dereference in syscon. This integer underflow bug has potentially more severe security implications than a simple null pointer dereference. 5. **Code Evidence**: Lines 100-104 in the fix show the addition of a bounds check specifically to prevent `res_size < reg_io_width`, demonstrating this was a real security concern that could be exploited. The fix properly validates that the resource size is at least as large as the register width before performing the subtraction, preventing the integer underflow and the resulting security vulnerability.
a149377c033af ASoC: sun4i-codec: support hp-det-gpios property
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, examining both the code changes and the broader security implications: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Security Analysis:** 1. **Nature of Changes**: This commit adds a new feature (headphone detection via GPIO) rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. It introduces support for the `hp-det-gpios` device tree property. 2. **Static Variables Are Standard Pattern**: While the code uses static variables (`sun4i_headphone_jack`, `sun4i_headphone_jack_gpio`), this is a common and accepted pattern in ALSA/ASoC drivers for machine-level audio components. Many similar drivers in the kernel use this same pattern. 3. **GPIO Handling is Secure**: The GPIO acquisition uses `devm_gpiod_get_optional()` with proper error handling and `GPIOD_IN` flag, which is appropriate for input detection. 4. **Proper Resource Management**: The GPIO is managed via the `devm_` API, ensuring automatic cleanup when the device is removed. 5. **No Vulnerability Being Fixed**: The commit message and code changes show this is purely adding new functionality, not fixing any security issues. **Comparison with Similar Commits:** Looking at the provided reference commits, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar audio subsystem changes (GPIO property additions, device tree binding updates, hardware support improvements). This commit follows the same pattern - it's a feature addition rather than a security fix. **Code Security Assessment:** - No buffer overflows being addressed - No memory leaks being fixed - No access control vulnerabilities - No privilege escalation issues - No race conditions being resolved - No input validation problems being corrected This is a straightforward feature enhancement that adds GPIO-based headphone detection capability to the sun4i audio codec driver, following established kernel patterns.
05fd00e5e7b1a net: hsr: Fix PRP duplicate detection
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the Linux kernel HSR/PRP implementation, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Protocol Correctness Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes PRP duplicate detection logic to properly handle packet reordering due to L2 802.1p prioritization. This is fundamentally a protocol implementation bug rather than a security vulnerability. 2. **Limited Scope and Impact**: - Only affects industrial networks using the specialized PRP (Parallel Redundancy Protocol) - The issue causes legitimate frames to be incorrectly dropped due to sequence number handling - Does not lead to system compromise, privilege escalation, or information disclosure 3. **No Exploitable Security Weakness**: - Cannot be leveraged for remote code execution - Does not bypass authentication or access controls - Does not expose sensitive data - Limited to network layer protocol behavior 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involve actual use-after-free vulnerabilities (memory safety issues) - This commit is more similar to the "CVE Status: NO" examples that fix protocol logic without security implications 5. **Nature of the Fix**: The code changes add PRP-specific duplicate detection logic with new fields (`seq_expected`, `seq_start`) and a sophisticated windowing algorithm. This improves protocol correctness rather than fixing a security flaw. The commit addresses a functional issue where network switches performing L2 prioritization could cause legitimate PRP frames to be dropped due to reordering, but this represents a bug in protocol implementation rather than a security vulnerability warranting CVE assignment.
c12bfa0fee659 pinctrl-tegra: Restore SFSEL bit when freeing pins
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit in detail: **Analysis:** **NO** This commit addresses a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes pin state management where pins were being incorrectly restored to SFIO mode regardless of their original state when `pinctrl_gpio_free()` is called. This causes "glitches" on pins that should remain in GPIO mode. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Adds a new `tegra_pingroup_config` structure with `is_sfsel` boolean to track original pin state - In `tegra_pinctrl_gpio_request_enable()`: Stores the original SFSEL bit state before clearing it - In `tegra_pinctrl_gpio_disable_free()`: Restores the pin to its original state instead of always setting SFIO mode - Memory allocation for the config array in `tegra_pinctrl_probe()` 3. **Security Impact Assessment**: - No memory safety issues (proper bounds checking, allocation) - No privilege escalation concerns - No input validation vulnerabilities - No race conditions introduced - The "glitches" mentioned are electrical signal integrity issues, not security vulnerabilities 4. **Comparison to Similar CVE-assigned Commit**: The one CVE-assigned commit in the examples (Similar Commit 5) involved a "sleeping function called from invalid context" bug that could cause system instability - a more serious issue than pin state restoration. This is a hardware functionality bug fix that improves signal integrity but does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities that would warrant CVE assignment.
ae5f76d4044d1 ASoC: sun4i-codec: correct dapm widgets and controls for h616
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis, this commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Pure hardware compatibility fix**: The commit removes a redundant LINEOUT control and adds proper Speaker/Headphone widgets to correctly describe the H616 SoC's audio routing capabilities. This is a hardware abstraction improvement, not a security fix. 2. **No security-relevant code changes**: The modifications only involve ALSA/ASoC framework widget definitions: - `SOC_DAPM_PIN_SWITCH("Speaker")` - standard ALSA control macro - `SND_SOC_DAPM_HP("Headphone", NULL)` - standard DAPM widget definition - These use well-tested framework functions with built-in bounds checking 3. **No vulnerability patterns**: The changes don't address any of the typical security vulnerability patterns like buffer overflows, memory leaks, input validation issues, race conditions, or privilege escalation. 4. **Functionality enhancement only**: The commit message clearly states this is to "correct dapm widgets and controls" for better hardware support, specifically mentioning external components like "headphone jack detection switch" and "GPIO-controlled speaker amplifier" - these are standard audio hardware features. 5. **Consistent with similar commits**: All provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - they are hardware enablement, driver improvements, or feature additions without security implications. This is standard Linux audio subsystem maintenance work to properly support H616 SoC audio hardware, not a security fix requiring CVE assignment.
bfc6c67ec2d64 net/smc: use the correct ndev to find pnetid by pnetid table
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit by comparing the changes with the examples provided: **Analysis:** **NO** This commit is a functional improvement rather than a security fix. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit extends the pnetid (physical network ID) lookup logic to search in both `base_ndev` and the original `ndev` when determining RDMA device mappings for SMC (Shared Memory Communications) in container environments. 2. **Code analysis**: - Line 1089: Adds `smc_pnet_find_ndev_pnetid_by_table(base_ndev, ndev_pnetid) &&` - Line 1090: Adds `smc_pnet_find_ndev_pnetid_by_table(ndev, ndev_pnetid)` - This creates a fallback mechanism: try base_ndev first, then try ndev if base_ndev fails 3. **Security implications**: None identified. The changes: - Don't fix memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control issues - Don't address privilege escalation or input validation vulnerabilities - Don't fix NULL pointer dereferences or race conditions - The commit message doesn't mention any security concerns or vulnerabilities 4. **Comparison with CVE examples**: - Unlike Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) which fixed a NULL pointer dereference - Unlike Similar Commit 3&4 (CVE: YES) which addressed locking pressure/DoS potential - More similar to Similar Commit 1&5 (CVE: NO) which were functional bug fixes 5. **Purpose**: This is purely a functional enhancement to support different container networking topologies (host network, IPVLAN, veth) by expanding the search scope for pnetid configuration, improving SMC-R compatibility in containerized environments. The change extends existing functionality without introducing or fixing security vulnerabilities.
fc3c139cf0432 drm/amdgpu/gfx12: don't read registers in mqd init
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific changes in the commit: **CVE Analysis Decision: NO** **Explanation:** This commit changes the MQD (Memory Queue Descriptor) initialization in the GFX12 driver from reading hardware registers (`RREG32_SOC15()`) to using predefined default values. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit is a preventive optimization rather than a security vulnerability fix. The commit message states "There's not need to get the value from hardware and it could cause problems if we do that at runtime and gfxoff is active." 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - Replaces `RREG32_SOC15(GC, 0, regCP_GFX_MQD_CONTROL)` with `regCP_GFX_MQD_CONTROL_DEFAULT` - Similar replacements for multiple registers (8 total register reads replaced) - Adds hardcoded default values as `#define` constants 3. **Security Assessment**: - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or bounds checking problems - **No access control changes**: The defaults maintain the same security properties (VMID=0, PRIV_STATE=1) - **No input validation changes**: This is internal initialization code, not user-facing - **No privilege escalation**: The changes maintain the same privilege levels in the hardware configuration 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The provided examples show similar optimization commits (like the MES pipe FW version fetching optimizations) that were correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern of avoiding unnecessary hardware reads. 5. **Root Cause**: The issue being fixed is a **race condition/timing problem** with GFXOFF power management, not a security vulnerability. When GFXOFF is active, reading certain registers may return stale or incorrect values, potentially causing functional issues but not security exploits. 6. **Impact**: The potential problems mentioned would likely manifest as GPU hangs, incorrect initialization, or driver stability issues - not security vulnerabilities that could be exploited maliciously. This is a reliability and robustness improvement that prevents potential hardware read issues during power management state transitions, but does not fix a security vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
e27b36ea6ba5f drm/amdgpu/gfx11: don't read registers in mqd init
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is primarily a stability/reliability improvement that prevents hardware hangs and system issues when reading registers during power state transitions (when gfxoff is active). 2. **Similar pattern to non-CVE commits**: This commit follows the same pattern as the provided examples (commits 1 and 2) that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - both of those also optimized register fetching to avoid reading from hardware during problematic states. 3. **No clear security vulnerability**: While the commit prevents potential race conditions and ensures consistent initialization, there's no indication of: - Buffer overflows - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Exploitable information disclosure - Input validation bypasses 4. **Defensive programming**: The changes replace runtime register reads with known-good default values to ensure predictable behavior. This is good defensive programming but doesn't indicate an existing exploitable vulnerability. 5. **Hardware reliability focus**: The commit message emphasizes avoiding "problems" during gfxoff state, which suggests hardware reliability concerns rather than security vulnerabilities. The commit improves robustness by eliminating dependency on potentially unreliable hardware state during power transitions, but this appears to be a proactive stability improvement rather than a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability.
226ac19c217f2 kconfig: do not clear SYMBOL_VALID when reading include/config/auto.conf
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit: ## CVE Analysis **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ### What the commit does: 1. **Optimizes kconfig processing**: When reading `include/config/auto.conf` (via `S_DEF_AUTO`), the code no longer clears `SYMBOL_VALID` flags or calls `expr_invalidate_all()` 2. **Reduces unnecessary work**: The change prevents invalidation and recalculation of all symbol values when they don't need to be modified 3. **Preserves correctness**: Only skips the invalidation/recalculation for `S_DEF_AUTO` case, still does it for `S_DEF_USER` ### Security implications: 1. **No security boundary crossed**: This is purely an optimization in the kconfig build system 2. **No memory safety issues**: The change doesn't involve buffer operations, memory allocation/deallocation, or pointer manipulation that could cause overflows or corruption 3. **No privilege changes**: Kconfig runs during kernel build time with the same privileges throughout 4. **No input validation bypassed**: The change doesn't affect how configuration data is parsed or validated 5. **No access control affected**: This doesn't change what files can be read or how they're processed from a security perspective ### Comparison with similar commits: Looking at the provided reference commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), this commit follows the same pattern: - **Similar Commit 1**: Code cleanup removing unreachable code - **Similar Commit 2**: Code refactoring/deduplication - **Similar Commit 3**: Build process fix moving function calls - **Similar Commit 4**: Warning message improvement - **Similar Commit 5**: Adding warning functionality This commit is an **optimization/performance improvement** in the build system, not a security fix. It reduces unnecessary computational work during kconfig processing without changing the fundamental behavior or introducing/fixing security vulnerabilities. The commit message explicitly states this is about avoiding "totally unneeded" work, confirming this is a performance optimization rather than a security fix.
2356f15caefc0 xen: Add support for XenServer 6.1 platform device
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** This commit is **not** a security vulnerability fix. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds support for a new PCI device ID (0x0002) alongside the existing one (0x0001) for XenServer 6.1 compatibility. This is purely an enhancement/compatibility fix, not a security fix. 2. **No Security Issue Being Fixed**: The code changes only add a new device ID to the `platform_pci_tbl[]` array. The actual security-critical initialization code (grant table setup, IRQ handling, memory allocation) remains completely unchanged. 3. **The "Crash" is Not a Security Vulnerability**: The crash mentioned in the commit message (`gnttab_expand+0x29/0x210`) occurs when Xen is detected but the platform device isn't found, causing grant table initialization to fail. This is: - A compatibility/availability issue, not a security issue - Not exploitable - it's a system initialization failure that prevents normal operation - Not a memory corruption or privilege escalation bug 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, the commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" involve actual functional fixes (like correcting IRQ release parameters in `unbind_from_irqhandler`), while those marked "CVE Status: NO" are feature additions or configuration changes, similar to this commit. 5. **Impact Assessment**: This fix prevents system crashes on XenServer 6.1 Windows environments by allowing the Linux guest to properly initialize. The lack of this fix causes system unavailability, not security breaches. The commit is a legitimate compatibility fix that prevents system crashes in specific Xen environments, but it doesn't address any security vulnerability.
f757f6011c92b kbuild: fix argument parsing in scripts/config
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific code changes and their security implications: ## Security Analysis: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ### 1. **Nature of the Fix** The commit fixes argument parsing logic in the `scripts/config` utility - specifically: - Previously: `--file` had to be the first argument - After: `--file` can appear anywhere in the argument list - Also fixes `--refresh` to respect the `--file` parameter ### 2. **Code Changes Analysis** Looking at the diff, the changes are: - **Lines 128-143**: Replace simple `if [ "$1" = "--file" ]` check with a `while` loop that scans all arguments - **Line 228**: Add `KCONFIG_CONFIG=$FN` to the `make oldconfig` command ### 3. **Security Impact Assessment** - **No buffer overflows**: The changes use proper bash array handling with `CMDS+=()` - **No privilege escalation**: The script operates on kernel configuration files, not system privileges - **No access control bypass**: This is a utility script for manipulating .config files - **No input validation issues**: The fix actually makes argument parsing more robust - **No memory corruption**: This is a bash script, not C code ### 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits** All the provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") are also build system/tooling improvements without security implications: - Refactoring variables in build scripts - Fixing file names in Makefiles - Making functions generally available - Parsing improvements ### 5. **Impact Scope** This affects a development/build-time utility script that kernel developers use to modify kernel configuration files. It doesn't affect runtime kernel security, user data, or system integrity. The fix improves usability and correctness but doesn't address any security vulnerability - it's a quality-of-life improvement for kernel developers.
4b82b181a26cf bpf: Allow pre-ordering for bpf cgroup progs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a feature enhancement rather than a security fix. The commit introduces a new `BPF_F_PREORDER` flag to allow BPF cgroup programs to execute in pre-order (top-to-bottom) instead of the default post-order (bottom-to-top) execution. 2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message clearly describes this as addressing a functional requirement at Meta where they need root cgroup programs to execute before child cgroup programs for data collection purposes. There's no mention of fixing a security vulnerability. 3. **Code changes analysis**: - Adds a new flag `BPF_F_PREORDER` (line +41 in include/uapi/linux/bpf.h) - Adds a `u32 flags` field to `struct bpf_prog_list` to store program flags - Modifies the program ordering logic in `compute_effective_progs()` to handle pre-ordering - Updates flag validation in `BPF_F_ATTACH_MASK_BASE` to include the new flag 4. **No security-sensitive patterns**: The changes don't involve: - Buffer overflow fixes - Memory leak fixes - Access control vulnerabilities - Input validation security issues - Race conditions with security implications - Privilege escalation fixes 5. **Comparison with reference commits**: Unlike the "YES" examples that fix actual security vulnerabilities (missing attach type enforcement allowing cgroup_skb progs to attach to wrong hooks), this commit adds legitimate functionality without fixing any security issue. The commit is purely functional, adding a new feature to control BPF program execution order in cgroup hierarchies for legitimate use cases, with no security implications.
45fc728515c14 dm: restrict dm device size to 2^63-512 bytes
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Code Analysis:** The commit adds a simple bounds check in `dm_table_add_target()`: ```c if (start + len < start || start + len > LLONG_MAX >> SECTOR_SHIFT) { DMERR("%s: too large device", dm_device_name(t->md)); return -EINVAL; } ``` **Key Findings:** 1. **Preventive Hardening, Not Vulnerability Fix**: This is a preventive measure to avoid potential userspace issues with `off_t` being a signed 64-bit integer, rather than fixing an actual exploitable kernel vulnerability. 2. **No Current Exploitable Condition**: The check prevents overflow (`start + len < start`) and enforces a reasonable maximum size limit (`LLONG_MAX >> SECTOR_SHIFT` = ~2^63-512 bytes). Without this check, there's no evidence of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other exploitable conditions. 3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar overflow prevention commits (like the dm-unstriped fix) received CVE assignments only when they fixed actual exploitable conditions - The similar dm limit commits in the reference set were marked "CVE Status: NO" 4. **Administrative Validation**: The commit adds input validation that returns `-EINVAL` for invalid parameters - this is standard defensive programming, not a security fix. 5. **No Security Context in Commit Message**: The commit message focuses on userspace compatibility with `off_t`, not security implications. This commit implements bounds checking to prevent potential issues but doesn't fix an existing exploitable vulnerability that could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
64b7871522a4c crypto: octeontx2 - suppress auth failure screaming due to negative tests
- [sasha] Let me analyze the security implications of this change: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit only changes the logging level from `dev_err` (always visible) to `pr_debug` (only visible when debug logging is enabled) for authentication failures during crypto operations. 2. **Security context**: The commit message specifically mentions this addresses "authentication failures being erroneously reported due to negative test failures in the 'ccm(aes)' selftest." This indicates these are expected failures during normal crypto algorithm testing, not actual security vulnerabilities. 3. **No functional security impact**: - The actual error handling logic remains unchanged - The function still returns proper error codes (`*res_code` is still set appropriately) - The authentication failure detection and response is unaffected - This only changes visibility of error messages, not error handling 4. **Operational improvement**: The change prevents log spam from expected test failures, which actually improves security monitoring by reducing noise that could mask real security issues. 5. **Pattern from similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all involve functional fixes (memory leaks, missing validation, configuration issues) rather than simple logging changes. None of the purely cosmetic or logging-related changes received CVEs. This is a quality-of-life improvement for system administrators and developers, reducing false alarms from legitimate testing operations, without any impact on the security posture of the system.
17fdf318f5fbe ASoC: pcm6240: Drop bogus code handling IRQ as GPIO
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it with the similar commits provided, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Code Quality Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes incorrect GPIO/IRQ API usage but doesn't address a security vulnerability. The original code was semantically wrong by treating an IRQ number as a GPIO number and calling GPIO functions on it, but this is a coding error rather than a security flaw. 2. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: This commit follows the exact same pattern as the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO": - Similar Commit 1 (tas2781): Also removed incorrect GPIO code that treated IRQs as GPIOs - Similar Commit 5 (tas2781): Fixed GPIO API misuse - All were marked as NOT requiring CVEs 3. **No Security Impact**: The changes show: - Removal of `gpio_request()`, `gpio_direction_input()`, and `gpio_to_irq()` calls on an IRQ number - Simplification to treat the IRQ properly as an IRQ - No evidence of buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issues 4. **API Misuse Cleanup**: The commit message explicitly states this is about fixing "bogus code" and API misuse - moving away from legacy GPIO APIs and fixing semantic incorrectness, not security issues. 5. **Driver Functionality**: The driver appears to work the same way after the fix, just with correct API usage. The IRQ is still obtained and used properly. This is a code quality and API correctness fix, similar to the reference commits that were correctly marked as not requiring CVEs.
0ec6bd16705fe ASoC: sma1307: Add NULL check in sma1307_setting_loaded()
- [sasha] Let me work with the information I have. Let me analyze the commit based on the provided changes and compare it to similar commits: ## Analysis **CVE Status: YES** **Explanation:** This commit addresses multiple NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities in the `sma1307_setting_loaded()` function, which has clear security implications: 1. **Memory Allocation Failures**: The function performs multiple `kzalloc()` and `devm_kzalloc()` calls without checking for NULL returns, which could lead to NULL pointer dereferences when the system is under memory pressure. 2. **Security Impact**: The key security concerns are: - **NULL pointer dereference**: Lines like `memcpy(sma1307->set.header, data, sma1307->set.header_size linux sizeof(int))` would crash the kernel if `sma1307->set.header` is NULL - **Firmware parsing context**: This function processes firmware data loaded from files, making it a security-sensitive code path - **Audio driver context**: While audio drivers may seem less critical, kernel crashes can still be exploited for denial of service 3. **Pattern Matching with Historical CVEs**: This commit follows the exact same pattern as the provided similar commits that were assigned CVEs: - Similar Commit 1, 3: "ASoC: qcom: Fix NULL Dereference in asoc_qcom_lpass_cpu_platform_probe()" - CVE Status: YES - Similar Commit 4: "ALSA: core: Fix possible NULL dereference caused by kunit_kzalloc()" - CVE Status: YES - Similar Commit 5: "ASoC: fsl: fsl_qmc_audio: Check devm_kasprintf() returned value" - CVE Status: YES 4. **Code Changes Analysis**: The commit adds proper NULL checks after each memory allocation and implements appropriate cleanup on failure, preventing potential kernel crashes. This commit fixes a clear security vulnerability where NULL pointer dereferences could cause kernel crashes, making it eligible for CVE assignment consistent with similar historical commits in the audio subsystem.
149dfb31615e2 tcp: reorganize tcp_in_ack_event() and tcp_count_delivered()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit is a pure refactoring/reorganization change that does not fix any security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **No security issue being fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is reorganization to support "Accurate ECN's heuristics" - it's preparation work for a future feature, not fixing a bug or vulnerability. 2. **Code reorganization only**: The changes move existing functions around and split them: - `tcp_count_delivered_ce()` is extracted from `tcp_count_delivered()` - `tcp_in_ack_event()` is moved later in the processing flow - The `inline` keyword is removed from `tcp_in_ack_event()` 3. **No behavioral changes**: The code maintains identical functionality - it just reorganizes when certain functions are called to make information available for future ECN enhancements. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits, those marked "CVE Status: NO" are also refactoring changes that don't fix security issues, while the one marked "CVE Status: YES" actually fixed a concrete security vulnerability (accepting ACKs for bytes never sent). This commit is purely preparatory work for future functionality and doesn't address any security concerns, making it similar to the refactoring commits in the reference examples that were marked as not requiring CVEs.
0116a7d84b325 ASoC: mediatek: mt6359: Add stub for mt6359_accdet_enable_jack_detect
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the full context. The dependency line `depends on SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET || !SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET` means the machine driver can be built whether or not the ACCDET driver is enabled. However, the machine driver unconditionally calls `mt6359_accdet_enable_jack_detect()` which will cause a linker error if MT6359_ACCDET is not compiled in. **Analysis:** **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit addresses a build system/linker issue, not a security vulnerability. The code changes show: 1. **Nature of the fix**: Adding a stub function with `#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET)` to prevent linker failures when `CONFIG_SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET` is disabled. 2. **Root cause**: The MT8188-MT6359 machine driver (mt8188-mt6359.c:541) unconditionally calls `mt6359_accdet_enable_jack_detect()`, but this function is only available when `CONFIG_SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET=y`. The Kconfig shows the machine driver can be built with or without ACCDET support (`depends on SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET || !SND_SOC_MT6359_ACCDET`). 3. **Security impact**: None. This is purely a build configuration issue. The stub function simply returns `-EOPNOTSUPP` (operation not supported), which is appropriate error handling when the feature is disabled. 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: Like the other "NO" CVE status commits in the examples, this is a build/compatibility fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. It's similar to commit #2 and #3 which dealt with NULL pointer prevention during configuration, but this specifically addresses linker failures. The fix prevents build failures when certain Kconfig combinations are used, making the driver more robust in different build configurations, but introduces no security implications.
fe1e57d44d7f1 erofs: initialize decompression early
- [sasha] Now let me examine the commit more carefully in the context of the similar commits provided. **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a pure code reorganization/refactoring that moves initialization code to occur earlier in the filesystem mount process. The commit: - Renames `erofs_init_managed_cache()` to `z_erofs_init_super()` - Moves initialization of `managed_pslots` into the same function - Moves this initialization before root inode setup 2. **No security vulnerability**: The changes are structural improvements that: - Don't fix any security bugs - Don't address buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - Don't involve input validation improvements or race condition fixes - Don't change any security-sensitive logic 3. **Consistent with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (commits 1-5) with "CVE Status: NO" are also filesystem improvements, refactoring, or feature additions that don't address security vulnerabilities. This commit follows the same pattern. 4. **Purpose is feature enhancement**: The commit message states "Therefore, the root directory can also be compressible" - this is enabling a new feature (compressed root directories) by ensuring decompression infrastructure is ready before the root inode is processed. 5. **No error handling changes**: The commit doesn't fix error conditions that could lead to security issues; it simply reorders when certain initializations occur. This is a straightforward code improvement to enable compressed root directories in EROFS, with no security implications.
b0f9cb4a0706b rtc: rv3032: fix EERD location
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Bug:** The commit fixes a simple register bit definition error where `RV3032_CTRL1_EERD` was incorrectly defined as `BIT(3)` instead of `BIT(2)`. This is correcting the location of the EEPROM Read/Write Enable (EERD) bit in the CTRL1 register of the RV3032 RTC chip. **Security Impact Analysis:** 1. **Hardware Register Mapping Issue**: This is a hardware register bit mapping error, not a software logic vulnerability 2. **EEPROM Access Control**: EERD controls access to EEPROM functionality, but the bug would affect hardware communication rather than create exploitable software vulnerabilities 3. **Functional vs Security Impact**: The incorrect bit position would likely cause EEPROM operations to fail or behave incorrectly, but wouldn't create security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or memory corruption 4. **Driver Scope**: This affects only the RV3032 RTC driver's communication with a specific hardware chip **Comparison with Similar Commits:** Looking at the provided examples, all similar commits that received "CVE Status: NO" were also simple bit/register definition corrections: - rtc-abx80x.c: WDT bit position fix (BIT(6) → BIT(5)) - rtc-rv3032.c: EERD bit position fix (BIT(3) → BIT(2)) - riscv insn.h: Width mask correction - rtw89 fw.c: Debug format string fix **Missing Security Elements:** The code changes and commit message show no evidence of: - Buffer overflow fixes - Memory safety issues - Access control vulnerabilities - Input validation problems - Privilege escalation risks - Race conditions This is a straightforward hardware register bit definition correction that ensures proper communication with the RV3032 RTC chip, similar to the other "NO" CVE status commits in the examples provided.
b745962cb9756 objtool: Fix error handling inconsistencies in check()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, I can now make a determination: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes error handling consistency in the `check()` function of objtool, which is a build-time static analysis tool, not runtime kernel code. The changes ensure that when errors occur, they properly flow through the 'out' label instead of returning directly. 2. **No security vulnerability**: The specific changes are: - Adding proper error handling for `cfi_hash_alloc()` failure - Changing `return ret` to `goto out` for three validation functions (`validate_retpoline`, `validate_unrets`, `add_prefix_symbols`) 3. **Build-time tool only**: Objtool is a static analysis tool that runs during kernel compilation to validate stack unwinding information, retpoline usage, and other code patterns. It doesn't affect runtime security - it only affects the build process. 4. **Error handling consistency, not security**: The commit ensures that error paths are handled consistently (all going through the `out` label), but this doesn't fix any exploitable vulnerability. It's purely about proper cleanup and consistent error reporting in a development tool. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked as CVE Status: NO), they also deal with objtool fixes that don't have security implications - segfault fixes in the tool itself, intra-function call support, etc. The commit improves code quality and consistency in a build tool but doesn't address any security vulnerability that could be exploited at runtime.
a662f3c03b754 jbd2: do not try to recover wiped journal
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a correctness issue in journal recovery logic, not a security vulnerability. The problem is that when a journal is wiped but the filesystem is read-only (or in ocfs2), the on-disk superblock isn't updated, causing potential recovery attempts on already-wiped journals. 2. **Data Integrity, Not Security**: The issue affects data consistency and journal recovery behavior, but does not expose any security-sensitive attack vectors like: - No buffer overflows or memory corruption - No privilege escalation opportunities - No access control bypasses - No information disclosure 3. **Limited Impact Scope**: The fix only affects the recovery decision logic - changing from checking `sb->s_start` (on-disk superblock) to `journal->j_tail` (in-memory value that gets set to 0 by `jbd2_journal_skip_recovery()` at line 386). 4. **Operational vs. Security Issue**: This is an operational correctness issue that could cause unnecessary recovery operations, but doesn't create exploitable security conditions. The worst case is redundant journal processing, not security compromise. 5. **Pattern Match with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits provided, this aligns with commits marked "CVE Status: NO" which deal with journal/filesystem consistency issues (like Similar Commits 1, 3, 4, and 5) rather than security vulnerabilities. The commit ensures proper journal state management but doesn't fix any security-exploitable condition that would warrant CVE assignment.
5a5fc308418ac spi: spi-mux: Fix coverity issue, unchecked return value
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a bug where `spi_setup()` return values were ignored in the `spi_mux_select()` function, it does not address an exploitable security vulnerability. The specific code change (`return spi_setup(priv->spi);` instead of ignoring the return value) is a robustness improvement that: 1. **Prevents silent failures** - The system will now properly propagate errors instead of assuming success 2. **Improves error handling** - Callers can now detect and respond to setup failures appropriately 3. **Follows similar patterns** - This matches Similar Commit 1 (also NO CVE) which added the same type of return value checking for completeness However, unlike Similar Commit 4 (YES CVE), this fix does not prevent an immediate exploitable condition like NULL pointer dereference. The ignored return value led to potential system inconsistency and robustness issues, but not a directly exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment. The commit message also indicates this was identified by a static analysis tool (Coverity) as a code quality issue rather than a security-critical bug, which aligns with treating it as a robustness improvement rather than a security fix.
8f4a489b370e6 PCI: dwc: Use resource start as ioremap() input in dw_pcie_pme_turn_off()
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue completely. Based on my analysis of the commit: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit is a code cleanup/correctness fix that addresses a misnomer in variable naming and ensures proper address mapping, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit changes `ioremap(atu.cpu_addr, pci->region_align)` to `ioremap(pci->pp.msg_res->start, pci->region_align)` to use the correct CPU physical address for mapping. 2. **No security impact**: The issue being fixed is related to address translation correctness in PCIe power management, not a security flaw. The commit message explicitly states this is about fixing a "misnomer" where `cpu_addr` was incorrectly named and will be corrected in future patches. 3. **Functional correctness only**: This is purely a correctness issue where the wrong address variable was being used for `ioremap()`, but both addresses should map to the same physical memory region in properly functioning systems. 4. **Similar patterns**: All the provided reference commits (Similar Commits 1-5) with "CVE Status: NO" are also about PCIe driver correctness fixes, not security vulnerabilities. 5. **No memory safety issues**: The change doesn't address buffer overflows, privilege escalation, access control bypasses, or other security-relevant patterns. This is a driver correctness fix to ensure proper PCIe power management functionality, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
ad79c278e478c thunderbolt: Do not add non-active NVM if NVM upgrade is disabled for retimer
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and its security implications, here is my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** ## Analysis Summary This commit is **not a security vulnerability fix** that warrants a CVE. Instead, it's a **defensive security improvement** that implements better access controls. Here's why: ### 1. **Nature of the Change** The commit adds a conditional check `if (!rt->no_nvm_upgrade)` around `tb_nvm_add_non_active()` to prevent creation of writable NVM (firmware) interfaces when upgrades are disabled. This is a **proactive security hardening** measure, not a fix for an existing vulnerability. ### 2. **Security Impact Assessment** - **Reduces attack surface**: Prevents unnecessary exposure of firmware writing interfaces - **Implements defense in depth**: Adds an additional layer of protection - **No vulnerability being patched**: The code was not previously exploitable; this change makes it more secure - **Follows principle of least privilege**: Only exposes dangerous capabilities when needed ### 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits** Looking at the historical examples provided: - **Similar Commits 1, 2, 5**: These were simple functional improvements with no security implications - marked as NO CVE - **Similar Commits 3, 4**: These fixed actual race conditions and deadlock issues that could cause system hangs - marked as YES CVE This commit aligns with the "NO CVE" category as it's a functional improvement rather than a vulnerability fix. ### 4. **Technical Context** - The `tb_nvm_add_non_active()` function already has `root_only = true` access control - The `no_nvm_upgrade` flag is properly set for untrusted devices (cable retimers) - The change makes the interface creation consistent with the router NVM upgrade behavior - No indication of previous exploitable conditions or security bypasses ### 5. **Commit Message Analysis** The commit message states: "This is only used to write a new NVM in order to upgrade the retimer firmware. It does not make sense to expose it if upgrade is disabled. This also makes it consistent with the router NVM upgrade." This clearly indicates a **consistency and logic improvement**, not a security fix. **Conclusion: NO CVE required** - This is a security enhancement/hardening measure rather than a vulnerability fix.
860be250fc32d vfio/pci: Handle INTx IRQ_NOTCONNECTED
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the security context from the similar CVE-assigned commits, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No vulnerability fix**: This commit is not fixing a security vulnerability. Instead, it's adding proper handling for a specific hardware configuration where `pdev->irq` is set to `IRQ_NOTCONNECTED`, indicating the INTx interrupt is not routed. 2. **Defensive programming**: The changes are defensive programming to handle a legitimate hardware state: - Adding `pdev->irq == IRQ_NOTCONNECTED` check in `vfio_intx_enable()` to return `-ENODEV` instead of potentially trying to use an invalid IRQ - Virtualizing the PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN to 0 in config space when IRQ is not connected - Consolidating IRQ count reporting to use the virtualized value 3. **No security implications**: Unlike the similar commits that were marked CVE Status: YES (which fixed race conditions, null pointer dereferences, and use-after-free issues), this commit: - Doesn't fix memory safety issues - Doesn't fix race conditions - Doesn't address privilege escalation - Doesn't fix access control bypasses 4. **Consistency improvement**: The commit primarily improves consistency between the device's config space representation and ioctl interface when INTx is not available, making both behave as if the device doesn't support INTx. 5. **Error path improvement**: The change converts a potential `-ENOTCONN` error from `request_irq()` into a cleaner `-ENODEV` return, which is better error handling but not a security fix. This is a robustness improvement and proper hardware state handling, not a security vulnerability fix.
ad77cebf97bd4 scsi: st: ERASE does not change tape location
- [sasha] Now I can see that only MTREW (rewind) and MTRETEN (retension) reset the position variables to 0, which makes sense because these operations move the tape to the beginning. Based on my analysis, here's what this commit addresses: **CVE Assessment: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a logical bug in the SCSI tape driver but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit removes the line `fileno = blkno = at_sm = 0;` from the MTERASE case. Previously, the ERASE command incorrectly reset the tape position variables to indicate the tape was at the beginning (file 0, block 0), when in fact the SCSI ERASE command erases from the current position onwards and does not change the tape position. 2. **Impact Analysis**: This was a functional correctness bug, not a security issue. The incorrect position tracking could lead to: - Incorrect tape positioning information reported to applications - Potential data integrity issues if applications relied on incorrect position data for subsequent operations - However, these are operational/data integrity issues, not security vulnerabilities 3. **No Security Implications**: - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control bypasses - No privilege escalation opportunities - No exposure of sensitive information - No race conditions or use-after-free scenarios - The bug affects tape positioning logic only, not security-critical paths 4. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commits**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which involved race conditions causing NULL pointer dereferences and kernel crashes), this commit only fixes incorrect state tracking without any crash potential or security impact. 5. **Driver Context**: This is part of the SCSI tape (st) driver's ioctl handling, specifically fixing the position tracking logic for the ERASE operation to match SCSI specification behavior. The commit improves correctness and prevents potential data management issues but does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
00cdfdcfa0806 hypfs_create_cpu_files(): add missing check for hypfs_mkdir() failure
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit adds a missing error check for `hypfs_mkdir()` failure, but it does **not** warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The hypfs filesystem is specific to s390 architecture and is used for hypervisor information display. This significantly limits the potential attack surface compared to general filesystem vulnerabilities. 2. **Missing Error Handling vs. Security Vulnerability**: While the missing error check could lead to kernel crashes if `hypfs_mkdir()` fails (due to using an ERR_PTR value as a valid dentry pointer), this represents a **robustness issue** rather than a direct security vulnerability. 3. **No Evidence of Exploitation Potential**: The code changes show a straightforward error handling fix. Without the check, memory allocation failures would cause `IS_ERR(cpu_dir)` to be true, and subsequent calls would receive an invalid pointer, likely causing a kernel oops. However, this appears to be a denial-of-service scenario rather than memory corruption that could lead to privilege escalation. 4. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO", most are defensive programming fixes, code refactoring, or error handling improvements that don't represent exploitable security vulnerabilities. 5. **Architectural Specificity**: The s390 hypfs is a specialized component with limited exposure compared to core kernel subsystems. The fix prevents potential kernel crashes from unhandled `hypfs_mkdir()` failures, but this appears to be a reliability improvement rather than a security vulnerability that would merit CVE assignment.
3775be3417cc3 bpftool: Using the right format specifiers
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Changes:** The commit fixes format specifier warnings by correcting data type mismatches in printf-style functions. Examples include: - Using `%u` instead of `%d` for unsigned integers (`(u32)insn->imm` in disasm.c) - Adding proper type casts to match format specifiers (`(__u32)v->val` in btf.c) - Using appropriate format specifiers for different data types **Security Assessment:** 1. **No Format String Vulnerabilities**: These are not format string security issues where user-controlled strings are passed as format strings. Instead, they are type mismatches between format specifiers and arguments. 2. **Compiler Warnings Only**: The changes fix compiler warnings about format specifier mismatches, not actual security vulnerabilities. The kernel context from $CVEKERNELTREE shows that true format string security fixes involve adding `"%s"` specifiers when variable strings are passed as format strings - which is not the case here. 3. **No Exploitable Conditions**: Type mismatches in format specifiers typically cause incorrect output or undefined behavior but don't create exploitable security vulnerabilities in these contexts. 4. **Similar Historical Commits**: The reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar format specifier fixes that were correctly assessed as not requiring CVEs. **Conclusion:** This is a code quality and correctness improvement that eliminates compiler warnings, not a security fix. The changes ensure proper type matching between format specifiers and their arguments but don't address any exploitable security vulnerabilities.
affead2d904e8 ixgbe: add support for thermal sensor event reception
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes I can see. Based on the commit description and code changes provided: **Analysis:** **NO** This commit adds new functionality rather than fixing a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the commit**: This is a feature addition, not a security fix. The commit message clearly states it's adding "support for thermal sensor event reception" for E610 NICs. 2. **What the code does**: - Adds a new case `ixgbe_aci_opc_temp_tca_event` in the firmware event handler - When thermal threshold is exceeded, it logs a critical message and calls `ixgbe_down(adapter)` to disable the adapter - This is a protective mechanism to prevent hardware damage from overheating 3. **Security implications**: While thermal protection is important for hardware safety, this is not fixing a vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The thermal event handling is: - Triggered by firmware when hardware reaches dangerous temperatures - Results in the adapter being safely shut down - Requires physical hardware overheating to trigger 4. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this is similar to thermal management commits that add new functionality or improve hardware protection but don't fix exploitable vulnerabilities. 5. **No previous vulnerable state**: The commit doesn't indicate there was a previous insecure implementation - it's adding new functionality for a new hardware model (E610) that didn't have this capability before. This is a hardware protection feature addition, not a security vulnerability fix, so it does not warrant a CVE assignment.
4fcfcbe457349 wifi: mwifiex: Fix HT40 bandwidth issue.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can make the security assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is a "HT40 bandwidth issue" where connections were limited to 20MHz instead of 40MHz despite AP support. This is a performance/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Code Analysis**: The change adds a single line `chan_list->chan_scan_param[0].radio_type |= CHAN_BW_40MHZ << 2;` that sets the bandwidth flag correctly in the radio_type field. This is simply correcting a missing configuration step. 3. **No Security Implications**: - The change doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - It doesn't address input validation problems or race conditions - It doesn't involve privilege escalation or authentication bypasses - The missing bandwidth configuration does not create any security vulnerability 4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is very similar to "Similar Commit 1", "Similar Commit 3", "Similar Commit 4", and "Similar Commit 5" which are all marked as CVE Status: NO. These are all functional/configuration fixes in the mwifiex driver without security implications. 5. **Technical Context**: The code is in `mwifiex_cmd_append_11n_tlv()` which builds configuration data for 802.11n connections. The missing line simply failed to set the 40MHz bandwidth flag when both the local device and AP supported it, resulting in sub-optimal performance but no security risk. This is a straightforward performance optimization that enables proper 40MHz operation when supported, not a security vulnerability.
a6c81e32aeacb bnxt_en: Query FW parameters when the CAPS_CHANGE bit is set
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my security assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary This commit adds support for handling a new firmware flag (`CAPS_CHANGE`) that indicates when firmware capabilities or configurations have changed. The code changes are: 1. **New flag detection**: Added handling for `FUNC_DRV_IF_CHANGE_RESP_FLAGS_CAPS_CHANGE` flag 2. **Extended condition**: Changed `if (resc_reinit || fw_reset)` to `if (resc_reinit || fw_reset || caps_change)` 3. **Reset handling**: When `caps_change` is true, the driver now treats it similar to a firmware reset ## Why This Is Not a Security Vulnerability 1. **Feature Addition, Not Bug Fix**: This is adding support for a new firmware feature, not fixing an existing security issue. The commit message describes it as supporting "newer FW" functionality. 2. **Controlled Reset Process**: The code follows the same well-established reset and reinitialization path that is already used for firmware resets. This includes: - `bnxt_fw_init_one(bp)` - Proper firmware reinitialization - `bnxt_cancel_reservations()` - Resource cleanup - Proper error handling with state management 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The change doesn't introduce new attack vectors, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation opportunities. 4. **Firmware-Initiated**: The `CAPS_CHANGE` flag is set by firmware, not user input, making it a trusted source triggering the reset. 5. **Similar to Existing Code Paths**: The new `caps_change` condition follows the exact same code path as `fw_reset`, which has been in use and is considered safe. ## Comparison with Similar Commits All the provided similar commits (1-5) were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar driver improvements, feature additions, or non-security-related fixes. This commit follows the same pattern of being a feature enhancement rather than a security fix. The commit adds functionality to handle a new firmware capability flag in a controlled manner using existing, tested code paths for device reinitialization.
f88c349c75e37 net/mlx5: Preserve rate settings when creating a rate node
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit in more detail by examining what the function modification does: Based on my analysis of the commit and the historical examples provided: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: This is a function signature modification that adds parameters (`max_rate` and `bw_share`) to `esw_qos_create_node_sched_elem()` and updates the function to use these values when creating scheduling elements. 2. **No Security Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is a preparatory change for future functionality: "This change is essential for the upcoming patch that will modify rate nodes and requires the existing settings to be preserved unless explicitly changed." This is clearly a feature enhancement, not a security fix. 3. **Code Analysis**: The changes show: - Adding two new parameters to the function signature - Setting `MLX5_SET(scheduling_context, tsar_ctx, max_average_bw, max_rate)` and `MLX5_SET(scheduling_context, tsar_ctx, bw_share, bw_share)` - All call sites are updated to pass appropriate values (mostly 0 for new functionality, or preserving existing node values) 4. **Comparison with Historical Examples**: - Similar commits 1, 2, and 5 (CVE Status: NO) were also code improvements/refactoring without security implications - Similar commits 3 and 4 (CVE Status: YES) fixed actual resource leaks - memory management bugs with security implications - This commit has no memory management issues, access control problems, or vulnerability fixes 5. **No Security Keywords**: The commit message contains no security-related terms like "fix", "vulnerability", "leak", "overflow", etc. It uses terms like "preserve", "modify", and "upcoming patch" indicating planned feature work. This is a straightforward code refactoring to support future functionality, not a security fix.
8db816c6f1763 scsi: st: Tighten the page format heuristics with MODE SELECT
- [sasha] Now I have all the context I need to make an informed assessment. Let me analyze this commit: ## Analysis **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ### Code Change Analysis The commit adds two additional checks to the existing error handling logic: 1. **Added ASC check**: `cmdstatp->sense_hdr.asc == 0x24` - Only trigger fallback for "Invalid field in CDB" errors specifically 2. **Added SCSI level check**: `(STp->device)->scsi_level <= SCSI_2` - Only apply this heuristic to SCSI-2 and older devices ### Previous vs. Current Behavior **Before the fix:** ```c if (cmdstatp->sense_hdr.sense_key == ILLEGAL_REQUEST && !(STp->use_pf & PF_TESTED)) { ``` **After the fix:** ```c if (cmdstatp->sense_hdr.sense_key == ILLEGAL_REQUEST && cmdstatp->sense_hdr.asc == 0x24 && (STp->device)->scsi_level <= SCSI_2 && !(STp->use_pf & PF_TESTED)) { ``` ### Security Assessment **This is NOT a security vulnerability because:** 1. **Logic Tightening, Not Fixing**: The change makes the heuristic more restrictive, not less. It reduces false positives rather than fixing a security hole. 2. **No Security Impact**: The previous behavior caused "false alarms" (as stated in commit message) where the driver would unnecessarily retry with different page format settings on unrelated ILLEGAL_REQUEST errors. This was inefficient but not dangerous. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: This code path only affects control flow for error recovery. It doesn't involve buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption issues. 4. **No Privilege Escalation**: The change only affects when the driver retries MODE SELECT commands with different parameters. There's no impact on access controls or permissions. 5. **No Information Disclosure**: The fix doesn't address any information leakage concerns. ### Comparison to CVE-Assigned Examples Unlike the CVE-assigned examples in the reference commits which involved: - Buffer length validation failures (Similar Commits 3, 4, 5) - Use-after-free vulnerabilities (Similar Commit 4) - Off-by-one errors causing out-of-bounds access (Similar Commit 5) This commit only improves the precision of error handling logic without addressing any memory safety or security concerns. **Conclusion**: This is a code quality improvement that reduces unnecessary operations, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
e82cf3051e619 um: Update min_low_pfn to match changes in uml_reserved
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the kernel codebase context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a correctness fix for maintaining internal data structure consistency, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit ensures that `min_low_pfn` accurately reflects the lowest available page frame number after `uml_reserved` is updated. 2. **Code analysis**: The change adds a single line `min_low_pfn = PFN_UP(__pa(uml_reserved));` after `uml_reserved = brk_end;` to keep these variables synchronized. This is a bookkeeping update to maintain consistency between related memory management variables. 3. **Impact assessment**: - `min_low_pfn` is primarily used for bounds checking in memory leak detection (`mm/kmemleak.c`) and debugging features (`mm/page_owner.c`) - An incorrect `min_low_pfn` value could cause false positives/negatives in debugging tools but doesn't create exploitable security vulnerabilities - This affects User Mode Linux (UML) only, which is a virtualization technology, not core kernel functionality 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" involve similar memory management bookkeeping fixes, corrections to min/max_pfn values, and architecture-specific memory initialization improvements - none of which were deemed security vulnerabilities. 5. **No security implications**: The commit message and code changes show no indication of fixing buffer overflows, access control bypasses, privilege escalation, or other security-sensitive issues. It's purely a consistency fix. This is a routine maintenance fix to ensure proper synchronization of memory management variables in UML, similar to the other non-CVE commits provided as examples.
86947bdc28894 loop: move vfs_fsync() out of loop_update_dio()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** This is a lockdep warning fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit moves `vfs_fsync()` calls out of `loop_update_dio()` to prevent lockdep warnings that occur when the queue freeze lock is connected with too many subsystem locks. **Code Changes Analysis:** 1. **Removes problematic call site**: The `vfs_fsync()` call is removed from inside `loop_update_dio()` where it was being called while holding queue freeze locks 2. **Relocates to safe locations**: The `vfs_fsync()` calls are moved to `loop_change_fd()` and `loop_configure()` where they can be called safely before queue operations 3. **No functional change**: The sync behavior is preserved - dirty pages are still flushed before switching to direct I/O, just at different (safer) points in the code **Security Assessment:** - **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or similar issues - **No privilege escalation**: No changes to access controls or permissions - **No race conditions**: Actually improves locking correctness by avoiding lockdep warnings - **No input validation issues**: No changes to how user input is handled - **No denial of service**: Fixes a locking issue that could potentially cause lockdep warnings but doesn't create new attack vectors **Comparison to CVE Examples:** Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed actual deadlock potential), this commit only addresses lockdep warnings - a debugging/diagnostic issue rather than a functional deadlock that could be exploited. This is a code quality improvement that fixes a locking correctness warning without changing the fundamental security properties or creating new attack surfaces.
1b419c889c076 ext4: reorder capability check last
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit in detail. Based on my examination of the code and similar commits, I can provide my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** ## Analysis This commit addresses an **audit noise and policy configuration issue** with SELinux, not a security vulnerability. Here's my detailed analysis: ### The Change The commit reorders the capability check (`capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE)`) to be evaluated **last** in the logical OR condition within `ext4_has_free_clusters()`: **Before:** ```c if (uid_eq(sbi->s_resuid, current_fsuid()) || (!gid_eq(sbi->s_resgid, GLOBAL_ROOT_GID) && in_group_p(sbi->s_resgid)) || capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) || (flags & EXT4_MB_USE_ROOT_BLOCKS)) { ``` **After:** ```c if (uid_eq(sbi->s_resuid, current_fsuid()) || (!gid_eq(sbi->s_resgid, GLOBAL_ROOT_GID) && in_group_p(sbi->s_resgid)) || (flags & EXT4_MB_USE_ROOT_BLOCKS) || capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE)) { ``` ### Why This Is NOT a Security Vulnerability 1. **No Change in Access Control Logic**: The logical conditions remain identical. The same processes that could access reserved blocks before can still access them after. 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The commit does not grant new privileges or remove existing security checks. 3. **Audit Noise Issue Only**: The problem being solved is that `capable()` calls generate SELinux audit messages even when the operation succeeds through other means (UID/GID match or flags), creating unnecessary audit noise. 4. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Examples**: This is identical to the RDMA/mlx5 commit (3745242ad1e1) which addresses the same SELinux audit noise issue and was not assigned a CVE. ### Security Context Unchanged The ext4 reserved blocks mechanism continues to work exactly the same way: - Regular users still cannot access reserved space without proper credentials - Root and configured reserved UID/GID still have access - Processes with `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` still have access - The security boundary between regular and reserved space is unchanged ### Conclusion This is a **code quality and audit hygiene improvement**, not a security fix. It reduces unnecessary SELinux audit messages without changing any security boundaries or access control decisions. Based on the similar commits in the kernel tree and the nature of the change, this should **NOT** receive a CVE. **Answer: NO**
03d2b62208a33 dlm: make tcp still work in multi-link env
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the commit. Let me analyze this for security implications: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ### What the commit does: 1. **Before**: DLM TCP mode would return `-EINVAL` error when multiple IP addresses were detected on a host (multi-homed) 2. **After**: DLM TCP mode logs a warning but continues operation using only the first IP address ### Key Security Analysis: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is not fixing a security vulnerability but rather changing a functional limitation. The original code was intentionally restrictive to prevent potential issues with multi-homed hosts in TCP mode. 2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The changes are purely in error handling logic - changing from `return -EINVAL` to `return 0` with warning messages. No buffer overflows, memory corruption, or similar issues are involved. 3. **No Access Control Changes**: This doesn't modify authentication, authorization, or privilege escalation mechanisms. 4. **No Data Exposure**: The change doesn't expose sensitive data or create information leaks. 5. **Defensive to Permissive Change**: The commit actually makes the code more permissive (allowing previously rejected configurations) rather than fixing a flaw that could be exploited. ### Context of DLM (Distributed Lock Manager): - DLM is a cluster coordination service used for distributed locking - The multi-homed restriction was a safety measure, not a security boundary - SCTP is recommended for multi-link scenarios, TCP was limited to single-link ### Comparison with Similar Commits: - Similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 4" which are functional improvements/changes rather than security fixes - Unlike "Similar Commits 2 & 5" which fix actual race conditions and data races (security-relevant) ### Conclusion: This is a functional enhancement that relaxes a previous restriction rather than fixing a security vulnerability. No CVE is warranted.
d9be2b9b60497 riscv: Call secondary mmu notifier when flushing the tlb
- [sasha] **NO** Based on my analysis, this commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. While the commit does fix a security-relevant issue (missing secondary MMU notifications that could lead to stale IOMMU TLB entries), this appears to be implementing missing functionality rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. **Key reasons against CVE assignment:** 1. **Feature Implementation vs. Bug Fix**: This adds missing MMU notifier calls to bring RISC-V in line with x86 and ARM64 architectures. The code changes show a systematic addition of `mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs()` calls following established patterns from other architectures. 2. **Limited Real-World Impact**: The security implications (stale IOMMU TLB entries potentially allowing unauthorized device memory access) would only affect systems with: - RISC-V processors - Active IOMMU usage - Devices that rely on secondary MMU notifications This combination was likely rare when this issue existed. 3. **Pattern from Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits, Similar Commit 2 involved MMU notifier fixes for ARM64 but was marked "CVE Status: NO". The ARM64 fix addressed a similar issue with secondary MMU invalidation but was not deemed CVE-worthy. 4. **No Evidence of Exploitation**: The commit message simply states this is "required to allow the IOMMU driver to correctly flush its own TLB" - indicating missing functionality rather than fixing a known vulnerability. The commit represents important hardening work to ensure proper IOMMU behavior, but falls into the category of architectural completeness rather than fixing an actively exploitable security flaw.
e00e5c223878a drm/amdgpu: adjust drm_firmware_drivers_only() handling
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the security implications of this change: ## Analysis: **CVE Status: NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fix**: The commit is adjusting driver loading behavior related to the `nomodeset` kernel parameter, not fixing any security vulnerability. It's a functionality enhancement, not a security fix. 2. **Access Control Enhancement, Not Bypass**: The changes actually **improve** the logic by: - Moving the `drm_firmware_drivers_only()` check to the probe function - Adding PCI device class checks to only apply the restriction to display devices (`PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA` and `PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_OTHER`) - Adding a module parameter override mechanism (`amdgpu_modeset`) 3. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Commits**: This commit follows the same pattern as the provided similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO": - Driver configuration/parameter adjustments - Logic refinements for existing functionality - No memory safety issues, privilege escalation, or access control bypasses 4. **Code Analysis**: The changes show: - Lines 2274-2278: Add PCI class check and `drm_firmware_drivers_only()` logic that **prevents** driver loading when firmware-only mode is enabled (unless overridden) - Line 180: Add new module parameter `amdgpu_modeset = -1` - Module parameter documentation indicates this is for overriding `nomodeset`, which is a legitimate administrative control 5. **No Security-Sensitive Components Affected**: This doesn't involve: - Memory management vulnerabilities - Buffer overflows - Race conditions - Privilege escalation - Input validation issues The commit actually **strengthens** access control by making the firmware-only driver check more precise (only for display devices) while providing an administrative override mechanism. This is a normal driver enhancement, not a security fix.
9deacd6c55f1b drm/amdgpu: don't free conflicting apertures for non-display devices
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit for security implications. Let me analyze the key points: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit is a **defensive fix** that **prevents** a potential security issue rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. Here's why it doesn't warrant a CVE: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds a PCI class check to conditionally call `aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()` only for display devices (`PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA` or `PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_OTHER`), skipping it for `PCI_CLASS_ACCELERATOR_PROCESSING` devices. 2. **Prevention, Not Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this "prevents the sysfb from being freed accidentally" - this is preventive hardening, not fixing an active vulnerability. 3. **Context from Similar Commit 5**: Similar Commit 5 (which was marked CVE:YES) shows that improper handling of `sysfb_disable()` can lead to NULL pointer dereferences when resources are freed accidentally. This commit prevents exactly that scenario. 4. **No Active Exploitation**: The code change doesn't fix memory corruption, privilege escalation, or any actively exploitable condition. Instead, it prevents a class of devices (accelerators) from unnecessarily calling aperture cleanup functions. 5. **Scope Limited to Driver Logic**: This only affects AMD GPU driver initialization logic for determining when to remove conflicting framebuffers. Non-display devices (like compute accelerators) legitimately don't need this cleanup. 6. **Comparison to Reference Commits**: Unlike the similar commits that were marked NO (which were also defensive/correctness fixes), this doesn't address race conditions, memory leaks, or initialization ordering issues that could be exploited. The change improves robustness and prevents potential future issues, but doesn't fix an existing security vulnerability that could be exploited.
70c93b026ed07 clocksource/drivers/timer-riscv: Stop stimecmp when cpu hotplug
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** 1. **Operational Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit adds a timer stop operation during CPU hotplug to prevent timer interrupts from being pending during power-down. This is an operational correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. 2. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar commit #1 (timer interrupt clearing) was marked "CVE Status: NO" - Similar commit #3 (timer wakeup capability fix) was marked "CVE Status: NO" - Both deal with timer management issues similar to this commit 3. **No Direct Attack Vector**: The code change prevents timer interrupts from firing while a CPU is powering down. While this could theoretically prevent some race conditions or system instability, there's no indication this creates a direct security vulnerability that an attacker could exploit. 4. **Preventive Measure**: The commit message states it prevents timer interrupts from being "pending while performing power-down" - this is about ensuring clean CPU state transitions rather than fixing a security flaw. 5. **Standard CPU Hotplug Hygiene**: Analysis of the kernel tree shows this is part of standard CPU hotplug procedures across architectures - it's a necessary operational step rather than a security fix. The commit adds 6 lines of code that simply call `riscv_clock_event_stop()` before disabling the per-CPU IRQ during CPU offline. This is a system stability and correctness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
0430bf9bc1ac0 i3c: master: svc: Fix missing STOP for master request
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary **What the fix does**: The commit adds `svc_i3c_master_emit_stop(master);` to properly terminate I3C bus transactions when master requests are refused. Previously, the controller would NACK (refuse) master requests but fail to emit the required STOP signal to return the bus to IDLE state. **Technical context**: - I3C "master requests" are when devices on the bus request to become the bus controller - The `svc_i3c_master_emit_stop()` function writes a STOP condition to the bus control register - This ensures proper I3C protocol compliance by terminating transactions correctly **Security implications**: 1. **Protocol compliance issue**: This is primarily about adhering to I3C protocol specifications, not security boundaries 2. **Bus reliability**: While improper bus state could cause reliability issues, it doesn't create direct security vulnerabilities 3. **No access control impact**: The fix doesn't address privilege escalation, memory corruption, or bypass of security controls 4. **Consistent pattern**: All provided similar commits addressing I3C protocol correctness are marked "CVE Status: NO" **Code evidence**: Looking at lines 594-596 in `/drivers/i3c/master/svc-i3c-master.c`, the fix simply ensures that master requests follow the same pattern as other IBI types (IBI and HOT_JOIN) which already properly emit STOP signals after processing. This is a correctness and reliability fix to ensure proper I3C protocol compliance, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
e1a0202c6bfda blk-cgroup: improve policy registration error handling
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of what this commit changes. Let me analyze it: ## Analysis **NO** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ### Code Analysis The commit makes two primary changes to `blkcg_policy_register()`: 1. **Moves validation logic earlier**: The validation check for function pair correctness (`cpd/pd_alloc_fn` and `cpd/pd_free_fn` must be provided in pairs) is moved from after mutex acquisition to before mutex acquisition. 2. **Fixes error code**: When `cpd_alloc_fn()` fails, the function now explicitly returns `-ENOMEM` instead of using the previously set `ret = -ENOSPC`. ### Why this is NOT a security issue: 1. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The original code had incorrect error reporting, not a security flaw. Before the fix: - Invalid function pairs would return `-ENOSPC` instead of `-EINVAL` - Memory allocation failures would return `-ENOSPC` instead of `-ENOMEM` 2. **No functional behavior change**: The validation logic itself is unchanged - only the order of checks and error codes returned are different. 3. **No memory safety issues**: There are no buffer overflows, memory leaks, use-after-free, or other memory safety problems being fixed. 4. **No privilege escalation**: This doesn't affect access controls or permissions. 5. **Code quality improvement only**: This is purely a code quality and API consistency improvement to return more appropriate error codes to callers. ### Comparison with CVE examples: Looking at the similar commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" (commits 3, 4, and 5), they all fix actual resource leaks or validation issues that could cause system instability. This commit only improves error reporting without fixing any underlying functional problems. This is a routine code improvement for better error handling semantics, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
1283b8c125a83 btrfs: get zone unusable bytes while holding lock at btrfs_reclaim_bgs_work()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit carefully: **CVE Status: NO** This commit is a race condition fix for a data race detected by KCSAN, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** 1. Moves the read of `bg->zone_unusable` to occur while holding the block group's spinlock 2. Prevents a race condition where multiple threads could access `zone_unusable` concurrently **Why this is NOT a security issue:** 1. **Data Race vs Security Vulnerability**: This is a classic data race where one thread reads a value while another thread might be updating it. However, this race doesn't lead to: - Buffer overflows - Memory corruption - Privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Use-after-free conditions 2. **Impact Analysis**: The race condition affects: - Accuracy of logging information (the percentage calculation in the log message) - Potential inconsistency in zone unusable byte tracking - KCSAN warnings/reports 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The `zone_unusable` field is a simple u64 counter. Even if read during an update, this won't cause memory corruption or security issues - just potentially stale data. 4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the historical examples provided, commits that fix similar data races (like the first example "get used bytes while holding lock") were marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of race fix typically doesn't warrant a CVE. 5. **Commit Context**: The commit message explicitly mentions this is for "race reports from KCSAN" - it's a code quality/correctness fix, not a security fix. The fix ensures atomic access to prevent tool warnings and improve code correctness, but doesn't address any exploitable security vulnerability.
b5aaa82e2b12f drm/amdgpu: release xcp_mgr on exit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, I can now provide a comprehensive assessment: **NO** This commit fixes a memory leak issue but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds `kfree(adev->xcp_mgr)` and `adev->xcp_mgr = NULL` to the `amdgpu_device_fini_sw()` function. This is a straightforward memory leak fix where allocated memory wasn't being freed during driver cleanup. 2. **Memory allocation context**: From examining the source code, `xcp_mgr` is allocated in `amdgpu_xcp_mgr_init()` using `kzalloc()`, but there was no corresponding `kfree()` in the cleanup path. 3. **Impact assessment**: This is a kernel memory leak that occurs during driver cleanup/unload. While memory leaks can theoretically lead to resource exhaustion over time, this specific leak: - Only occurs during driver shutdown/cleanup - Is not in a code path that can be repeatedly triggered by unprivileged users - Does not involve sensitive memory content or access control mechanisms - Does not create exploitable conditions for privilege escalation or system compromise 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) was marked as a CVE because it fixed a "use-after-free" issue, which is a more serious security vulnerability - Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 (CVE Status: NO) were resource management and cleanup fixes similar to this one 5. **Security implications**: This is a standard resource cleanup issue without security implications. The memory leak doesn't expose sensitive information, doesn't allow unauthorized access, and doesn't create exploitable conditions. This commit represents good software engineering practice (preventing memory leaks) but does not fix a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
9c2f4ae64bb6f drm/amd/display: Guard against setting dispclk low for dcn31x
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and security implications, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Performance optimization, not security fix**: The commit message clearly describes this as an optimization that should only be applied when displays are disabled ("This is always an optimization for when all displays are disabled"). The changes defer dispclk optimization until `safe_to_lower = true` and `display_count reaches 0`. 2. **Preventive hardening, not vulnerability fix**: The code changes add guards (`new_clocks->dispclk_khz > 0 || (safe_to_lower && display_count == 0)`) to prevent inappropriate clock settings, but this appears to be preventive hardening rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability. 3. **Similar commit patterns show NO CVE**: All 5 similar commits provided as references (involving AMD display driver clock management) were marked with "CVE Status: NO", including commits that fix "stability issues" and add similar safety guards. 4. **No security vulnerability language**: The commit message uses terms like "optimization", "defer", and "safe_to_lower" rather than security-focused language like "fix", "vulnerability", or "exploit". 5. **Code change analysis**: The modifications primarily add conditional logic to ensure dispclk changes only occur when safe, preventing potential display underflow or hardware instability. While system stability is important, these appear to be robustness improvements rather than security vulnerability fixes. The commit improves system robustness and prevents potential hardware issues, but based on the established patterns in similar AMD display driver commits, this type of clock management improvement typically does not warrant CVE assignment.
07651ccda9ff1 bpf: Return prog btf_id without capable check
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Legitimate Feature Enhancement**: The commit enables a valid use case where freplace (function replacement) BPF programs running from user namespaces need to query target program's BTF information for type safety and verification purposes. This is a legitimate operational requirement, not a security bypass. 2. **Limited Information Disclosure**: The change only exposes the BTF object ID (`info.btf_id`), which is a simple integer identifier. This is significantly less sensitive than the actual BTF data, program bytecode, JIT code, or other detailed program information that remains protected by the `bpf_capable()` check. 3. **No Elevation of Privileges**: The BTF ID itself doesn't grant any additional capabilities or allow bypassing other security controls. It's merely an identifier that can be used for legitimate BTF lookups. 4. **Consistency with Security Model**: The commit maintains the existing security boundaries - all sensitive program data (JIT code, bytecode, debug info, etc.) still requires proper capabilities. Only the BTF identifier is made accessible. 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Unlike the CVE-marked commits in the examples (which fixed out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities), this commit intentionally relaxes a restriction to enable legitimate functionality rather than fixing a memory safety or access control vulnerability. The code change specifically moves `info.btf_id = btf_obj_id(prog->aux->btf);` from inside the `bpf_capable()` check to outside it, which is an intentional design decision to support cross-namespace freplace program operations, not a security oversight.
df94a342efb45 btrfs: run btrfs_error_commit_super() early
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Issue:** The commit fixes a race condition in btrfs filesystem cleanup code that leads to a kernel assertion failure (`ASSERT(list_empty(&fs_info->delayed_iputs))`). The race occurs between the main thread running `close_ctree()` and `endio_write_workers` adding delayed iputs after they've been processed. **Code Changes Analysis:** The fix involves: 1. Moving `btrfs_error_commit_super()` earlier in `close_ctree()` (fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:4329) 2. Removing `btrfs_run_delayed_iputs()` from within `btrfs_error_commit_super()` (fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:4554) This is purely a reordering/timing fix to ensure proper sequencing of operations. **Why Not a CVE:** 1. **Limited Impact**: While this causes a kernel crash (denial of service), it requires the filesystem to already be in an error state and involves cleanup code paths 2. **No Security Implications**: No memory safety issues, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or access control bypasses 3. **Reliability Fix**: This is fundamentally a stability/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability 4. **Historical Precedent**: Similar commits like "fix non-empty delayed iputs list on unmount" and "run delayed iputs when flushing delalloc" were not assigned CVEs, indicating filesystem race conditions of this nature typically don't warrant CVE assignment The fix addresses filesystem robustness rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes.
be7113d2e2a6f i2c: pxa: fix call balance of i2c->clk handling routines
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code, I can see that this is a bug fix that addresses an improper resource cleanup issue. Let me compare this with the similar commits provided: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a resource cleanup bug in the i2c-pxa driver but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit fixes a call balance issue where `clk_prepare_enable(i2c->clk)` could fail, but the error path (`ereqirq`) would still call `clk_disable_unprepare(i2c->clk)` even though the clock was never successfully enabled. 2. **Code Changes**: The fix adds proper error checking for `clk_prepare_enable()` and returns early if it fails, preventing the unbalanced clock disable call in the error path. 3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: This follows the exact same pattern as the other "CVE Status: NO" commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (pxa168_eth): Clock balance fix - NO CVE - Similar Commit 2 (bcmsysport): Clock balance fix - NO CVE - Similar Commit 3 (xiic): Clock balance fix - NO CVE - Similar Commit 4 (dwmac-intel-plat): Clock balance fix - NO CVE 4. **Security Impact**: This is purely a resource management bug that could cause: - Kernel warning messages about unbalanced clock operations - Potential system instability in edge cases - But it does NOT create exploitable security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues 5. **Contrast with CVE-worthy commit**: The one "CVE Status: YES" example (Similar Commit 5) involved a deadlock scenario that could be triggered during normal operations, representing a denial-of-service vulnerability. This current commit doesn't have such implications. The fix ensures proper resource cleanup but doesn't address any security vulnerability that would allow attackers to compromise system security, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service attacks.
895c6721d310c btrfs: make btrfs_discard_workfn() block_group ref explicit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and comparison with the similar commits provided, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit is a code cleanup/refactoring that simplifies reference counting logic rather than fixing a security issue. The commit message explicitly states it's about making the code "needlessly complicated" simpler. 2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the similar commits that had CVE status YES, this commit doesn't fix: - Use-after-free vulnerabilities - Reference counting underflows/overflows that could lead to memory corruption - Race conditions that could cause crashes or undefined behavior 3. **Functional Equivalence**: The changes maintain the same functional behavior but with cleaner code structure: - The old code relied on complex locking and nullity checks of `discard_ctl->block_group` - The new code takes an explicit reference in `peek_discard_list()` (line 274: `btrfs_get_block_group(block_group)`) and unconditionally drops it in both remove and workfn paths (line 571: `btrfs_put_block_group(block_group)`) 4. **Contrast with CVE-worthy Similar Commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs all involved: - Actual race conditions causing refcount underflows - Missing spinlock protection leading to list corruption - Broken reference counting that could trigger kernel warnings and crashes 5. **Code Improvement Nature**: The commit message uses language typical of refactoring: "simplify this significantly", "needlessly complicated", which indicates improvement rather than security fix. The commit makes the reference counting more explicit and easier to follow, but doesn't address any exploitable vulnerability or crash condition.
7ef3cbf17d273 btrfs: avoid linker error in btrfs_find_create_tree_block()
- [sasha] Now I have a complete picture of the commit. Let me analyze the code changes and their security implications: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the Change:** The commit adds a stub version of `alloc_test_extent_buffer()` function to avoid linker errors when `CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS` is not set and compiler optimizations are turned off (-O0). **Code Analysis:** 1. **Problem:** When `CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS` is not set, `btrfs_is_testing()` hardcoded returns 0, and the compiler normally optimizes out the call to `alloc_test_extent_buffer()` in `btrfs_find_create_tree_block()`. However, with -O0 optimization, this call isn't optimized out, causing linker errors since the function wasn't defined. 2. **Solution:** The fix moves `alloc_test_extent_buffer()` outside the `#ifdef CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS` block and adds a stub implementation that simply returns `NULL` when the config is not set. 3. **Security Assessment:** - **No functional change:** This is purely a build/compilation fix with no runtime behavior change - **No security vulnerability:** The code path is only used for testing infrastructure, not production functionality - **Safe stub:** The stub returns `NULL`, which would be handled appropriately by calling code - **No memory management issues:** No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control changes - **No attack vectors:** This doesn't introduce any new attack surfaces or fix existing vulnerabilities **Comparison with Similar Commits:** This commit is similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 4" which are both marked as CVE Status: NO - they are refactoring/cleanup commits that don't fix security vulnerabilities. Unlike "Similar Commits 2 and 3" which replaced `BUG_ON()` calls that could cause kernel panics with proper error handling (security improvements), this commit only addresses a compilation issue. **Conclusion:** This is a build system fix to prevent linker errors, not a security vulnerability fix. It does not address any exploitable conditions or improve security posture.
b719afaa1e5d8 i2c: amd-asf: Set cmd variable when encountering an error
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what this bug fix addresses: **Analysis:** Looking at the code change and the function flow: 1. **Original Issue**: When an ASF error occurs (line 69: `if (reg & ASF_ERROR_STATUS)`), the code was setting `cmd = 0` 2. **The Fix**: Changed `cmd = 0` to `cmd = 1` 3. **Critical Check**: Later at line 107, there's a check `if (cmd & BIT(0))` which causes an early return **The Problem**: - When `cmd = 0`, `cmd & BIT(0)` evaluates to `0 & 1 = 0` (false) - This means the function would **continue processing** even when there was an error - The function would proceed to call `i2c_slave_event()` functions with potentially uninitialized or invalid data **The Fix**: - When `cmd = 1`, `cmd & BIT(0)` evaluates to `1 & 1 = 1` (true) - This causes the function to **return early** and skip data processing when there's an error **Security Analysis**: This is **NOT** a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE because: 1. **No Memory Safety Issues**: This doesn't involve buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or memory corruption 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: This doesn't affect access controls or allow unauthorized operations 3. **No Information Disclosure**: This doesn't leak sensitive information 4. **Limited Scope**: This is a logic error in error handling within an I2C driver 5. **No Remote Attack Vector**: This affects local hardware communication only The commit fixes incorrect behavior where error conditions weren't properly handled, but it's a functional bug fix rather than a security fix. The impact is that I2C slave operations might continue with invalid data when they should abort, which could cause device malfunction but not security compromise. **NO** This commit fixes a logic error in error handling where the function continued processing invalid data instead of exiting early when ASF errors occurred. While this could cause device malfunction, it does not present a security vulnerability - there's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impact that would warrant CVE assignment.
d1770e909898c arm64/mm: Check pmd_table() in pmd_trans_huge()
- [sasha] This is a critical finding! The previous ARM64 implementation was using `PMD_TABLE_BIT` which doesn't exist on ARM64 - it only exists on 32-bit ARM. This means the old code was referencing an undefined constant, which would evaluate to 0. Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my determination: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary **The Actual Issue:** The previous `pmd_trans_huge()` implementation referenced `PMD_TABLE_BIT`, which **does not exist in ARM64 architecture** - it only exists in 32-bit ARM. This means the old code was essentially doing: ```c !(pmd_val(pmd) & 0) // PMD_TABLE_BIT is undefined = 0 ``` Which always evaluates to `true`, making the check ineffective. **What This Commit Fixes:** 1. **Corrects undefined symbol usage**: Replaces the non-existent `PMD_TABLE_BIT` with proper `pmd_table()` function 2. **Handles present-invalid entries properly**: The `| PTE_VALID` ensures present-invalid PMDs are classified correctly 3. **Improves code correctness**: Uses architecture-appropriate type checking **Why This Is NOT a Security Vulnerability:** 1. **No exploitation vector**: The bug made `pmd_trans_huge()` more permissive (always returning true for the table bit check), not more restrictive. This could cause performance issues but not security vulnerabilities. 2. **Compiler/linker would catch**: Any actual usage of undefined `PMD_TABLE_BIT` would likely be caught at compile time as an undefined symbol error. 3. **Defense-in-depth fix**: This appears to be part of a cleanup series improving code correctness rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability. 4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This matches the pattern of the similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - it's a correctness/robustness improvement rather than a security fix. The commit represents good defensive programming and architectural correctness, but does not fix an exploitable security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
d4f35233a6345 i2c: qup: Vote for interconnect bandwidth to DRAM
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is adding functionality for interconnect bandwidth voting to improve DMA performance, not fixing a security issue. The commit message clearly states it's about ensuring the I2C controller can "access the memory quickly enough" when using DMA. 2. **Infrastructure enhancement**: The changes add interconnect bandwidth management: - New `icc_path` field in the driver structure - `qup_i2c_vote_bw()` function to request bandwidth - Bandwidth voting before DMA operations - Bandwidth release during runtime suspend 3. **No vulnerability patterns**: The code changes show no signs of fixing: - Buffer overflows - Memory corruption - Access control bypasses - Input validation issues - Race conditions - Privilege escalation vulnerabilities 4. **Consistent with similar commits**: The provided examples show similar infrastructure and device tree commits that were correctly classified as "NO" for CVE assignment. This commit follows the same pattern of hardware support improvements rather than security fixes. 5. **Error handling is proper**: The bandwidth voting function includes proper error checking with `icc_set_bw()` return value validation and early return on failure. This is a performance enhancement commit that adds interconnect bandwidth management to prevent memory access timing issues, not a security vulnerability fix.
631ca8909fd5c x86/mm: Check return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()
- [sasha] The critical insight is clear now. Let me look for the specific vulnerable pattern by examining what happens when memblock_phys_alloc_range returns 0: Based on my analysis of the commit and the code, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: YES** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a critical memory safety vulnerability in x86 memory management initialization. The security issue occurs in the `memory_map_top_down()` function: **Vulnerability Analysis:** 1. **Unchecked Return Value**: The original code called `memblock_phys_alloc_range()` without checking if it returned 0 (indicating allocation failure) 2. **Memory Corruption**: When allocation fails and returns 0, the subsequent `memblock_phys_free(addr, PMD_SIZE)` call with `addr=0` would free the first 4 MiB of physical memory (addresses 0x0 to 0x400000) 3. **Critical Memory Region**: This affects the first 4 MiB of physical memory, which contains crucial system structures like the interrupt vector table, BIOS data area, and other critical low memory structures **Security Impact:** - **Memory corruption** of critical system memory regions - **System instability** and potential crashes ("crash and burn" as mentioned in commit message) - **Potential privilege escalation** if an attacker can trigger this condition and control the freed memory - **Denial of Service** through system crashes **Code Evidence:** The fix shows the vulnerable pattern: ```c // BEFORE (vulnerable): addr = memblock_phys_alloc_range(PMD_SIZE, PMD_SIZE, map_start, map_end); memblock_phys_free(addr, PMD_SIZE); // If addr=0, frees first 4MB! // AFTER (fixed): addr = memblock_phys_alloc_range(PMD_SIZE, PMD_SIZE, map_start, map_end); if (!addr) { pr_warn("Failed to release memory for alloc_low_pages()"); real_end = max(map_start, ALIGN_DOWN(map_end, PMD_SIZE)); } else { memblock_phys_free(addr, PMD_SIZE); real_end = addr + PMD_SIZE; } ``` **Similar to CVE-worthy commits:** This pattern matches Similar Commit 1 and 3 which were assigned CVEs for memory management issues involving unaccepted/freed memory ranges that could lead to system crashes and memory corruption. The commit message explicitly states this "leads memblock_phys_free() to throw the first 4 MiB of physical memory to the wolves" - indicating serious memory corruption with security implications.
83518453074d1 x86/amd_node: Add SMN offsets to exclusive region access
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and kernel security mechanisms, I can now provide my assessment. **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Proactive Security Hardening**: This commit implements proactive security measures to prevent potential race conditions between kernel and userspace access to SMN (System Management Network) registers at offsets 0x60 and 0x64. It's a preventive measure, not a fix for an exploitable vulnerability. 2. **Defense-in-Depth**: The code adds multiple layers of protection: - Uses `pci_request_config_region_exclusive()` to reserve PCI config space - Adds `smn_exclusive` flag check that blocks operations if exclusivity cannot be established - Taints the kernel (`TAINT_USER`) when userspace tries to access reserved regions, providing visibility 3. **No Direct Exploitable Path**: The commit doesn't fix a direct security vulnerability. Instead, it prevents potential hardware malfunctions that could occur if userspace and kernel simultaneously access the same PCI config registers. The "malfunction" mentioned in the commit message refers to hardware-level conflicts, not security exploits. 4. **Existing Protections**: The kernel already has `security_locked_down(LOCKDOWN_PCI_ACCESS)` checks for PCI access, and this commit builds upon those existing protections. 5. **Similar Pattern in Reference Commits**: Looking at the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this follows similar patterns of hardware-specific fixes and preventive measures that don't constitute exploitable security vulnerabilities. The commit is a responsible security hardening measure but does not fix an exploitable vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
7a2ad752746bf x86/smpboot: Fix INIT delay assignment for extended Intel Families
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit in question: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit addresses a boot performance optimization issue, not a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit modifies the condition for skipping CPU initialization delays during SMP boot. It changes from checking only Intel Family 6 CPUs (`boot_cpu_data.x86 == 6`) to checking Intel Family 6 and beyond (`boot_cpu_data.x86_vfm >= INTEL_PENTIUM_PRO`). 2. **Security impact**: This change has no security implications: - It only affects boot timing delays for CPU initialization - It doesn't change access controls, memory management, or any security-critical paths - The delay being modified is purely for hardware compatibility with older CPUs during SMP boot 3. **Risk assessment**: - The change could theoretically affect system stability if newer Intel processors (Family 18/19) actually need the delay, but this would result in boot failures, not security vulnerabilities - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant attack vectors are introduced or fixed 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: This matches the pattern of commits marked "CVE Status: NO" in the examples - it's a hardware compatibility/performance fix rather than a security fix. 5. **Code context**: Looking at the broader codebase, this is part of a series by the same author modernizing Intel CPU family checks using the new VFM (Vendor-Family-Model) system, which is a code cleanup/modernization effort, not security-related. The commit fixes a boot performance regression for newer Intel processors but has no security implications.
8a141be3233af x86/headers: Replace __ASSEMBLY__ with __ASSEMBLER__ in UAPI headers
- [sasha] NO This commit changes `__ASSEMBLY__` to `__ASSEMBLER__` in x86 UAPI headers. This is a purely cosmetic/compatibility improvement with no security implications: 1. **No security-sensitive code changes**: The changes only affect preprocessor conditionals that control which parts of header files are included when compiling assembly vs C code. 2. **Consistent behavior preserved**: Both `__ASSEMBLY__` and `__ASSEMBLER__` serve the same purpose - to exclude C-specific structures and includes when compiling assembly code. The actual conditional logic and what gets excluded/included remains identical. 3. **Improves userspace compatibility**: `__ASSEMBLER__` is automatically defined by GCC when compiling assembly-with-cpp, while `__ASSEMBLY__` is only defined by the kernel's Makefile. This change makes UAPI headers more usable for userspace applications that don't define `__ASSEMBLY__` themselves. 4. **No functional changes**: The commit only changes the macro name in conditional preprocessor directives (`#ifndef __ASSEMBLY__` → `#ifndef __ASSEMBLER__`). The same code sections are protected/exposed in both cases. Similar to the reference commits which were purely refactoring changes (moving definitions, fixing whitespace, replacing hardcoded values), this commit improves code maintainability without introducing any security vulnerabilities or changing kernel behavior.
7e6b0a2e4152f x86/microcode: Update the Intel processor flag scan check
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, examining the kernel source code, and understanding the microcode subsystem: **NO** This commit fixes a logic bug in CPU family/model detection for microcode loading, but it should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Limited Impact Scope**: The bug primarily affects very old processors (Intel Family 5 = early Pentiums from the 1990s) that attempted to read MSR 0x17 (MSR_IA32_PLATFORM_ID) when they shouldn't. Modern systems are unlikely to encounter this issue. 2. **Correctness Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The original condition `if (x86_model(sig->sig) >= 5 || x86_family(sig->sig) > 6)` incorrectly allowed Family 5 processors with model >= 5 to attempt reading an unsupported MSR. The fix properly restricts this to Family 6, Model 5+ (Pentium III Deschutes and later) that actually support this MSR. 3. **No Direct Exploitation Vector**: While the bug could cause system instability or microcode loading issues on affected old hardware, there's no clear path for an attacker to exploit this for privilege escalation or unauthorized access. 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits involving CPU model identification, microcode handling, and Intel family definitions have "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of correctness fix typically doesn't warrant CVE assignment. 5. **System Reliability vs. Security**: The primary risk is system crashes or incorrect microcode selection on very old hardware, which is a reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously. The commit properly fixes a long-standing logic error in CPU identification for microcode loading, but represents a reliability improvement rather than a security fix requiring CVE tracking.
91d5451d97ce3 x86/stackprotector/64: Only export __ref_stack_chk_guard on CONFIG_SMP
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me analyze this: ## Analysis **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Build Fix, Not Security Fix**: This is purely a compilation error fix. The commit message states "The __ref_stack_chk_guard symbol doesn't exist on UP" and shows a compilation error. This is fixing a build-time issue, not a runtime security vulnerability. 2. **Stack Protector Functionality Unchanged**: The fix only adds the correct conditional compilation guards (`CONFIG_SMP`) around the symbol export. The actual stack protection functionality remains identical - no security behavior is being changed. 3. **No Security Impact**: - On SMP systems: The symbol was already correctly exported and working - On UP systems: The symbol doesn't exist (and shouldn't exist based on the code in common.c:2240-2244), so this just fixes the incorrect export that was causing build failures 4. **Context from Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all involve build system fixes, compilation issues, or toolchain compatibility problems - none received CVEs because they don't fix actual security vulnerabilities. 5. **Code Analysis**: The fix in `arch/x86/entry/entry.S` at line 68 changes: ``` #ifdef CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR ``` to: ``` #if defined(CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR) && defined(CONFIG_SMP) ``` This matches the logic in `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c` where `__stack_chk_guard` is only exported on non-SMP systems (`#ifndef CONFIG_SMP`), and the linker script provides the alias unconditionally. The fix ensures build consistency but doesn't change any security-relevant behavior or fix any vulnerability that could be exploited.
2d5630b0c9466 wifi: mt76: mt7925: fix fails to enter low power mode in suspend state
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit addresses a power management timing issue during suspend, not a security vulnerability. The change removes the ACK flag (`uni_txd->option &= ~MCU_CMD_ACK`) for the `MCU_UNI_CMD(HIF_CTRL)` command to prevent the firmware from sending an additional ACK event that could cause timing issues. 2. **Code Analysis**: Looking at lines 3308-3309 in `/drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7925/mcu.c`, the change is a simple flag modification: ```c if (cmd == MCU_UNI_CMD(HIF_CTRL)) uni_txd->option &= ~MCU_CMD_ACK; ``` This clears the `MCU_CMD_ACK` bit from the command options for HIF_CTRL commands. 3. **Impact Assessment**: The issue being fixed is that the device "sometimes fails to enter low power mode during suspend" due to a timing race condition where an ACK event may not reach the host. This is a reliability/power management issue, not a security issue. 4. **No Security Implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or bounds checking issues - No access control or privilege escalation concerns - No input validation problems - No race conditions that could lead to security vulnerabilities - The change only affects power management behavior during suspend 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") deal with power management, timing, and MLO functionality fixes - none were security-related, which aligns with this commit's nature. This is a straightforward power management fix to improve suspend reliability, not a security vulnerability.
bf39813599b03 wifi: mt76: mt7925: Simplify HIF suspend handling to avoid suspend fail
- [sasha] Let me examine the changes more directly. Looking at the commit diff: **Analysis of the commit:** The key changes are in the `mt7925_mcu_handle_hif_ctrl_basic` function: **Before:** ```c if (basic->hifsuspend) { if (basic->hif_tx_traffic_status == HIF_TRAFFIC_IDLE && basic->hif_rx_traffic_status == HIF_TRAFFIC_IDLE) /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var success linux/ dev->hif_idle = true; else /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var busy linux/ /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var invalid linux/ dev->hif_idle = false; } else { dev->hif_resumed = true; } ``` **After:** ```c if (basic->hifsuspend) { dev->hif_idle = true; if (!(basic->hif_tx_traffic_status == HIF_TRAFFIC_IDLE && basic->hif_rx_traffic_status == HIF_TRAFFIC_IDLE)) dev_info(dev->mt76.dev, "Hif traffic not idle.\n"); } else { dev->hif_resumed = true; } ``` **Security Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the change**: This commit modifies the HIF (Host Interface) suspend handling logic. Previously, the system would only mark `dev->hif_idle = true` if both TX and RX traffic were idle. Now it unconditionally sets `dev->hif_idle = true` regardless of traffic status. 2. **Security implications**: - This change relaxes a condition that was previously enforcing proper traffic idle state before suspending - It allows the system to proceed with suspend even when traffic is not idle - However, this appears to be intentional to prevent suspend failures, not to fix a security vulnerability 3. **Context from commit message**: The commit explicitly states this is to "avoid suspend fail" and that "System suspend failures may occur due to inappropriate handling of traffic not idle event by the WiFi driver." 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All 5 similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and appear to be reliability/functionality fixes rather than security fixes. 5. **No security-sensitive operations**: The change doesn't involve: - Memory corruption fixes - Access control changes - Input validation improvements - Buffer overflow prevention - Privilege escalation fixes **NO** This commit fixes a reliability issue with system suspend, not a security vulnerability. The change relaxes a condition to prevent suspend failures, which is a power management/functionality fix rather than a security fix. The commit message explicitly describes this as addressing "suspend failures" rather than any security concern, and the code changes don't show patterns typical of security fixes (no buffer bounds checking, access control, or memory safety improvements).
a77749b3e2181 btrfs: send: return -ENAMETOOLONG when attempting a path that is too long
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and detailed examination of the kernel tree context, my determination is: **NO** **Explanation:** This commit is a pure bug fix that improves error handling semantics without fixing any security vulnerability. The key evidence: 1. **Error Code Semantics Fix**: The change corrects misleading error reporting by returning `-ENAMETOOLONG` (appropriate for path length violations) instead of `-ENOMEM` (which suggests memory allocation failure). This is purely about accurate error reporting. 2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The function `fs_path_ensure_buf()` in `fs/btrfs/send.c` performs input validation on path lengths, not security-critical operations. Both error codes (`-ENOMEM` and `-ENAMETOOLONG`) are standard errno values that don't reveal sensitive information. 3. **Improvement, Not Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is about making error reporting "less odd and misleading" - this indicates it's an improvement rather than fixing a vulnerability that could be exploited. 4. **Pattern Consistency**: Analysis of the kernel tree shows that btrfs send code already returns `-ENAMETOOLONG` in similar contexts (like `iterate_dir_item`), making this change about consistency rather than security. 5. **No Exploitable Condition**: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (which removed dangerous `BUG_ON()` calls that could cause kernel panics), this commit only changes which error code is returned - it doesn't prevent crashes, memory corruption, or other exploitable conditions. The change actually has a slight positive security impact by providing more precise error semantics for security monitoring tools, but it doesn't address any existing vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
f2027ef3f733d wifi: mt76: mt7925: load the appropriate CLC data based on hardware type
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this commit carefully: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit adds functionality to read hardware type information from EEPROM and use it to filter CLC (Country Location Configuration) data based on hardware encapsulation type. Here's my assessment: 1. **Security Context**: The commit adds a new function `mt7925_mcu_read_eeprom()` and modifies `mt7925_load_clc()` to filter CLC data based on hardware type read from EEPROM. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - **EEPROM Reading**: The new `mt7925_mcu_read_eeprom()` function uses proper bounds checking with `round_down(offset, MT7925_EEPROM_BLOCK_SIZE)` and accesses data via `offset % MT7925_EEPROM_BLOCK_SIZE`, which prevents buffer overflows. - **CLC Filtering**: The added check `if (u8_get_bits(clc->type, MT_EE_HW_TYPE_ENCAP) != hw_encap)` simply skips CLC entries that don't match the hardware type - this is a filtering mechanism, not a security fix. 3. **Security Implications**: - The EEPROM reading is properly bounded and doesn't introduce memory safety issues - The filtering logic adds a validation step but doesn't fix a pre-existing vulnerability - No indication of fixing buffer overflows, access control issues, or other security vulnerabilities - The commit message describes this as a feature enhancement to "load the appropriate CLC data based on hardware type" 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Unlike commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (like the off-by-one fixes), this doesn't fix bounds checking errors - Similar to commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (like removing unused ACPI functions), this is a functionality improvement rather than a security fix 5. **No Security Keywords**: The commit message and code don't mention security concerns, vulnerabilities, or fixes for potential exploits. This commit appears to be a legitimate feature enhancement to ensure proper CLC data loading based on hardware type, without addressing any security vulnerabilities.
cda76788f8b0f btrfs: fix non-empty delayed iputs list on unmount due to async workers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, along with exploration of the kernel tree: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Configuration Dependent Impact**: The assertion failure only causes a system crash when `CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT` is enabled, which is disabled by default and intended only for development/debugging purposes. In production kernels, the assertion is a no-op. 2. **Similar Precedent**: This is nearly identical to "Similar Commit 1" which was marked as NO CVE. Both involve race conditions during unmount that can cause the same assertion failure: `ASSERT(list_empty(&fs_info->delayed_iputs))`. 3. **Robustness Fix vs Security Issue**: The code changes in `fs/btrfs/disk-io.c` add `btrfs_flush_workqueue(fs_info->workers)` to ensure proper ordering during shutdown. This is a robustness improvement to prevent assertion failures rather than fixing a memory safety vulnerability. 4. **No Memory Safety Violations**: Unlike the similar commits marked as CVE-worthy (which involved use-after-free and memory corruption), this commit only addresses an assertion failure with no indication of actual memory safety issues. 5. **Limited Exploitability**: The race condition requires specific timing during unmount with IO errors, making it difficult to reliably exploit even when assertions are enabled. The commit message focuses on preventing assertion failures during filesystem shutdown rather than addressing security concerns, and the fix is essentially adding proper synchronization during the unmount process - characteristic of a reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability.
8d38abdf6c182 wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix SER reset trigger on WED reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel codebase, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Code Analysis 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit modifies an enum value and changes one parameter in a function call: - Adds `UNI_CMD_SER_SET_RECOVER_FROM_ETH` enum value - Changes `UNI_CMD_SER_SET_RECOVER_L1` to `UNI_CMD_SER_SET_RECOVER_FROM_ETH` in `mt7996_mmio_wed_reset()` 2. **Context**: This is in the mt7996 WiFi driver's WED (WiFi Ethernet Dispatcher) reset functionality, specifically in the SER (System Error Recovery) subsystem. 3. **Purpose**: The commit improves hardware reset reliability by using a more specific firmware trigger when WED is being reset due to ethernet reset conditions. ## Security Assessment **No Security Vulnerability Present**: - This is a **proactive improvement** to prevent L1 SER failures, not a fix for an existing vulnerability - The change is in **error recovery logic** - making recovery more reliable, not fixing a security flaw - No evidence of **exploitable conditions** - this is hardware state management - The commit message indicates this is **preventive** ("helps prevent further L1 SER failure") - **No access control, memory safety, or privilege issues** are being addressed ## Comparison with Similar Commits The provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO) also deal with: - Hardware reset improvements - Recovery flow adjustments - Firmware synchronization fixes - Power management optimizations None address security vulnerabilities, consistent with this commit. ## Conclusion This is a hardware reliability improvement in the WiFi driver's error recovery system, not a security fix. It enhances the robustness of the reset mechanism but does not address any security vulnerability.
24a295e4ef1ca x86/headers: Replace __ASSEMBLY__ with __ASSEMBLER__ in non-UAPI headers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now make a determination about whether it should be assigned a CVE. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **This is a cosmetic/standardization change**: The commit message clearly states this is about standardizing on the `__ASSEMBLER__` macro that is "provided by the compilers" rather than the kernel-defined `__ASSEMBLY__` macro. The commit message explicitly describes this as moving from "kernelspace coding" to using compiler-standard macros. 2. **No security vulnerability is being fixed**: The changes are purely textual replacements changing `#ifndef __ASSEMBLY__` to `#ifndef __ASSEMBLER__` and similar patterns. There's no indication in either the commit message or code changes that any security issue existed or is being resolved. 3. **Pattern matches similar non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical examples provided, this follows the same pattern as other commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a cleanup/standardization change (like the whitespace fix, header organization, and build system improvements in the examples). 4. **No functional behavior change**: The code changes are mechanical text substitutions that don't alter the logic or functionality of any security-critical code paths. The conditional compilation behavior remains the same, just using a different (compiler-standard) macro. 5. **No mention of security concerns**: Unlike commits that fix security vulnerabilities, there's no mention in the commit message of fixing bugs, addressing security issues, or preventing potential exploits. This is clearly a code maintenance and standardization effort, not a security fix, and therefore does not warrant CVE assignment.
0c5a89ceddc17 wifi: mt76: only mark tx-status-failed frames as ACKed on mt76x0/2
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does **not** warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary **What the commit does:** 1. Introduces a new driver flag `MT_DRV_IGNORE_TXS_FAILED` 2. Sets this flag for older mt76x0 and mt76x2 chipsets only 3. Modifies the tx status handling logic to conditionally mark failed transmissions as ACKed only for these older chips **Code Changes Analysis:** - In `tx.c`, the logic now checks both `MT_TX_CB_TXS_FAILED` AND the new driver flag before marking frames as ACKed - The change is **more restrictive**, not less - it limits the "mark as ACKed" behavior to only specific older chipsets - For newer chips, failed transmissions will correctly be reported as failed **Security Implications:** 1. **No privilege escalation** - This is an internal driver implementation detail 2. **No access control bypass** - Does not affect authentication or authorization 3. **No buffer overflow or memory corruption** - Only changes flag logic 4. **No user input validation issues** - Internal driver state management **The Issue Being Fixed:** - **Reliability Issue**: Older mt76x0/x2 chips have unreliable interrupt status polling that can lose status events - **False Negative Problem**: On newer chips, timeout was incorrectly being treated as ACK when it should indicate failure - **Station Management**: The commit message mentions "fixes issues with inactivity polling" - this suggests the false ACKs were preventing proper detection of inactive stations **Why This Is Not a Security Vulnerability:** 1. This is a **reliability/correctness fix**, not a security fix 2. The change makes the behavior **more accurate** for newer hardware 3. No mention of security implications in commit message or code 4. Similar to the provided examples (all marked CVE Status: NO) which are also driver correctness fixes 5. The fix actually **improves** the accuracy of transmission status reporting This is a typical driver reliability improvement that enhances the accuracy of wireless frame transmission status reporting, particularly for station activity monitoring.
86db2c5d4ed39 wifi: mt76: mt7996: implement driver specific get_txpower function
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue clearly. The `mt76_vif_phy` function returns NULL when `mlink->ctx` is NULL (line 830-831), which means the vif doesn't have a channel context assigned. In the generic `mt76_get_txpower`, this causes an -EINVAL error to be returned. The new `mt7996_get_txpower` function adds a fallback mechanism: when the phy is NULL, it searches through the radio mask to find an appropriate phy to use for power reporting. Now let me analyze if this is a security issue: **CVE Status Analysis:** **NO** **Explanation:** This commit addresses a **functional issue**, not a security vulnerability. The analysis shows: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit replaces a function that would return `-EINVAL` (causing txpower queries to fail) with one that provides a fallback mechanism to find an appropriate phy when the vif lacks a channel context. 2. **No security implications**: - The failure mode is a simple error return (-EINVAL), not a crash, memory corruption, or privilege escalation - The fix improves functionality by providing better txpower reporting for vifs without channel contexts - There's no indication of buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control bypasses, or other security-relevant patterns 3. **Comparison with similar commits**: The provided similar commits that received CVE status (commits 1 & 2) were fixing potential **driver crashes** due to "uninitialized private data" when passing stopped vifs to drivers. This commit, in contrast, fixes a functional reporting issue without any crash risk. 4. **Impact**: The bug would cause txpower queries to fail for certain vif configurations, which is a functionality problem but poses no security risk to the system. This is a functional improvement to handle edge cases in txpower reporting, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
3ba20af886d1f wifi: mt76: scan: set vif offchannel link for scanning/roc
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because it is a feature enhancement, not a security vulnerability fix. **Analysis:** 1. **Commit Purpose**: The commit message is brief but clearly states it's about setting the "vif offchannel link for scanning/roc" because "The driver needs to know what vif link to use." This indicates it's implementing missing functionality rather than fixing a security issue. 2. **Code Changes**: The changes are additive and constructive: - Addition of a new `offchannel_link` field to track offchannel operations - Proper assignment: `rcu_assign_pointer(mvif->offchannel_link, mlink);` - Proper cleanup: `rcu_assign_pointer(mvif->offchannel_link, NULL);` - Addition of an `offchannel` flag to `mt76_wcid` structure 3. **No Security Fix Pattern**: Unlike the CVE-marked similar commits that show clear bug fixes (NULL pointer checks, use-after-free fixes), this commit is implementing new functionality for Multi-Link Operation (MLO) support. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" show clear vulnerability fixes (NULL deref checks, wrong pointer usage) - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" show feature additions or minor corrections - This commit follows the "NO" pattern - it's adding infrastructure for proper vif link management 5. **No Error Handling**: The code doesn't show any error conditions being fixed or dangerous states being prevented - it's setting up proper state tracking. This is new functionality being added to support proper vif link management during offchannel operations (scanning/ROC), not a fix for an existing vulnerability.
9890624c1b394 wifi: mt76: Check link_conf pointer in mt76_connac_mcu_sta_basic_tlv()
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the function's first line after the change: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit is a **defensive programming fix** to prevent a potential null pointer dereference, not a fix for an existing security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds a null pointer check (`link_conf &&`) before dereferencing `link_conf->bssid` in line 394 of `mt76_connac_mcu_sta_basic_tlv()`. 2. **Context**: This is marked as "a preliminary patch to introduce MLO support for MT7996 driver" - it's preparing the code for Multi-Link Operation (MLO) support, not fixing an existing bug. 3. **Function signature**: The function takes `link_conf` as a parameter, and line 376 shows `struct ieee80211_vif *vif = link_conf->vif;` - this line would crash immediately if `link_conf` were NULL, making the fix at line 394 somewhat redundant unless the function signature changes later. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits are marked as "CVE Status: NO" and are related to MLO feature additions/improvements, not security fixes. 5. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit message doesn't mention any security concerns, crashes, or vulnerabilities being fixed. It's purely for MLO feature preparation. 6. **Pattern of the change**: This follows the pattern of other defensive null checks being added to prepare code for new functionality, rather than fixing an exploitable condition. The change prevents a potential future null pointer dereference during MLO implementation work, but there's no evidence this represents a current exploitable vulnerability or that it fixes a security issue.
0efc297a3c497 cgroup/rstat: avoid disabling irqs for O(num_cpu)
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a performance and system stability improvement, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses interrupt latency issues where interrupts could be disabled for up to 45+ milliseconds on large systems (400+ CPUs). 2. **No Security Boundary Violation**: - The `cgroup_rstat_flush()` function is triggered by legitimate operations like reading `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.stat` - There's no privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or bypass of security controls - The function requires legitimate access to cgroup interfaces 3. **Impact Analysis**: - **Before fix**: Long interrupt disabled periods (45+ ms) could cause network packet drops and system responsiveness issues - **After fix**: IRQs are disabled for much shorter periods (4ms), improving system responsiveness - This affects **availability** but not **confidentiality** or **integrity** 4. **Code Changes**: - The fix simply removes the conditional check `if (need_resched() || spin_needbreak(&cgroup_rstat_lock))` - Now the lock is **always** dropped and reacquired for each CPU iteration - This changes the locking granularity from "all CPUs at once" to "per-CPU" to reduce IRQ-off time 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar commits that were assigned CVE (commits 3 & 4) involved DoS through hard lockups where malicious actors could trigger O(NR_CPUS linux NR_THREADS) spinning - This commit doesn't involve malicious triggering - it's about legitimate operations causing performance issues 6. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this for malicious purposes beyond what they could already do with legitimate cgroup access. This is a **performance optimization** and **system stability improvement**, not a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
86bc882170066 staging: vchiq_arm: Create keep-alive thread during probe
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit more carefully by understanding what the code change does: **Analysis of the Commit:** Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, this commit is **NOT** fixing a security vulnerability. Here's why: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** 1. **Nature of Changes**: This commit is a code refactoring that moves the keep-alive thread creation from `vchiq_platform_conn_state_changed()` to `vchiq_platform_init_state()` during probe time. 2. **Purpose**: The commit message explicitly states this is for: - Better error handling during probe (abort if kthread_create fails) - Making resource release process easier - More consistent behavior 3. **No Security Fix**: Unlike the reference commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed null pointer dereferences that could cause crashes, this commit doesn't fix any existing vulnerability. It's purely a structural improvement. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - Similar commits 1 & 2 (CVE Status: YES) fixed null pointer dereferences with `IS_ERR_OR_NULL()` checks - Similar commits 3, 4 & 5 (CVE Status: NO) were code improvements, resource management fixes, and refactoring - This commit falls into the latter category 5. **Code Analysis**: The changes show: - Moving `kthread_create()` call from connection state change to initialization - Better error propagation during probe - No fixes for buffer overflows, memory corruption, access control issues, or other security-relevant patterns This is a code quality improvement and refactoring change, not a security fix. Therefore, it should not be assigned a CVE.
9291ea091b29b s390/tlb: Use mm_has_pgste() instead of mm_alloc_pgste()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this s390 TLB management commit, I need to examine the security implications carefully. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Understanding the Change The commit changes the condition in `pte_free_tlb()` from `mm_alloc_pgste(tlb->mm)` to `mm_has_pgste(tlb->mm)` for calling `gmap_unlink()`. Based on my analysis of the s390 code: - `mm_has_pgste()` checks if PGSTE (Page Guest Storage Table Extensions) is actually enabled for a specific mm_struct - `gmap_unlink()` manages KVM guest address space mappings - The issue was that `gmap_unlink()` was being called even when no actual guest mappings existed to unlink ## Security Analysis **Why this is likely NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Nature of the fix**: This is primarily a correctness improvement to avoid unnecessary operations, not fixing memory corruption or access control issues 2. **gmap_unlink() behavior**: The function iterates over `mm->context.gmap_list` and should handle empty lists gracefully. When PGSTE isn't enabled, this list should be empty, making the function essentially a no-op 3. **Limited attack surface**: The issue only affects s390 KVM guest mapping management in specific virtualization scenarios 4. **Pattern matching**: Comparing to the provided similar commits, most correctness fixes in TLB/memory management are marked "NO" for CVE assignment unless they involve exploitable memory corruption or privilege escalation 5. **Resource management**: While calling `gmap_unlink()` unnecessarily wastes resources, it's unlikely to cause exploitable security issues The commit message indicates this is about "limiting calls to gmap_unlink() to those cases where there might be something to unlink" - which suggests an optimization/correctness fix rather than addressing a security vulnerability that could lead to guest escape, memory corruption, or privilege escalation.
9c05636ca72a2 drm/amdgpu: Skip pcie_replay_count sysfs creation for VF
- [sasha] Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me analyze the security implications: **Analysis:** This commit fixes a situation where Virtual Functions (VFs) in a SR-IOV virtualized environment were attempting to access the NAK_COUNTER register via sysfs, but VFs don't have permission to read this register directly. The register access would likely fail or potentially cause issues. **Key Points:** 1. **What the commit does:** - Prevents creation of the `pcie_replay_count` sysfs file for Virtual Functions (VFs) - The sysfs file allows reading PCIe replay counts from the NAK_COUNTER register - VFs should only access this information through PMFW (Power Management Firmware) metrics 2. **Security Context:** - This is about access control in a virtualized environment - VFs are restricted from directly accessing certain hardware registers - The commit enforces proper access boundaries between VFs and physical hardware 3. **Comparing to similar commits:** - All 5 similar commits are marked "CVE Status: NO" - They are all minor fixes or feature additions without security implications - None involve access control violations or potential privilege escalation **Security Assessment:** This commit does NOT warrant a CVE because: 1. **No vulnerability being fixed:** This prevents a functionality issue (VFs accessing registers they can't read), not a security vulnerability 2. **Access control enforcement:** The commit actually strengthens security by enforcing proper access boundaries, rather than fixing a weakness 3. **No privilege escalation:** VFs already cannot access the register - this just prevents the failed attempt and improves error handling 4. **Information disclosure is minimal:** The NAK counter provides PCIe retry statistics, which is operational/diagnostic information, not sensitive security data 5. **Administrative context:** In SR-IOV environments, the hypervisor/host already controls VF access to hardware resources **NO** This commit enforces proper access control in a virtualized environment by preventing VFs from attempting to access hardware registers they cannot read, rather than fixing a security vulnerability. It's a defensive programming improvement that prevents operational issues and strengthens the access control model, but does not address any exploitable security weakness.
593c829b4326f wifi: mt76: mt7996: revise TXS size
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Technical Analysis The commit changes TXS (TX Status) processing from using hardcoded values to proper constants: - Changes `rxd += 4; rxd + 8 <= end; rxd += 8` to `rxd += MT_TXS_HDR_SIZE; rxd + MT_TXS_SIZE <= end; rxd += MT_TXS_SIZE` - Where `MT_TXS_HDR_SIZE = 4` (same as before) and `MT_TXS_SIZE = 12` (was 8) ## Security Assessment **This is a correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix:** 1. **Proper Bounds Checking Maintained**: The loop still has explicit boundary checks (`rxd + MT_TXS_SIZE <= end`) that prevent buffer overruns 2. **Hardware Specification Compliance**: The change corrects the TXS processing to match the actual hardware specification (12 DWs total, not 8 DWs) 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: - The boundary calculation `end = (__le32 *)&rxd[len / 4]` is based on actual received data length - The code only reads data within the validated boundaries - No writes occur in this processing path 4. **Improves Code Quality**: Replaces magic numbers with proper symbolic constants, reducing the chance of future errors ## Comparison with Similar Commits The provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show similar patterns: - Performance optimizations and correctness fixes - Data structure size corrections - Hardware specification compliance changes - No security implications ## Conclusion This commit fixes incorrect TXS structure size assumptions to match hardware specifications. It maintains all existing safety checks while improving correctness. The change reduces rather than introduces security risk by ensuring proper data structure alignment and processing.
31e75ed964582 mmc: host: Wait for Vdd to settle on card power off
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual security implications. Based on my analysis: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a hardware timing compliance fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses an SD specification compliance issue where voltage needs to drain to below 0.5V for at least 1ms during power-off on specific Intel hardware (Apollo Lake and Bay Trail). 2. **Limited Hardware Scope**: The fix is narrowly targeted to specific Intel PCI device IDs (PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_APL_SD and PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_BYT_SD), indicating this is a hardware-specific timing quirk rather than a fundamental security flaw. 3. **No Security Impact**: - The change only adds a `usleep_range(15000, 17500)` delay during power-off - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypass - No sensitive data exposure or denial of service implications - The issue is about proper card power-down sequencing per SD specification 4. **Similar Pattern Analysis**: Comparing to the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), this follows the same pattern of hardware-specific fixes and power management improvements that don't constitute security vulnerabilities. 5. **Code Change Assessment**: The modification in `drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-pci-core.c:614-616` simply adds a conditional delay during power-off for specific hardware. This is a reliability/compliance fix, not a security patch. The commit addresses proper SD card power-off sequencing according to the SD specification, ensuring cards can power off correctly on problematic Intel hardware platforms, but has no security implications.
0fb482728ba1e pidfs: improve multi-threaded exec and premature thread-group leader exit polling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here is my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it addresses a **functional correctness issue** in pidfd polling behavior for multi-threaded processes. Here's why this should not receive a CVE: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit improves the consistency of polling behavior for pidfd file descriptors during multi-threaded exec and premature thread-group leader exit scenarios. This is a behavioral correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **No security boundaries crossed**: The changes modify when poll notifications are sent to userspace processes, but do not affect: - Memory safety (no buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - Access controls or privilege escalation - Information disclosure - Resource exhaustion or denial of service 3. **Code changes are logic improvements**: The key changes are: - In `pidfd_poll()`: Replace `(thread || thread_group_empty(task))` with `!delay_group_leader(task)` - In `exit_notify()`: Replace `!thread_group_empty(tsk)` with `!delay_group_leader(tsk)` These changes ensure that poll notifications are only sent when appropriate, preventing inconsistent behavior between different timing scenarios. 4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the provided similar commits (Similar Commits 1-5) have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar pidfd/process management improvements that are functional rather than security-related. 5. **Impact is behavioral consistency**: The commit message clearly states this addresses "inconsistencies for pidfd polling" - making the behavior more predictable and correct, but not fixing any exploitable security issue. This is a quality-of-implementation fix that improves API consistency rather than a security patch.
6c4d5aadf5df3 PCI: vmd: Disable MSI remapping bypass under Xen
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context from the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **1. Nature of the Change:** The commit disables the MSI remapping bypass feature (VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP) when running under Xen by adding the line: ```c features &= ~VMD_FEAT_CAN_BYPASS_MSI_REMAP; ``` **2. Security Context:** - This is a **hardening/compatibility fix**, not a vulnerability fix - It addresses a **functional incompatibility** between VMD MSI bypass and Xen's interrupt management - The commit **prevents** a potentially problematic configuration rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability **3. Impact Analysis:** - When the bypass is disabled, the system falls back to the standard VMD MSI remapping mode - This fallback mode "must always be supported by VMD bridges" according to the commit message - No security boundaries are crossed; it's purely an operational/compatibility issue **4. Comparison to Similar Commits:** Looking at the historical examples, this most closely resembles the "NO CVE" commits which involve: - Feature disabling for compatibility (like Similar Commit 1) - Hardware configuration adjustments (like Similar Commits 2, 4) - Hardening measures without fixing actual vulnerabilities **5. Code Analysis:** The change is defensive - it prevents a configuration that won't work properly under Xen rather than fixing a security flaw. The MSI bypass feature is optional, and disabling it doesn't create or fix a security vulnerability. This is a compatibility/hardening commit, not a security vulnerability fix.
ef1d3455bbc19 libnvdimm/labels: Fix divide error in nd_label_data_init()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me create a brief summary of this security vulnerability: **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Division by Zero Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a division by zero error in `nd_label_data_init()` that occurs when `max_xfer` is 0, which is derived from a faulty CXL device's LSA (Label Storage Area) size. 2. **Attack Vector**: A malicious or faulty CXL memory device can return `lsa_size = 0` in response to the "Identify Memory Device" command (CXL spec 3.1, 8.2.9.9.1.1). This value propagates as: - `mds->lsa_size = 0` (from device) - `config_size = mds->lsa_size = 0` (in CXL driver at `drivers/cxl/pmem.c:180`) - `max_xfer = min_t(size_t, ndd->nsarea.max_xfer, config_size) = 0` - `DIV_ROUND_UP(read_size, max_xfer)` causes division by zero at `drivers/nvdimm/label.c:491` 3. **Security Impact**: - **Denial of Service**: Kernel oops/crash via division by zero - **System Stability**: Affects critical memory subsystem (NVDIMM/CXL) - **Privilege Context**: Triggered in kernel space during device probe 4. **Triggerable Condition**: The vulnerability is triggered during the NVDIMM device probe process when a CXL device is attached, making it accessible through hardware interaction. 5. **Comparison to Similar CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 2-5, all of which received CVEs for division by zero vulnerabilities that could be triggered by user/device input. The fix correctly adds a check for `ndd->nsarea.config_size == 0` to the existing validation, preventing the division by zero while maintaining the same error path.
13b4c81083cc4 wifi: mt76: mt7996: use the correct vif link for scanning/roc
- [sasha] Now let me examine the specific security implications of the commit. Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader context: **CVE Status: NO** ## Analysis This commit **should NOT be assigned a CVE** for the following reasons: ### 1. **Nature of the Fix** The commit fixes a **functional bug**, not a security vulnerability. It corrects link selection logic for offchannel operations (scanning/remain-on-channel) by ensuring the correct VIF link is used. ### 2. **Code Changes Analysis** The key changes are: - **Before**: Always used `deflink` for all operations - **After**: Properly checks `wcid->offchannel` flag and uses `offchannel_link` when appropriate, falling back to `deflink` ```c // New logic adds proper link selection: if (wcid->offchannel) mlink = rcu_dereference(mvif->mt76.offchannel_link); if (!mlink) mlink = &mvif->deflink.mt76; ``` ### 3. **Security Context** - **Access control**: Offchannel operations require `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability at the nl80211 level - **Authorization**: The fix ensures operations use the correct link context, which **improves** security by preventing unintended cross-link operations - **No privilege escalation**: The fix doesn't change who can perform operations, only ensures they use the correct link ### 4. **Impact Assessment** - **Before fix**: Wrong link used for offchannel TX operations → functional issues, not security issues - **After fix**: Correct link used → proper operation isolation - **No security boundary crossed**: Both links belong to the same VIF with same privilege level ### 5. **Comparison to CVE Examples** - Unlike Similar Commit 3 & 4 (NULL deref check - **CVE Status: YES**), this doesn't fix a crash/memory safety issue - Like Similar Commits 1, 2 & 5 (**CVE Status: NO**), this is a functional correctness fix ### 6. **No Security Vulnerability Indicators** - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or crashes fixed - No access control bypasses resolved - No input validation improvements - No race conditions addressed - No privilege escalation fixes This is a quality/correctness improvement that ensures scanning and remain-on-channel operations use the appropriate link context, but it doesn't fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
5b5f1ca9ce73a wifi: mt76: scan: fix setting tx_info fields
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and the kernel codebase, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis **What the commit fixes:** The commit fixes an initialization order bug where transmission control flags (`IEEE80211_TX_CTL_NO_CCK_RATE` and `IEEE80211_TX_CTRL_DONT_USE_RATE_MASK`) were being set **before** calling `ieee80211_tx_prepare_skb()`, which can overwrite or clear the SKB control buffer during TX preparation. **Why this is NOT CVE-worthy:** 1. **No Memory Corruption**: Unlike the CVE-worthy similar commits that involved DMA unmapping issues and uninitialized memory usage, this is purely a flag ordering issue with no memory safety implications. 2. **Limited Security Impact**: The impact is restricted to: - Incorrect WiFi transmission rate selection during scanning - Potential protocol violations in P2P scenarios - No information disclosure, privilege escalation, or system compromise 3. **Functional Bug vs Security Vulnerability**: This is primarily a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The flags control transmission behavior but don't expose sensitive data or create attack vectors. 4. **Comparison to CVE Examples**: The provided CVE-worthy examples involved: - Uninitialized data potentially containing sensitive information - DMA mapping leaks that could lead to memory corruption - This commit only affects transmission control flag persistence **Key difference**: While the similar commits involved uninitialized data that could contain sensitive information from previous operations, this commit only affects the preservation of specific transmission control flags that don't expose sensitive data. The fix is important for correct Wi-Fi operation but doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
aa42add73ce9b pNFS/flexfiles: Report ENETDOWN as a connection error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Code Change Analysis:** The commit adds `-ENETDOWN` to the list of network-related errors that should be treated as connection errors in the `ff_layout_io_track_ds_error()` function. This is a simple addition to an existing error handling switch statement. **Security Implications:** 1. **No vulnerability fix**: This change doesn't fix a security vulnerability. It improves error handling robustness by adding proper handling for the ENETDOWN (Network is down) error condition. 2. **Error handling improvement**: The change ensures that when a client receives an ENETDOWN error while trying to connect to a data server, it properly maps this to NFS4ERR_NXIO and marks the data server as unreachable, allowing failover to the metadata server through another network interface. 3. **No impact on security boundaries**: The change doesn't affect authentication, authorization, memory safety, or any other security-critical functionality. It's purely about network error handling and failover logic. 4. **Similar to existing patterns**: The commit follows the exact same pattern as other network errors already handled in the code (EHOSTDOWN, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, etc.). **Comparison with Similar Commits:** Like the provided reference commits that received "CVE Status: NO", this is a robustness improvement rather than a security fix. It's similar to the other NFS-related commits that improve error handling without addressing security vulnerabilities. **Conclusion:** This is a straightforward enhancement to network error handling in the NFS flexfile layout driver, ensuring proper failover behavior when network interfaces go down. It does not fix any security vulnerability and therefore does not warrant a CVE assignment.
a815975cbaeb4 i2c: qcom-geni: Update i2c frequency table to match hardware guidance
- [sasha] **Analysis Summary** **CVE Status: NO** **Rationale:** 1. **Nature of the Change**: This commit adjusts I2C clock timing parameters in frequency tables to match hardware programming guidance. The changes are: - For 100KHz: changed `t_low_cnt` from 11 to 12 - For 400KHz: changed `t_high_cnt` from 12 to 11, `t_cycle_cnt` from 24 to 22 - For 1MHz: changed `t_high_cnt` from 9 to 8, `t_low_cnt` from 3 to 2 2. **Purpose**: The commit explicitly states it's to fix a performance issue where I2C buses were achieving ~370KHz instead of the expected 400KHz, and to align with Qualcomm's internal programming guide. 3. **No Security Context**: - The commit message contains no security-related language - No mention of fixing vulnerabilities, access control issues, or security flaws - No CVE references or security implications discussed - The change is purely about performance/compliance optimization 4. **Type of Fix**: This is a hardware compliance/performance optimization, not a security fix. I2C timing adjustments for proper frequency operation do not typically introduce or fix security vulnerabilities. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked as "CVE Status: NO") involve driver improvements, resource management fixes, and hardware support enhancements - none were security-related. 6. **Impact Assessment**: Correcting I2C frequency timing to match hardware specifications improves communication reliability but does not address any security vulnerability. The changes affect clock cycle timing parameters that control signal timing, not access control, input validation, or other security-critical functions. This commit represents a standard hardware driver optimization to ensure proper I2C bus frequencies according to manufacturer specifications, with no security implications warranting CVE assignment.
f82d27dcff939 drm/amdkfd: set precise mem ops caps to disabled for gfx 11 and 12
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Nature of the change:** The commit removes capability flag `HSA_CAP_TRAP_DEBUG_PRECISE_MEMORY_OPERATIONS_SUPPORTED` for GFX 11 and 12 GPUs by deleting lines that would have enabled this debugging feature. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Stability fix, not security fix**: The commit message explicitly states "Clause instructions with precise memory enabled currently hang the shader so set capabilities flag to disabled since it's unsafe to use for debugging." This indicates a **hardware stability issue** causing shader hangs, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Debug-only functionality**: Based on my analysis of the kernel tree, this capability only affects debugging scenarios when: - Debug traps are explicitly enabled - A debugger specifically requests precise memory operations via `KFD_DBG_TRAP_FLAG_SINGLE_MEM_OP` - The process has proper debug permissions (PTRACE) 3. **Hardware limitation**: This is addressing a hardware-specific bug in GFX 11/12 where enabling precise memory operation debugging causes shader execution to hang. The fix prevents debuggers from enabling a broken feature. 4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The feature being disabled doesn't provide unauthorized access to memory or bypass security controls - it's purely a debugging aid that makes memory operations execute individually rather than batched. 5. **Consistent with similar commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided, capability adjustments and debugging feature changes are typically marked as "CVE Status: NO" when they address stability rather than security. The change is preventative - it disables a debugging feature that causes system instability on newer GPU generations, making this a **reliability/stability fix** rather than a security vulnerability.
017fbb6690c22 drm/amdgpu/discovery: check ip_discovery fw file available
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader context from examining the kernel tree, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: **What the commit does:** 1. **Code refactoring**: The main change is extracting firmware name selection logic into a new helper function `amdgpu_discovery_get_fw_name()` 2. **Removes hardcoded string**: Eliminates the hardcoded `FIRMWARE_IP_DISCOVERY` constant in favor of the new helper function 3. **Improves code organization**: Consolidates firmware file name mapping for different ASIC types **Security Analysis:** 1. **No new vulnerabilities introduced**: The commit maintains all existing security checks including signature verification and checksum validation 2. **No privilege changes**: The firmware loading mechanism remains the same - using the kernel's `request_firmware()` API 3. **No input validation changes**: The firmware file names are still predefined and controlled 4. **No memory safety issues**: The code continues to use proper memory allocation and cleanup **Comparison with similar commits:** Like the provided examples (commits fixing IP version checks), this is a **code quality/maintenance improvement** rather than a security fix. The similar commits that received "CVE Status: NO" also involved: - Helper function usage improvements - Code organization changes - API consistency fixes **Key security considerations:** - The commit preserves existing firmware validation mechanisms (signature + checksum verification) - Uses controlled, predefined firmware file names - no arbitrary file loading - Maintains proper error handling and fallback mechanisms - Does not modify any access controls or privilege boundaries This is a routine driver maintenance commit that improves code organization without introducing security vulnerabilities or fixing existing ones.
9e141923cf86b PCI: xilinx-cpm: Add cpm_csr register mapping for CPM5_HOST1 variant
- [sasha] **NO** Looking at this commit, it adds support for the CPM5_HOST1 variant to use the proper "cpm_csr" register mapping, extending an existing condition that was already implemented for CPM5. While the analysis shows this is functionally important for proper PCIe controller operation, this appears to be **adding support for a hardware variant** rather than fixing a security vulnerability: 1. **Feature Addition vs Bug Fix**: The commit extends existing functionality to include CPM5_HOST1, which suggests this is enabling a new hardware variant rather than fixing broken existing functionality. 2. **No Security Vulnerability Language**: The commit message describes this as adding support, not fixing a security issue. It states "ensuring proper resource mapping for this variant" rather than indicating existing systems were vulnerable. 3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: All the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" are similar hardware support additions or minor fixes without security implications. This commit follows the same pattern. 4. **Limited Impact Scope**: The issue only affects the specific CPM5_HOST1 hardware variant, and would likely result in functional failure rather than exploitable security vulnerability. The register mapping is critical for proper operation, but without evidence that CPM5_HOST1 systems were previously deployed and vulnerable, this appears to be a hardware enablement commit rather than a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
f3e1dccba0a08 PCI: dwc: ep: Ensure proper iteration over outbound map windows
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze this systematically: **CVE Analysis:** **NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a logic bug but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the bug**: The original code used a simple loop `for (index = 0; index < pci->num_ob_windows; index++)` to iterate through ALL possible outbound ATU windows, including unallocated ones. The bug was that it could incorrectly match against windows with `ep->outbound_addr[index] == 0` when the target address was also 0. 2. **The fix**: The commit replaces this with `for_each_set_bit(index, ep->ob_window_map, pci->num_ob_windows)` which only iterates through windows that are actually allocated (have their bit set in the bitmap). 3. **Impact assessment**: - This is a correctness fix, not a security fix - The function `dw_pcie_find_index` is used in `dw_pcie_ep_unmap_addr` to find the correct ATU window to unmap - A mismatch could lead to unmapping the wrong window or failing to find the correct window - However, this would result in functional issues (incorrect behavior) rather than security vulnerabilities 4. **No security implications**: - There's no memory corruption, buffer overflow, or privilege escalation risk - No access control bypass or information disclosure - The worst-case scenario is operational malfunction, not security compromise - The commit message focuses on correctness and proper hardware behavior, not security 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All 5 reference commits were marked as "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar correctness/functionality fixes in PCIe drivers without security implications. This is a hardware driver correctness fix that ensures proper window mapping functionality but does not present security risks.
bd22e44ad415a drm/amdgpu: rework how isolation is enforced v2
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the surrounding context, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis This commit is a **architectural improvement** that enhances an existing security mechanism (GPU process isolation) rather than fixing a security vulnerability. Here are the key reasons: ### 1. **Not a Vulnerability Fix** - The commit message clearly states this is about **"reworking how isolation is enforced"** to solve **functionality issues**, not security issues - It addresses problems with "gang submit and applying certain HW workarounds which require multiple VMIDs to work correctly" - This is an implementation improvement, not a vulnerability remediation ### 2. **No Security Bug Being Fixed** - The existing VMID-based isolation mechanism was **already working for security purposes** - The issue was that it **caused functional problems** with gang submissions and hardware workarounds - The commit **improves the implementation** while maintaining the same security guarantees ### 3. **No Exploitable Condition** - There's no evidence of any exploitable security weakness in the previous implementation - The old VMID reservation approach successfully prevented cross-process GPU memory leakage - The new DMA fence tracking approach provides equivalent security with better functionality ### 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits** Looking at the provided similar commits, all have **CVE Status: NO**, and they show similar patterns: - Infrastructure improvements to existing security mechanisms - Fixing functional issues with isolation features - Memory leak fixes in driver code - Updates to maintain isolation state ### 5. **Implementation Details Confirm This** The code changes show: - **Enhancement of tracking mechanism**: Moving from VMID limits to DMA fence tracking - **Better isolation granularity**: Per-partition isolation structures - **Improved synchronization**: More sophisticated fence management - **Functional robustness**: Better handling of gang submissions ### 6. **No Security Impact** - No weakening of security boundaries - No introduction of new attack vectors - No removal of existing protections - Same security goal (GPU process isolation) achieved with better implementation ## Conclusion This commit represents **security infrastructure improvement**, not **vulnerability remediation**. It maintains the same security guarantees while solving functional compatibility issues. The AMD GPU isolation mechanism continues to protect against cross-process GPU memory leakage attacks, just with a more robust implementation approach.
d7b0befd09320 ext4: on a remount, only log the ro or r/w state when it has changed
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this ext4 commit, I can now provide a definitive assessment. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Pure logging cosmetic change**: The modification only affects the format of an informational kernel message (`ext4_msg` with `KERN_INFO` level). It changes when the "ro" or "r/w" state is displayed in logs, but doesn't alter any security-relevant functionality. 2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit addresses user confusion about log messages, not any security flaw. The underlying ext4 remount logic, permission checks, and security controls remain completely unchanged. 3. **No functional impact**: The code change only affects message formatting: - Old: Always shows "ro" or "r/w" status - New: Only shows status when it actually changed - The actual filesystem state transitions and security implications are preserved 4. **Information improvement, not security fix**: This reduces potentially misleading log noise that could confuse users about whether a state change occurred. It's an improvement to user experience, not a security patch. 5. **Consistent with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits that are cosmetic/logging improvements are correctly marked "CVE Status: NO", and this follows the same pattern. The commit addresses bugzilla report #219132 about confusing log messages, which is clearly a usability issue rather than a security vulnerability. CVEs should only be assigned to changes that fix actual security vulnerabilities, not cosmetic improvements to logging behavior.
e1a9dda74dbff objtool: Properly disable uaccess validation
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the commit. Let me analyze it: ## Analysis Based on my examination of the commit message and code changes, this is **NOT** a security vulnerability that requires a CVE assignment. **CVE Status: NO** ## Reasoning: 1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit fixes a bug in objtool's validation logic, not a security vulnerability in the kernel itself. Objtool is a build-time static analysis tool that validates kernel code during compilation. 2. **What the issue was**: When `opts.uaccess` is disabled, objtool was supposed to completely skip uaccess validation. However, the code had an inconsistency where: - The `add_uaccess_safe()` function correctly checked `opts.uaccess` before populating the uaccess_safe_builtin list - But the validation logic in `handle_insn_ops()`, `INSN_STAC`/`INSN_CLAC` cases, and `validate_symbol()` was still running even when uaccess validation was disabled 3. **What the fix does**: The commit adds proper `!opts.uaccess` checks to completely disable uaccess validation when the option is turned off, preventing false warnings during build. 4. **Impact assessment**: - This is a **build-time tool issue**, not a runtime kernel security issue - The bug would only cause false positive warnings during kernel compilation - It does not affect the security, functionality, or behavior of the compiled kernel - No user data, system security, or kernel integrity is at risk 5. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the provided reference commits, they are all objtool-related changes that were marked "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern - it's a tool improvement, not a security fix. The fix ensures objtool behaves consistently when uaccess validation is disabled, eliminating false warnings but not addressing any security vulnerability in the kernel code itself.
cac48eb6d383e net/mlx5e: Use right API to free bitmap memory
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this from a security perspective: **CVE Analysis:** **NO** This commit fixes a memory management API mismatch but does not constitute a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the bug**: This is an API usage error where `kvfree()` was used instead of `bitmap_free()` to free memory allocated by `bitmap_zalloc_node()`. While incorrect, this doesn't create exploitable security conditions. 2. **Impact assessment**: The error manifests as a memtrack inconsistency error reported by the memory tracking system, indicating the wrong free function was called. This is a debugging/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. 3. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflows or underflows - No memory corruption that could be exploited - No privilege escalation potential - No information disclosure - No denial of service beyond normal driver malfunction 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All 5 reference commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar driver correctness fixes (missing configurations, memory leaks, API usage corrections) that don't constitute security vulnerabilities. 5. **Pattern recognition**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 5, which involved memory allocation/deallocation API corrections in the same mlx5 driver and was not assigned a CVE. The commit fixes a driver correctness issue to ensure proper memory management, but the API mismatch does not create exploitable security conditions that would justify CVE assignment.
16590745b571c drm/amdgpu: use GFP_NOWAIT for memory allocations
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my security assessment: **CVE STATUS: NO** ## Analysis Summary This commit changes memory allocation flags from `GFP_KERNEL` to `GFP_NOWAIT` in several AMD GPU driver paths, specifically in the `amdgpu_sync_fence` function and related VMID allocation code. ## Why This Should NOT Receive a CVE ### 1. **Performance Fix, Not Security Vulnerability** The commit message clearly states this addresses a **performance issue** in "critical submission path memory allocations" where blocking for memory reclaim "can potentially wait for submissions to finish." This describes a classic **deadlock prevention** scenario, not a security vulnerability. ### 2. **Proper Error Handling** All the changed call sites properly handle allocation failures: - Return `-ENOMEM` on allocation failure - Callers check return values and handle errors appropriately - No evidence of crash conditions or memory corruption on failure ### 3. **Limited Scope of GFP_NOWAIT Usage** The changes are primarily in: - **VMID allocation paths** (`amdgpu_ids.c`) - critical for GPU scheduling - **VM synchronization** - happens while holding locks - These are **legitimate use cases** for non-blocking allocation ### 4. **Consistent with Driver Patterns** Examining the broader codebase shows this follows existing patterns: - Other critical paths already use `GFP_NOWAIT` (coredump, etc.) - Similar to patterns in other GPU drivers (Intel i915, etc.) - Standard practice for atomic contexts and lock-held code paths ### 5. **No New Attack Surface** This change: - Does **not** introduce new user-triggerable paths - Does **not** create memory corruption opportunities - Does **not** bypass existing security controls - Reduces blocking behavior that could cause DoS through deadlocks ### 6. **Comparison with CVE-Worthy Examples** The provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show that routine memory management improvements in GPU drivers typically do not warrant CVEs unless they: - Fix actual memory corruption - Address privilege escalation - Patch information disclosure - Resolve use-after-free or similar memory safety issues **NO** - This is a performance optimization that prevents potential deadlocks in GPU command submission paths by using non-blocking memory allocation. While it increases allocation failure probability under memory pressure, it includes proper error handling and does not introduce security vulnerabilities, memory corruption, or new attack vectors.
61c39d8c83e20 lockdep: Fix wait context check on softirq for PREEMPT_RT
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a pure debugging/lockdep fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit explicitly addresses a false positive in lockdep's wait context checking for PREEMPT_RT kernels. 2. **No Security Impact**: - The issue is in lockdep's **testing framework** (`lib/locking-selftest.c:2618`), specifically in the "wait context tests" that verify mutex usage constraints in different contexts - The fix adds lockdep annotations (`lock_map_acquire_read(&bh_lock_map)` and `lock_map_release(&bh_lock_map)`) to properly track BH-disabled sections - These are **debugging annotations only** - they don't change actual locking behavior or security boundaries 3. **PREEMPT_RT Context**: On PREEMPT_RT kernels, softirqs are threaded and preemptible, which broke the wait context test assumptions. The fix properly tracks this state for lockdep validation without changing the underlying security model. 4. **Comparison to CVE Examples**: Looking at similar commit #5 which **was** assigned a CVE, that involved an actual race condition with RCU critical sections and real potential for deadlock. This commit only fixes lockdep false positives. 5. **Code Analysis**: The changes in `kernel/softirq.c:163,218,281` only add lockdep map operations that are conditionally compiled (`#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC`) and have no runtime security impact on production systems. This is a debugging infrastructure fix to prevent false lockdep warnings, not a security vulnerability.
3a17f23f7c36b dql: Fix dql->limit value when reset.
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific impact of this bug: **Analysis:** This commit fixes a bug in the Dynamic Queue Limits (DQL) implementation where `dql_reset()` was incorrectly setting `dql->limit = 0` instead of `dql->limit = dql->min_limit`. **Key findings:** 1. **The Bug**: When `dql_reset()` is called (which happens during network interface down/up operations via `netdev_tx_reset_queue()`), it was setting `dql->limit = 0` even when `dql->min_limit` had a non-zero value set by the user through sysfs (`/sys/class/net/eth*/queues/tx-0/byte_queue_limits/limit_min`). 2. **The Fix**: The change is simple - line 193 changes from `dql->limit = 0;` to `dql->limit = dql->min_limit;` to ensure the limit respects the minimum bound. 3. **Impact Assessment**: - This is a **functional correctness bug**, not a security vulnerability - It violates the expected invariant that `limit >= min_limit` - However, the `dql_completed()` function already enforces bounds checking with `limit = clamp(limit, dql->min_limit, dql->max_limit)` (line 173) - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation potential - No access control bypasses or input validation failures 4. **Security Implications**: - DQL is a network performance optimization mechanism for managing queue depths - The bug could cause temporary performance degradation but doesn't create security vulnerabilities - The bounds are properly enforced elsewhere in the code - No potential for exploitation or system compromise **Comparison with reference commits:** - Similar to "Similar Commit 1" (BUG() to WARN() conversion) - this is a correctness/robustness fix, not security - Similar to "Similar Commit 2&3" (queue limits fixes) - functional fixes without security implications - Unlike "Similar Commit 4" (NULL deref fix) - that had clear security implications with potential for exploitation **NO** This commit fixes a functional correctness bug in DQL where `dql_reset()` violated the invariant that `limit >= min_limit`. However, this is not a security vulnerability. The bug only causes temporary violation of user-configured constraints during interface reset operations, and proper bounds checking exists elsewhere in the code (`dql_completed()` function). There are no memory safety issues, access control bypasses, or potential for exploitation.
2738fb3ec6838 thermal/drivers/mediatek/lvts: Start sensor interrupts disabled
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the code, this is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Commit Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit modifies the initialization of the LVTS_MONINT register from a hardcoded value (`LVTS_MONINT_CONF` which was `0x0300318C`) to `0`, effectively starting with all sensor interrupts disabled. 2. **Security implications**: This is a configuration optimization, not a security fix. The change: - Removes the `LVTS_MONINT_CONF` constant definition - Changes `writel(LVTS_MONINT_CONF, LVTS_MONINT(lvts_ctrl->base))` to `writel(0, LVTS_MONINT(lvts_ctrl->base))` 3. **Functional behavior**: The commit message clearly states this is about proper initialization - interrupts are enabled per sensor as needed via `lvts_update_irq_mask()`. The function at lines 330-370 shows this selective enabling mechanism is already in place. 4. **No vulnerability patterns**: This change does not exhibit any of the security vulnerability patterns such as: - Buffer overflow fixes - Memory leak fixes - Access control issues - Input validation problems - Race condition fixes - Privilege escalation issues 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this aligns more with the "NO CVE" commits (1, 2, 3, 5) which are configuration/optimization changes rather than the "YES CVE" commit (4) which was a NULL pointer dereference fix. This is a code quality improvement that ensures cleaner initialization by starting with interrupts disabled and enabling them selectively, rather than starting with some interrupts enabled and then managing them. It's a defensive programming practice, not a security vulnerability fix.
229f3feb4b044 thermal/drivers/qoriq: Power down TMU on system suspend
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Power Management Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: This commit adds power management functionality to save approximately 4.3mW during system suspend. The commit message clearly states this is for power savings, not security. 2. **No Security Vulnerability Being Fixed**: The changes do not address any security issues such as: - Buffer overflows - Memory leaks - Access control bypasses - Input validation issues - Race conditions - Privilege escalation 3. **Simple Hardware Power Control**: The code changes are straightforward power management operations: - Setting TMR_CMD bit (bit 29) during suspend to power down the TMU - Clearing TMR_CMD bit during resume to power up the TMU - Only affects TMU version 2 and later hardware 4. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits provided, this follows the same pattern as other thermal subsystem commits that are marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are feature enhancements, hardware support additions, or bug fixes without security implications. 5. **No Sensitive Components Affected**: While thermal management is important for system stability, this specific change only affects power consumption during suspend/resume cycles and doesn't modify any security-critical behavior. The commit is a legitimate hardware power management improvement that reduces power consumption during system suspend, similar to many other power management features in the kernel.
14d17c78a4b16 Bluetooth: Disable SCO support if READ_VOICE_SETTING is unsupported/broken
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **CVE Status: YES** **Reasoning:** 1. **Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states "A SCO connection without the proper voice_setting can cause the controller to lock up." This describes a denial-of-service vulnerability where the Bluetooth controller can become unresponsive. 2. **Code Analysis**: The fix disables SCO support entirely when `read_voice_setting_capable(hdev)` returns false by setting `hdev->sco_pkts = 0`. This indicates that: - The inability to read voice settings creates a dangerous condition - Setting sco_pkts to 0 effectively prevents SCO connections from being established - This is a defensive measure to prevent controller lockups 3. **Attack Vector**: From the code in `hci_conn.c`, I can see that `conn->setting` (voice_setting) is used directly in SCO connection setup (`cp.voice_setting = cpu_to_le16(conn->setting)`). If this value is not properly initialized due to inability to read voice settings, it could contain invalid data that locks up the controller. 4. **Similar Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits, this follows the pattern of commit #3 (which was marked NO) that also deals with `HCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_READ_VOICE_SETTING`, but this commit addresses a more severe consequence - controller lockup rather than just command failures. 5. **Availability Impact**: Controller lockup represents a clear denial-of-service vulnerability that could affect system availability and require hardware reset to recover. The commit addresses a security vulnerability where malformed or uninitialized voice settings could cause hardware-level denial of service by locking up the Bluetooth controller, warranting CVE assignment.
25b6a6d29d408 net: tn40xx: create swnode for mdio and aqr105 phy and add to mdiobus
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the core security aspects of this commit: ## Security Analysis Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, this is **NOT** a security vulnerability fix. Here's why: **CVE Status: NO** ### Analysis: 1. **Purpose**: This commit is adding **new functionality** rather than fixing an existing security issue. It creates software nodes for MDIO and AQR105 PHY to enable firmware loading for specific Tehuti network cards. 2. **Code Pattern**: The changes involve: - Adding new data structures (`tn40_nodes`) to manage software nodes - Creating new functions (`tn40_swnodes_register`, `tn40_swnodes_cleanup`) - Adding firmware name definition (`AQR105_FIRMWARE`) - Modifying initialization/cleanup paths to handle the new functionality 3. **No Security Implications**: - No buffer overflow fixes - No memory leak fixes - No access control changes - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation fixes 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked "CVE Status: NO") are also MDIO/PHY-related feature additions or device tree handling improvements, which aligns with this commit's nature. 5. **Error Handling**: The code includes proper error handling with cleanup paths (`err_swnodes_cleanup`, `err_swnodes_unregister`), but this is normal defensive programming, not security hardening. 6. **Firmware Loading**: While the commit enables firmware loading (`AQR105_FIRMWARE`), this is standard functionality for PHY initialization and doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities. The commit is purely a feature enhancement to support AQR105-based network cards by providing the necessary device tree nodes for PHY firmware loading. There are no security vulnerabilities being addressed.
b48688ea3c9ac r8169: disable RTL8126 ZRX-DC timeout
- [sasha] 6ac4233afb9a3 Bluetooth: btmtksdio: Prevent enabling interrupts after IRQ handler removal
- [sasha] Perfect! This is very helpful context. Now let me examine if the current commit could lead to any security issues or system stability problems. Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from the Linux kernel tree, here is my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit fixes a **race condition** issue but does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit prevents re-enabling interrupts after the IRQ handler has been removed. The change adds a simple null check (`if (bdev->func->irq_handler)`) before calling `sdio_writel(bdev->func, C_INT_EN_SET, MTK_REG_CHLPCR, NULL)` in the `btmtksdio_txrx_work` function. 2. **Impact Assessment**: - The issue could cause **unexpected IRQ handler execution** due to stale interrupts - This is a **stability/reliability issue** rather than a security vulnerability - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure is involved - The worst-case scenario would be system instability or driver malfunction, not security compromise 3. **Code Analysis**: - The fix is preventive - it simply avoids enabling interrupts when the handler is no longer valid - This is similar to defensive programming to prevent use-after-free-like scenarios with interrupt handlers - The change is minimal and low-risk 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: - This is very similar to **Similar Commit 1** which was marked **CVE Status: YES** for a kernel oops fix in the same driver - However, that commit fixed an actual kernel oops (crash) caused by accessing uninitialized pointers - The current commit is more preventive - it avoids potential issues rather than fixing an active crash scenario 5. **Context from Historical Fix**: - A previous commit (`b062a0b9c1dc`) fixed a kernel oops in the same driver's interrupt handler - That was a more severe issue involving actual crashes due to uninitialized data access - The current fix is a more subtle race condition prevention **Conclusion**: While this commit addresses a legitimate bug (race condition in interrupt handling), it does not meet the criteria for CVE assignment as it's primarily a stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. The impact is limited to system reliability rather than security compromise.
9324571e9eea2 RISC-V: add vector extension validation checks
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this RISC-V kernel commit, here is my security assessment: **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary This commit **improves security posture** rather than fixing a vulnerability. It introduces proactive validation checks for RISC-V vector extensions that: 1. **Validates kernel configuration consistency**: Ensures vector extensions are only enabled when `CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V` is enabled 2. **Enforces dependency requirements**: Ensures vector floating-point extensions only activate when both FPU support and the D extension are available 3. **Prevents unsafe configurations**: The validation functions return `-EINVAL` to completely disable extensions that would be unsafe or unsupported ## Key Security-Relevant Changes ### Validation Functions Added: - `riscv_ext_vector_x_validate()`: Checks `CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V` is enabled (line 149-156) - `riscv_ext_vector_float_validate()`: Checks both `CONFIG_RISCV_ISA_V` and `CONFIG_FPU` are enabled, plus validates D extension availability (line 158-179) ### Proactive vs Reactive Security: The commit message states: *"Since vector will now be disabled proactively, there's no need to clear the bit in elf_hwcap in riscv_fill_hwcap() any longer."* This shows the change moves from **reactive** clearing of capabilities after detection to **proactive** validation during extension resolution. ## Why This Is Not CVE-Worthy 1. **Hardening, not vulnerability fixing**: This adds validation checks that prevent potentially unsafe configurations rather than fixing an existing exploitable vulnerability 2. **Defense-in-depth**: The validation framework ensures extensions are only enabled when properly supported by the kernel 3. **No direct security impact**: The changes affect configuration validation, not memory safety, access control, or other typical vulnerability categories 4. **Consistent with similar commits**: All provided examples (Similar Commits 1-5) are marked "CVE Status: NO" and represent similar correctness/configuration improvements This commit represents good security engineering practice by adding validation to prevent misconfigurations, but it does not fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited to cause harm.
bf9be373b830a SUNRPC: rpc_clnt_set_transport() must not change the autobind setting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** This commit fixes a logic bug where `rpc_clnt_set_transport()` was incorrectly modifying the `cl_autobind` setting based on the transport's bound state, when this setting should have been determined during client creation in `rpc_create()`. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **Logic/Configuration Issue, Not Security**: The bug causes the autobind setting to be overridden when switching transports, but this doesn't create a security vulnerability. It's a configuration management issue. 2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The autobind setting controls whether the RPC client automatically binds to available ports, but doesn't affect security boundaries or access controls. 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The change only removes a conditional assignment (`if (!xprt_bound(xprt)) clnt->cl_autobind = 1;`) - there are no buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues. 4. **Administrative Function**: `rpc_switch_client_transport()` is used for legitimate administrative operations like switching to mirrored NFS servers, not something an attacker could easily exploit. 5. **Functional Correctness**: This fix ensures that the autobind behavior remains consistent with what was originally intended when the client was created, rather than being inadvertently changed during transport switching. The change removes three lines that incorrectly modified `cl_autobind` based on transport state, ensuring the setting preserves its original value as determined during `rpc_create()`. This is a correctness fix rather than a security fix.
70facbf978ac9 mctp: Fix incorrect tx flow invalidation condition in mctp-i2c
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the issue. Based on the documentation at line 2286: "Returns negative errno, else the number of messages executed." This means: - `__i2c_transfer` returns **negative values** for errors - `__i2c_transfer` returns **positive values** (number of messages executed) for success - In this case, since `num = 1` (one message), a successful transfer would return `1` Now I can analyze the security implications: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a logic error in the flow invalidation condition but does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **The Bug**: The original code used `if (rc)` which would trigger flow invalidation on both errors (`rc < 0`) AND successful transfers (`rc > 0`, specifically `rc = 1` when 1 message is successfully transmitted). 2. **The Fix**: The code now correctly uses `if (rc < 0)` to only invalidate flows on actual I2C transfer errors. 3. **Impact Analysis**: - **Before fix**: Flow would be incorrectly invalidated even on successful transmissions, leading to premature flow cleanup and potential performance/functionality issues - **After fix**: Flow is only invalidated on actual errors, allowing proper flow management 4. **Security Relevance**: This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability: - No memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No privilege escalation potential - No access control bypass - No information disclosure - No denial of service through resource exhaustion - The flow invalidation mechanism itself is working correctly, it was just being triggered at the wrong time 5. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs (like the NULL pointer dereference fixes in `mctp_i2c_header_create`) addressed actual security vulnerabilities where missing validation could lead to kernel crashes or undefined behavior. This commit only fixes incorrect logic flow. This is a bug fix that improves reliability and correctness but does not address a security vulnerability that could be exploited maliciously.
7a874e8b54ea2 spi-rockchip: Fix register out of bounds access
- [sasha] Perfect! I can see there's another occurrence in the code where there's already a check `spi_get_chipselect(spi, 0) <= 1`. This indicates that the SOI field is only meant for native chip selects (0 and 1), not for GPIO chip selects. Now let me confirm what the fix does: The original code: ```c if (spi->mode & SPI_CS_HIGH) cr0 |= BIT(spi_get_chipselect(spi, 0)) << CR0_SOI_OFFSET; ``` The fixed code: ```c if ((spi->mode & SPI_CS_HIGH) && !(spi_get_csgpiod(spi, 0))) cr0 |= BIT(spi_get_chipselect(spi, 0)) << CR0_SOI_OFFSET; ``` The fix adds a check `!(spi_get_csgpiod(spi, 0))` which means "only do this if there's NO GPIO descriptor for chip select 0", i.e., only for native chip selects. **Analysis for CVE Assignment:** **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Security Vulnerability**: The original code had an out-of-bounds access vulnerability when using GPIO chip selects with high numbers. The `BIT(spi_get_chipselect(spi, 0))` operation could cause: - Out-of-bounds bit shifts when chip_select > 31 (undefined behavior) - Memory corruption when the shifted value is OR'd into the register field - Potential system instability or crash 2. **Similar Pattern to CVE-assigned commit**: This follows the exact same pattern as "Similar Commit 2" which was assigned a CVE. That commit also fixed out-of-bounds access with chip selects, specifically mentioning "out-of-bounds accesses to the statically-sized array" when GPIO chipselects had values higher than expected. 3. **Impact**: The vulnerability could be triggered by legitimate SPI device configurations using GPIO chip selects with high numbers, potentially leading to: - Kernel memory corruption - System crashes - Unpredictable hardware behavior 4. **Affected Component**: This affects the SPI subsystem, which is a core kernel component used for communicating with various hardware devices. The commit message explicitly states "Fix register out of bounds access" and explains that "GPIOs can be numbered much higher than native CS", directly confirming this is a bounds-checking security fix.
6c06be908ca19 cifs: Check if server supports reparse points before using them
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can provide an assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Nature of the Changes The commit adds **defensive programming checks** to prevent attempting reparse point operations when the server filesystem doesn't support them. Specifically, it adds checks for `FILE_SUPPORTS_REPARSE_POINTS` in the filesystem attributes before: 1. **fs/smb/client/cifssmb.c**: Querying reparse points (line 2732-2733) 2. **fs/smb/client/link.c**: Creating reparse-based symlinks (line 647) 3. **fs/smb/client/smb2inode.c**: Creating reparse inodes (lines 1281-1284) 4. **fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c**: Making reparse-based nodes (line 5244) ## Security Impact Assessment - **No vulnerability being fixed**: This commit prevents "creating unusable empty objects on the server" as stated in the commit message, but this is a **functionality/usability issue**, not a security vulnerability - **No memory corruption**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues are being addressed - **No privilege escalation**: No access control bypasses or privilege escalation paths are being fixed - **No information disclosure**: No sensitive data leakage issues are being resolved ## Similar Commits Analysis Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they involve: - Error handling improvements for reparse points - Optimizations for reparse point querying - Support for WSL reparse points - Validation of reparse point buffers This commit follows the same pattern - it's an improvement to robustness and error handling, not a security fix. ## Conclusion This is a **robustness improvement** that prevents unnecessary server operations when reparse points aren't supported, avoiding creation of "unusable empty objects." While it improves the code quality and prevents wasteful operations, it doesn't fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
b7fbcd77bb467 drm/amdgpu: rework how the cleaner shader is emitted v3
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of this commit and the surrounding code, I can now provide my CVE assessment: **NO** This commit does NOT warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my detailed analysis: ## Analysis Summary ### What the commit actually does: The commit is an **optimization** that changes when the GPU cleaner shader is emitted. Instead of emitting it for every job with `enforce_isolation=true`, it now only emits it for the first submission from each client (when `&job->base.s_fence->scheduled == isolation->spearhead`). ### Why this is NOT a security vulnerability: 1. **This is a performance optimization, not a security fix**: The commit message and code changes show this is about reducing unnecessary cleaner shader executions to improve performance, not fixing a security flaw. 2. **The NULL pointer fixes (v2/v3) are defensive programming**: The addition of `job->base.s_fence &&` in the condition is a defensive NULL check to prevent crashes, not a security vulnerability fix. This prevents kernel crashes but doesn't address an exploitable security flaw. 3. **The isolation mechanism still functions correctly**: The spearhead mechanism ensures that cleaner shaders run when ownership transitions between different clients occur, which is the critical security boundary. 4. **Similar commits in the reference set**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also deals with cleaner shader emission timing - classified as NO CVE - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Another cleaner shader optimization - classified as NO CVE - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Related to context switching isolation - classified as NO CVE 5. **No indication of prior exploitable vulnerability**: The commit doesn't mention fixing crashes, data leaks, or security issues. The "v3: fix another NULL pointer deref" refers to preventing kernel crashes during edge cases, not addressing an exploitable security flaw. ### Security considerations addressed: While the optimization does change the isolation behavior, it maintains the core security guarantee: cleaner shaders still run at ownership boundaries between different clients, which is what prevents data leakage. The change from "every isolated job" to "first job from each client" is a performance optimization that doesn't compromise the fundamental security model. The NULL pointer checks added are important for system stability but represent defensive programming rather than fixes for exploitable vulnerabilities.
53377b5c29520 net: tn40xx: add pci-id of the aqr105-based Tehuti TN4010 cards
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see that `PCI_DEVICE_ID_TEHUTI_TN9510` is defined as `0x4025` in line 12 of `/home/sasha/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40.h`. Now let me analyze this commit thoroughly: ## Analysis **CVE Status: NO** ## Detailed Analysis This commit is **NOT** a security fix and should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ### 1. **Nature of Changes** The commit only adds PCI device IDs to the `tn40_id_table[]` array: ```c + { PCI_DEVICE_SUB(PCI_VENDOR_ID_TEHUTI, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TEHUTI_TN9510, + PCI_VENDOR_ID_TEHUTI, 0x3015) }, + { PCI_DEVICE_SUB(PCI_VENDOR_ID_TEHUTI, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TEHUTI_TN9510, + PCI_VENDOR_ID_EDIMAX, 0x8102) }, ``` ### 2. **Commit Intent** The commit message clearly states this is to "add pci-id of the aqr105-based Tehuti TN4010 cards to allow loading of the tn40xx driver on these cards." This is purely adding hardware support, not fixing a vulnerability. ### 3. **Code Impact** - **No security-related functionality is changed** - **No access controls are modified** - **No memory management fixes** - **No input validation changes** - **No privilege escalation fixes** - **No buffer overflow fixes** ### 4. **Pattern Comparison with Similar Commits** This commit follows the exact same pattern as the historical examples provided, all of which have "CVE Status: NO": - Similar Commit 1: Adding Edimax Vendor ID - Similar Commit 2: Adding Microchip PCI100X device IDs - Similar Commit 3: Adding Intel WiFi PCI device ID - Similar Commit 4: Adding Telit modem PCI device ID - Similar Commit 5: Adding Arcadyan PCI device ID ### 5. **Security Assessment** Adding PCI device IDs to a driver's device table is a standard hardware enablement activity that: - Does not introduce new attack vectors - Does not fix existing vulnerabilities - Does not change any security boundaries - Simply allows the existing driver to bind to additional hardware variants The commit represents normal hardware support expansion, identical to numerous other PCI ID additions that are routine maintenance rather than security fixes.
eeb827f2922eb cifs: add validation check for the fields in smb_aces
- [sasha] Now let me understand the exact nature of the vulnerability by analyzing what the new validation checks prevent. Based on the commit diff, I can see the vulnerability: **Analysis of the Security Issue:** Looking at the code changes, the original code was missing critical validation when parsing SMB ACE (Access Control Entry) structures from network data. The vulnerability exists in the `parse_dacl()` function in `fs/smb/client/cifsacl.c`. **Before the patch:** - The code would blindly trust the `num_subauth` field from network data - It would access `ppace[i]->sid.sub_auth[2]` without validating bounds - No validation that the ACE size was consistent with the SID structure - No validation that the SID had a reasonable number of sub-authorities **After the patch, the following validations were added:** 1. **Buffer bounds check**: `if (end_of_acl - acl_base < acl_size)` 2. **SID sub-authority validation**: `ppace[i]->sid.num_subauth == 0` or `> SID_MAX_SUB_AUTHORITIES` 3. **SID size validation**: Ensures there's enough space for the sub-authorities array 4. **ACE size consistency**: Validates that the ACE's size field matches the actual SID size **Security Impact:** This appears to be a **buffer overflow/out-of-bounds read vulnerability**. An attacker could craft malicious SMB ACL data with: - Invalid `num_subauth` values pointing beyond buffer boundaries - Inconsistent size fields causing reads beyond allocated memory - This could lead to information disclosure or potentially memory corruption **CVE Decision:** YES **Explanation:** This commit fixes a clear security vulnerability - a buffer overflow/out-of-bounds read issue in SMB ACL parsing. The missing validation checks allowed untrusted network data to control array access patterns, potentially leading to reading beyond allocated memory boundaries. The code accesses `ppace[i]->sid.sub_auth[2]` (line 844 in the source) without validating that the SID has sufficient sub-authorities or that the buffer has enough space. This is a classic input validation vulnerability in network protocol parsing code that could be exploited by malicious SMB servers to cause information disclosure or memory corruption.
0af5fb5ed3d2f NFSv4: Treat ENETUNREACH errors as fatal for state recovery
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the code and the security implications, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. ## Reasoning: 1. **This is a reliability/robustness fix, not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit addresses an infinite loop condition in the NFSv4 state manager when encountering network unreachability errors (`ENETUNREACH`/`ENETDOWN`). While this could theoretically lead to resource consumption, it's not a security vulnerability in the traditional sense. 2. **No exploitable security boundary crossed**: The issue occurs in the kernel's NFS state recovery mechanism, but: - It requires legitimate NFS operations to trigger - The "attack" would be network-level (making the NFS server unreachable) - It doesn't lead to privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized access - The impact is limited to the affected NFS client hanging/consuming resources 3. **Comparing to similar historical commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar commits that got **CVE Status: NO** were also reliability/robustness fixes - The one that got **CVE Status: YES** involved actual memory corruption (crash with stack trace showing panic) - This commit is more similar to the reliability fixes that didn't get CVEs 4. **The fix is preventive rather than corrective of an active exploit**: The change prevents a potential DoS condition by gracefully failing instead of retrying indefinitely. However, this is more about system robustness than fixing an exploitable security flaw. 5. **Limited attack vector**: An attacker would need to: - Have an established NFS client connection - Be able to manipulate network connectivity (typically requires network-level access) - The impact would be localized to that specific NFS client While this commit does improve system resilience against resource exhaustion, it falls more into the category of a bug fix that improves reliability rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited to compromise system security.
be786e509c1af cifs: Set default Netbios RFC1001 server name to hostname in UNC
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the codebase, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability Present**: The code changes implement proper bounds checking and memory management: - The loop condition `i < RFC1001_NAME_LEN && hostname[i] != 0` ensures no buffer overflow beyond the 15-character RFC1001 name limit - The `extract_hostname()` function properly validates the UNC string and returns an error pointer if extraction fails - Memory is properly allocated and freed (`kfree(hostname)`) 2. **Proper Input Validation**: - The code checks if `extract_hostname()` returns an error using `IS_ERR(hostname)` - The function has error handling that goes to `cifs_parse_mount_err` on failure - The target buffer is properly initialized with `memset()` before use 3. **Consistent with Existing Code Patterns**: - The new code follows the same pattern as existing `source_rfc1001_name` handling in the same file - Uses the same bounds checking (`RFC1001_NAME_LEN`) and `toupper()` transformation - No new attack surface is introduced 4. **Functionality Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: - This is a feature enhancement to automatically set the RFC1001 server name from the UNC hostname - It doesn't fix any existing vulnerability or security issue - The commit message describes a compatibility improvement, not a security fix 5. **No Memory Safety Issues**: - All array accesses are bounds-checked - No uncontrolled user input processing - Proper error handling for allocation failures The code correctly handles the transformation of hostname data into the fixed-size RFC1001 name buffer with appropriate bounds checking and error handling.
ad9364a6835c4 cifs: Fix getting DACL-only xattr system.cifs_acl and system.smb3_acl
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and security implications: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **It's a functional improvement, not a vulnerability fix**: The commit corrects API behavior to match documentation by ensuring that different xattr interfaces (`system.cifs_acl`, `system.cifs_ntsd`, `system.cifs_ntsd_full`) request only the specific ACL components they're supposed to return. 2. **No exploitable security flaw**: The previous behavior where all ACL requests included OWNER, GROUP, and DACL information regardless of what was requested was inefficient and potentially exposed more information than necessary, but this doesn't constitute an exploitable vulnerability. 3. **Security enhancement, not vulnerability remediation**: The changes implement the principle of least privilege by ensuring that: - `system.cifs_acl` now correctly requests only DACL information (`DACL_SECINFO`) - `system.cifs_ntsd` requests OWNER + GROUP + DACL (`OWNER_SECINFO | GROUP_SECINFO | DACL_SECINFO`) - `system.cifs_ntsd_full` requests all components including SACL 4. **Matches pattern of similar non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this follows the same pattern as other CIFS fixes that improve functionality and security posture without addressing exploitable vulnerabilities. The key code changes in `fs/smb/client/xattr.c` show a switch from hardcoded behavior to proper mapping of xattr types to ACL components, which is an API correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability remediation.
d181acea5b864 mailbox: pcc: Use acpi_os_ioremap() instead of ioremap()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, along with the context from similar commits: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code improvement/hardening change, not a security fix. The commit message explicitly states it's about using the "preferred" mapping function (`acpi_os_ioremap()`) instead of the generic `ioremap()` for ACPI-defined memory regions. 2. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The change from `ioremap()` to `acpi_os_ioremap()` is about using the correct memory attributes for ACPI regions, not fixing a security vulnerability. Both functions perform memory mapping, but `acpi_os_ioremap()` is more appropriate for EFI/ACPI defined regions. 3. **Error handling improvement**: The addition of error checking (`if (!pcc_mbox_chan->shmem) return -ENXIO;`) is defensive programming to handle mapping failures, not fixing an exploitable condition. 4. **Similar pattern in provided examples**: All the similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" involve mailbox driver improvements without security implications - they fix race conditions, improve interrupt handling, or correct device usage patterns, but none involve actual security vulnerabilities. 5. **No security-sensitive operations affected**: The code doesn't show patterns typical of security fixes like buffer overflow protections, privilege escalation fixes, or access control changes. It's simply using a more appropriate mapping function for the memory region type. This is a quality improvement and hardening change, not a security vulnerability fix.
892c788d73fe4 fbcon: Use correct erase colour for clearing in fbcon
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment: **CVE STATUS: NO** **Explanation:** This commit fixes a color calculation bug in the framebuffer console, but it is **not** a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is in the erase color calculation for fbcon clearing operations. The old `attr_col_ec` function was missing depth-dependent remapping and didn't handle blanking correctly, causing incorrect color values to be used. 2. **Impact analysis**: The commit description mentions that at 2bpp (4 shades of gray), the wrong color value (7 instead of 1) was being passed to fillrect operations, which expect values 0-3. While this could cause "interesting" visual results, it's fundamentally a display corruption issue, not a security vulnerability. 3. **Security implications**: - No memory corruption: The bug affects color value calculation, not memory boundaries - No privilege escalation: This is purely a display rendering issue - No information disclosure: Incorrect colors don't leak sensitive data - No denial of service: The system continues to function normally 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also a display issue preventing memory access outside graphics region - more serious but still marked NO - Similar Commits 2&3 (YES CVE): NULL pointer dereference causing kernel panic - clear security impact - Similar Commit 5 (YES CVE): Use-after-free vulnerability - clear memory safety issue This commit fixes a display rendering bug that could cause visual artifacts but poses no security risk. The impact is limited to incorrect color display on certain framebuffer configurations, which is a quality/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
781802aa5a595 cifs: Fix establishing NetBIOS session for SMB2+ connection
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the current implementation is already using `smb_send_kvec()` (line 3211), not `smb_send()`. This suggests the fix has already been applied. But based on the commit message provided, this commit is supposed to be making this exact change. Let me analyze what the security implications would have been when `smb_send()` was used instead. Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: ## Analysis Summary 1. **Nature of the Bug**: This was a packet formatting issue, not a memory corruption or access control vulnerability. The problem was that `smb_send()` added an unwanted RFC1002 header to NetBIOS Session Request packets for SMB2+ connections, creating malformed packets. 2. **Root Cause**: The `smb_send()` function calls `__smb_send_rqst()`, which for SMB2+ protocols adds an RFC1002 header (lines 324-337 in transport.c). For NetBIOS Session Request packets, this creates a double-header structure that SMB2+ servers cannot parse. 3. **Primary Impact**: **Connection failure**, not security compromise. The malformed packets would be rejected by SMB2+ servers, preventing successful NetBIOS session establishment over port 139. 4. **Limited Security Implications**: - **No memory corruption**: The issue doesn't cause buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues - **No privilege escalation**: The bug doesn't allow bypassing authentication or access controls - **No information disclosure**: While the malformed packet contains an incorrect length field, this doesn't leak sensitive kernel data - **No remote code execution**: Servers would simply reject the malformed packets 5. **Comparison with CVE-marked commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES": - Commit 3: Fixed a use-after-free (UAF) issue with server pointer cleanup - Commit 4: Fixed a use-after-free in session teardown These involved actual memory safety issues that could lead to crashes, information disclosure, or potential code execution. The current commit only fixes packet formatting. 6. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability only affected NetBIOS over TCP (port 139) for SMB2+ connections - a rare configuration in modern environments where port 445 is standard. ## Conclusion While this was an important bug fix for protocol compliance and connectivity, it represents a **functional issue** rather than a **security vulnerability**. The fix prevents connection failures but doesn't close any attack vectors or prevent exploitation scenarios that would warrant CVE assignment.
76d3ca8998135 fbdev: core: tileblit: Implement missing margin clearing for tileblit
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Nature of the Fix The commit implements the missing `tile_clear_margins()` function, which was previously a no-op (just contained `return;`). This is a **functionality bug fix**, not a security vulnerability fix. ## Code Analysis The changes add proper margin clearing logic: - Calculates margin dimensions (`rw`, `bh`, `rs`, `bs`) - Fills margin areas using `info->tileops->fb_tilefill()` - Implements bounds checking (`if (rect.width + rect.sx > vwt)` and similar) ## Why This Is Not a Security Issue 1. **No Memory Safety Issue**: The "garbage at the bottom of the screen" mentioned in the commit message refers to uncleared display pixels, not memory corruption or out-of-bounds access. 2. **Display Quality, Not Security**: This fixes a visual artifact where old pixel data remains visible in screen margins, which is purely cosmetic. 3. **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: While the commit mentions "garbage," this refers to leftover framebuffer content, not sensitive kernel memory being exposed to userspace. 4. **Proper Bounds Checking**: The new code includes appropriate bounds validation to prevent writing outside virtual screen dimensions. 5. **Limited Attack Surface**: Framebuffer operations require console/root privileges, and this specific issue affects only tile-based display modes on legacy hardware. ## Comparison to Similar Commits Unlike the CVE-worthy examples (buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access), this commit fixes a display rendering issue without addressing any exploitable vulnerability.
196a062641fe6 tracing: Mark binary printing functions with __printf() attribute
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because: 1. **No vulnerability fix**: This commit only adds `__printf()` format attributes to function declarations. It does not fix any actual security vulnerability, buffer overflow, format string attack, or other security issue. 2. **Code quality improvement**: The changes are purely to satisfy compiler warnings (`-Werror=suggest-attribute=format`) and improve code quality by enabling better compile-time format string checking. 3. **No functional changes**: The commit explicitly states it's fixing "compilation errors" caused by missing format attributes. No actual code logic, memory handling, or security controls are modified. 4. **Format attribute purpose**: The `__printf()` attribute tells the compiler to check format strings at compile time, which is a *preventive* security measure but not a fix for an existing vulnerability. 5. **Similar patterns**: All the reference commits provided show similar characteristics - they deal with format string handling improvements, precision checks, and compiler attribute additions, and none were assigned CVEs. 6. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication that missing these attributes created any exploitable condition. The functions were already handling format strings correctly; they just weren't getting the benefit of compile-time format checking. The security value of this commit is in *preventing* future format string vulnerabilities through better compile-time checking, not in fixing an existing security flaw that could be exploited.
24fdd5074b205 mailbox: use error ret code of of_parse_phandle_with_args()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a comprehensive security assessment. **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Analysis ### 1. Nature of the Change This commit is a **code quality improvement** that preserves more specific error information rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The change: - Replaces a generic `-ENODEV` error with more specific error codes (`-EINVAL`, `-ENOENT`) - Improves error reporting precision for debugging and diagnostics - Does not fix any exploitable security condition ### 2. Comparison with Similar CVE-Assigned Commits Looking at the reference commits that received CVEs: **Similar Commit 1 & 2 (CVE Status: YES):** These fixed actual security bugs where incorrect error checking (`IS_ERR()` vs `NULL`) could lead to: - Kernel crashes from NULL pointer dereferences - Potential privilege escalation through memory corruption - System instability from improper resource handling **Similar Commit 5 (CVE Status: YES):** Added missing error pointer validation that could prevent system crashes. **Similar Commit 3 & 4 (CVE Status: NO):** Made structural fixes (data type corrections, error path improvements) without security implications. ### 3. Security Impact Assessment This commit has **no direct security impact**: - No memory corruption fixes - No access control changes - No privilege escalation prevention - No input validation improvements - No race condition fixes - No buffer overflow prevention ### 4. Code Analysis The change from `return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)` to `return ERR_PTR(ret)` in `/drivers/mailbox/mailbox.c:417` simply preserves the original error code returned by `of_parse_phandle_with_args()`. This provides: - Better debugging information (distinguishes between invalid parameters vs missing resources) - More precise error reporting to userspace - Improved code maintainability ### 5. Risk Assessment **No exploitable conditions** are created or fixed by this change: - Error codes are used for control flow and debugging only - No security boundaries are crossed - No sensitive data exposure or corruption prevention - No denial of service conditions addressed This is a **code improvement commit** that enhances error reporting precision without addressing any security vulnerability, and therefore does not warrant CVE assignment.
803f97298e7de iommufd: Extend IOMMU_GET_HW_INFO to report PASID capability
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit comprehensively: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Commit Analysis **What this commit does:** 1. **Feature Addition**: Extends the existing `IOMMU_GET_HW_INFO` ioctl to report PASID (Process Address Space ID) capabilities to userspace 2. **API Enhancement**: Adds new fields to the UAPI structure (`out_max_pasid_log2` and new capability flags) 3. **Information Reporting**: Provides a new PCI function `pci_pasid_status()` to check PASID status **Security Assessment:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is purely adding new functionality to report hardware capabilities, not fixing any existing security issue 2. **Information Disclosure Only**: The commit only exposes hardware capability information that userspace applications need to determine PASID support - this is not sensitive security information 3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The code changes involve: - Adding new fields to existing structures - Reading PCI configuration registers safely - Proper bounds checking with existing validation (`cmd->flags || cmd->__reserved[0]...`) 4. **No Access Control Changes**: The commit doesn't modify any access control mechanisms, permission checks, or authentication logic 5. **No Privilege Escalation**: The new functionality only provides read-only hardware capability information through an existing, controlled ioctl interface 6. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical references provided, similar feature additions (like "iommufd: Add missing IOMMUFD_DRIVER kconfig") were correctly marked as non-security issues The `WARN_ON_ONCE` check in the code (`ctrl < 0 || !(ctrl & PCI_PASID_CTRL_ENABLE)`) is a sanity check to ensure internal consistency but doesn't indicate a security issue - it's verifying that PASID is properly enabled when the kernel thinks it should be. This is a straightforward feature enhancement that improves the IOMMU userspace API by providing necessary hardware capability information for PASID usage.
bcba8d4dbe688 ring-buffer: Use kaslr address instead of text delta
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, I can now provide a security assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: ## Security Analysis 1. **Information Disclosure Protection**: The commit actually **improves** security by adding explicit protections against KASLR address leakage. The key security enhancement is in the `show_last_boot_header` function which includes a comment: "Do not leak KASLR address" and only shows KASLR information for previous boots, not current ones. 2. **Simplified Implementation**: The change simplifies the implementation by storing the KASLR offset directly instead of calculating text and data deltas. This reduces complexity and potential for errors. 3. **Access Control**: The KASLR address is only shown when `TRACE_ARRAY_FL_LAST_BOOT` flag is set, meaning it's from a previous boot. When the ring buffer is actively used, this flag gets cleared and only shows "# Current" instead of the actual address. 4. **No New Attack Surface**: The commit doesn't introduce new ways to access sensitive information. It actually restricts access by: - Only showing KASLR addresses from previous boots (not current) - Clearing the flag when tracing becomes active - Adding explicit comments about not leaking KASLR addresses 5. **Legitimate Functionality**: This is for persistent ring buffer tracing across reboots - a legitimate debugging feature that needs to account for KASLR differences between boots. ## Comparison with CVE-marked Commits Unlike Similar Commit 4 which had a **CVE Status: YES** due to a buffer overflow vulnerability that could corrupt memory, this commit: - Doesn't fix a vulnerability - Doesn't introduce new attack vectors - Actually adds security protections - Is a refactoring/improvement rather than a security fix The commit is a code improvement that enhances security by being more explicit about KASLR address protection, not a vulnerability fix.
86d16cd12efa5 fbdev: fsl-diu-fb: add missing device_remove_file()
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of this commit and the security implications, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The missing `device_remove_file()` call does not create a security vulnerability. When the device is removed, the kernel automatically cleans up all sysfs files through the device removal process (`device_del()` → `sysfs_remove_dir()`), so there are no resource leaks or dangling file handles. 2. **Automatic Cleanup**: The Linux kernel's device model provides automatic cleanup of sysfs attributes when a device is unregistered. The sysfs file created with `device_create_file()` will be implicitly removed when the device's sysfs directory is removed during device cleanup. 3. **No Impact on System Security**: This is purely a code hygiene issue. The missing call doesn't: - Create memory leaks - Allow unauthorized access to system resources - Create race conditions that could be exploited - Cause system instability 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - **Similar Commit 1 & 2**: Simple build fixes or code improvements (NO CVE) - **Similar Commit 4**: Missing cleanup in error path (NO CVE) - **Similar Commits 3 & 5**: These had CVEs because they involved UAF (use-after-free) issues where data structures were accessed after being freed 5. **Nature of the Fix**: This commit adds a symmetric cleanup call to match the `device_create_file()` call in the probe function. It's a best practice fix to maintain proper create/remove symmetry in driver code, not a security fix. The fix improves code maintainability and follows kernel coding best practices, but does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited.
9e8f324bd44c1 NFSv4: Check for delegation validity in nfs_start_delegation_return_locked()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and the change, here's what's happening: **CVE Status: NO** **Analysis:** This commit fixes a race condition in the NFS delegation code, but it's a **robustness/stability fix** rather than a **security vulnerability**. Here's why: 1. **The Race Condition**: The fix addresses a timing window where: - `nfs_start_delegation_return_locked()` obtains a delegation reference via RCU - Between the RCU dereference and acquiring the delegation->lock, another thread calls `nfs_detach_delegation_locked()` - `nfs_detach_delegation_locked()` sets `delegation->inode = NULL` at line 367 - The original thread then proceeds with a delegation that has a NULL inode pointer 2. **The Fix**: The commit adds a check `if (delegation->inode &&` before proceeding with the delegation return operation. This ensures the delegation is still properly attached to an inode before trying to return it. 3. **Impact Assessment**: - **Not a security issue**: This doesn't involve privilege escalation, memory corruption, or unauthorized access - **Stability issue**: Without the fix, the code might proceed with an invalid delegation, potentially leading to system instability or crashes - **Similar to reference commits**: All 5 similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar performance/stability optimizations in NFS delegation handling 4. **Context from similar commits**: The pattern shows these are all part of ongoing work to improve NFS delegation performance and avoid soft lockups, not security fixes. The commit prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference or invalid state, but this is a robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
6359691b4fbca tpm: Convert warn to dbg in tpm2_start_auth_session()
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the TPM session management code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary The commit changes a `dev_warn_once()` to `dev_dbg_once()` in the `tpm2_start_auth_session()` function when detecting that an authentication session is already active. This is purely a **log level adjustment** with no security implications. ## Key Findings 1. **No Functional Change**: The code behavior is identical - when `chip->auth` is already set, the function returns 0 (success) immediately, regardless of the log level used. 2. **Legitimate Condition**: The warning was being triggered during normal, expected operation. TPM2 sessions are designed to be reused efficiently through the `TPM2_SA_CONTINUE_SESSION` attribute, and multiple in-kernel callers expect this behavior. 3. **No Security Impact**: - No authentication bypass occurs - No privilege escalation is possible - Cryptographic session integrity remains intact - The underlying security mechanisms are unchanged 4. **Consistent with Design**: The TPM session management system explicitly supports session continuation and reuse as an optimization, making this a normal operational condition rather than an error state. ## Code Context The change occurs at the entry check of `tpm2_start_auth_session()`: ```c if (chip->auth) { - dev_warn_once(&chip->dev, "auth session is active\n"); + dev_dbg_once(&chip->dev, "auth session is active\n"); return 0; } ``` This early return path handles the legitimate case where a session is already established and can be reused, which is the intended behavior since commit df745e25098dc ("tpm: Lazily flush the auth session"). ## Conclusion This is a **code cleanup/maintenance change** that reduces unnecessary log noise during normal operation, not a security fix. The change from warning to debug appropriately reflects that session reuse is expected behavior rather than an error condition.
c73e680d1f840 exfat: call bh_read in get_block only when necessary
- [sasha] Let me examine the security implications by analyzing the code changes directly: **NO** This commit is a performance optimization that restructures the logic in `exfat_get_block()` to call `bh_read()` only when necessary, but it doesn't fix a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Performance optimization, not security fix**: The commit message clearly states this is about handling "partial unwritten blocks that could be mapped with other blocks more efficiently" rather than fixing a security issue. 2. **Code restructuring preserves security checks**: The commit reorganizes the existing logic but maintains all the critical security protections: - The `folio_buffers()` check and `-EAGAIN` fallback (lines 364-367) - The buffer data validation (lines 375-381) - The proper bounds checking for `bh_result->b_data != addr` 3. **No new vulnerabilities introduced**: The restructured code moves the `bh_read()` call into a more specific conditional path but doesn't change its fundamental behavior or remove safety checks. 4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: Unlike Similar Commits 2 and 3 which fixed actual stack corruption vulnerabilities (CVE Status: YES), this commit doesn't address any memory safety issues or race conditions. 5. **No security-sensitive changes**: The modifications focus on optimizing when `bh_read()` is called rather than fixing buffer overflows, UAF issues, or other security vulnerabilities. This is a legitimate performance improvement that reduces unnecessary I/O operations without compromising security.
8344213571b2a fuse: Return EPERM rather than ENOSYS from link()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the changes. Based on the provided diff, the key change is: 1. Before: If `create_new_entry()` returned `-ENOSYS`, the function would return `-ENOSYS` to userspace 2. After: The function now converts `-ENOSYS` to `-EPERM` before returning to userspace **Security Analysis:** **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. **Reasoning:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is purely a cosmetic error code change with no security implications. The change converts `ENOSYS` (function not implemented) to `EPERM` (operation not permitted) for the `link()` system call. 2. **Standards Compliance Fix**: According to the man page for `link()`, `EPERM` is the documented error code when "the filesystem containing oldpath and newpath does not support the creation of hard links." The original `ENOSYS` was technically incorrect according to POSIX standards. 3. **No Access Control Impact**: The change doesn't affect: - Authentication or authorization mechanisms - Memory safety - Buffer handling - Race conditions - Privilege escalation paths - Input validation 4. **Behavioral Consistency**: The existing logic already: - Sets the `no_link` flag when receiving `ENOSYS` - Returns `EPERM` for subsequent calls when `no_link` is set - This change simply makes the first call consistent with subsequent calls 5. **Reference to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" include cosmetic changes, function naming consistency fixes, and non-security-related corrections - this fits that pattern. This is a standards compliance fix that improves the correctness of error reporting without any security implications.
f06777cf2bbc2 ACPI: PNP: Add Intel OC Watchdog IDs to non-PNP device list
- [sasha] **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a device enumeration fix that adds Intel OC Watchdog ACPI IDs to the non-PNP device list to prevent driver binding conflicts. The change only adds static configuration data (`{"INT3F0D"}` and `{"INTC1099"}`) to ensure proper driver binding, with no security implications or vulnerability fixes involved.
9cc0bbdaba2a6 io_uring/msg: initialise msg request opcode
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this commit for CVE eligibility: ## Analysis Summary **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because it is a preventive hardening measure rather than a fix for an exploitable vulnerability. Here's my analysis: ### What the commit does: The commit adds `req->opcode = IORING_OP_NOP;` in `io_msg_remote_post()` on line 96 of `io_uring/msg_ring.c`. This function is called when creating remote message requests between io_uring contexts. ### Why this is not a security vulnerability: 1. **Preventive hardening, not vulnerability fix**: The commit message states it's "risky to have msg request opcode set to garbage" and suggests adding this "at least" as a precaution. This indicates it's a hardening measure rather than fixing a known vulnerability. 2. **Request allocation includes zero initialization**: The `io_msg_get_kiocb()` function allocates requests using `kmem_cache_alloc(req_cachep, GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOWARN | __GFP_ZERO)` (line 117), which includes `__GFP_ZERO` flag, meaning the memory is already zeroed out. 3. **IORING_OP_NOP is safe**: Setting the opcode to `IORING_OP_NOP` (which has value 0) is inherently safe - it's a no-operation that doesn't perform any potentially dangerous actions. 4. **No exploitation vector described**: Unlike Similar Commits 2 and 4 which explicitly address speculation attacks with `array_index_nospec()`, this commit doesn't identify a specific attack vector or exploitation method. 5. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVE status (commits 2 and 4) specifically addressed opcode speculation attacks using `array_index_nospec()` to prevent Spectre-style attacks. This commit is fundamentally different - it's just ensuring a clean initial state. ### Context from similar commits: - Commits 2 & 4 (CVE: YES) specifically fixed speculation vulnerabilities using `array_index_nospec()` - Commits 1, 3 & 5 (CVE: NO) were defensive programming fixes without exploitable vulnerabilities This commit falls into the same category as the non-CVE commits - it's good defensive programming but doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability.
e18c09b204e81 arm64: Add support for HIP09 Spectre-BHB mitigation
- [sasha] **CVE Status: NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Reasoning:** 1. **Extending existing mitigations, not fixing new vulnerability**: The commit adds HIP09 processor support to the existing Spectre-BHB mitigation framework. The vulnerability (Spectre-BHB/Branch History Injection, related to CVE-2022-23960) was already known and mitigated - this just extends coverage to a new processor variant. 2. **Standard security maintenance**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" in the reference examples. Like the Qualcomm Kryo processors being added to various Spectre mitigation lists, this is routine security maintenance where CPU vendors disclose their processors are affected by known vulnerabilities. 3. **No new attack vector**: The code changes show HIP09 being added to the `spectre_bhb_k24_list[]` alongside other well-known vulnerable processors (Cortex-A76, A77, Neoverse-N1, Kryo 4XX Gold). This indicates it requires the same established 24-iteration loop mitigation, not a new type of fix. 4. **Preventive rather than reactive**: The commit message explicitly states it's adding "support for HIP09 Spectre-BHB mitigation" rather than fixing a newly discovered issue. This is proactive security hardening. 5. **Consistent with reference commits**: All the similar commits that added ARM cores to Spectre mitigation lists were marked "CVE Status: NO", establishing precedent that extending known mitigations to new processor variants doesn't warrant new CVEs. The security impact is protective (ensuring HIP09 systems are defended against known attacks) rather than addressing a new vulnerability requiring a separate CVE.
e255612b5ed9f cifs: Add fallback for SMB2 CREATE without FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **What the commit does:** 1. The commit adds a fallback mechanism in `smb2_open_file()` that tries to open files without `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` permission when the initial attempt with `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` fails with `-EACCES` 2. It specifically targets scenarios where write operations fail because the file doesn't grant `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` and the parent directory doesn't grant `READ_DATA` **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **This is a functionality enhancement, not a security fix**: The commit improves compatibility by allowing write operations to succeed in legitimate cases where `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` permission is not actually required for the operation 2. **No privilege escalation**: The change doesn't allow access to anything that shouldn't already be accessible - it just removes an unnecessarily restrictive permission check for operations that don't actually need it 3. **Proper permission checking remains**: The code still respects the actual permissions for the intended operation (e.g., write access) - it just doesn't require the additional `FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` permission when it's not explicitly needed 4. **Pattern matches similar commits**: Looking at the provided examples, this follows the same pattern as the "NO" CVE commits that are functionality improvements or compatibility fixes rather than security fixes **Similar to reference commits:** Like the other "NO" CVE commits provided, this is addressing a compatibility/functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability. It's improving the client's ability to work with servers that have specific permission configurations, not fixing a security flaw. The change makes the SMB client more permissive in a controlled way, but doesn't compromise security boundaries.
14e41b16e8cb6 SUNRPC: Don't allow waiting for exiting tasks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree investigation, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: **Analysis of the Code Change:** The commit adds a simple check `if (unlikely(current->flags & PF_EXITING)) return -EINTR;` to the `rpc_wait_bit_killable()` function. This prevents tasks that are in the process of exiting from entering a potentially indefinite wait state. **Why this is NOT a CVE-worthy security vulnerability:** 1. **No privilege escalation**: This doesn't allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation 2. **No memory corruption**: There are no buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues 3. **Reliability/stability fix**: This is primarily a system stability improvement rather than a security fix 4. **Limited attack surface**: While theoretically an attacker could try to cause resource exhaustion by triggering this condition, it would require legitimate RPC operations and wouldn't provide any meaningful attack advantage **Comparison with similar commits:** Looking at the provided examples, all similar commits were marked "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar reliability/race condition fixes in the SUNRPC subsystem without direct security implications. **Nature of the issue:** This fixes a potential hang condition where processes exiting while performing synchronous RPC operations could get stuck indefinitely. While this could theoretically contribute to resource exhaustion, it's fundamentally a robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The fix ensures proper cleanup during process termination but doesn't address any exploitable security flaw that would warrant CVE assignment.
d33d729afcc8a s390/vfio-ap: Fix no AP queue sharing allowed message written to kernel log
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, this is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Pure Log Message Fix**: The commit only modifies error message formatting and logging logic. The core security validation logic (`vfio_ap_mdev_verify_no_sharing` function) remains unchanged - it still properly prevents queue sharing and returns the appropriate error codes. 2. **No Security Impact**: The changes are: - Updated error message strings (`MDEV_SHARING_ERR` and new `MDEV_IN_USE_ERR`) - Added a new parameter (`assignee`) to distinguish between different error scenarios - Split logging into two functions for different use cases - The actual security checks and error returns (`-EADDRINUSE`) remain identical 3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the reference commits: - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed actual security logic where AP queues could be passed to guests despite not being bound to the driver - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) added missing validation that could allow untrusted drivers to cause kernel panics - This commit only improves diagnostic messages without changing validation logic 4. **Kernel Tree Analysis**: The commit in the kernel tree confirms this is purely a cosmetic/usability improvement for administrators to better understand why queue assignments fail, not a security fix. The commit addresses a user experience issue where error messages were confusing (showing the same mdev as both source and target), but the underlying security mechanisms that prevent unauthorized queue sharing were already working correctly.
a26fe287eed11 kconfig: merge_config: use an empty file as initfile
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with the similar commits provided, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit modifies the `merge_config.sh` script to create an empty file when the specified `INITFILE` doesn't exist, instead of exiting with an error. This is a usability improvement, not a security fix. 2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: The change doesn't address any security vulnerability. The previous behavior (exiting when file doesn't exist) was not a security issue - it was just a stricter requirement that made the script harder to use. 3. **Security implications of the change**: - The `touch "$INITFILE"` command creates an empty file using user-provided input - However, this happens in a controlled context where `INITFILE` is the first argument to the script - The file is only used as a base configuration file for merging Kconfig fragments - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access control issues are involved 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also build system/kconfig improvements that don't fix security vulnerabilities. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a kconfig build system enhancement. 5. **Impact assessment**: The change improves usability by allowing the script to work with non-existent initial files, but doesn't fix any exploitable security condition. The commit is a straightforward build system improvement that makes the merge_config.sh script more flexible by auto-creating missing input files, rather than a security fix warranting CVE assignment.
287906b20035a smb: client: Store original IO parameters and prevent zero IO sizes
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Primary Reasons:** 1. **Robustness fix, not security vulnerability**: The commit prevents zero IO sizes from being negotiated, which could cause system instability or failures, but this is a robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix. 2. **Limited security impact**: The issue only affects local mount operations and cannot be exploited for: - Remote code execution - Privilege escalation - Memory corruption - Information disclosure 3. **Defensive programming pattern**: The code changes show this is defensive programming to ensure consistent behavior across SMB protocol versions. The `prevent_zero_iosize()` function sets minimum values when zero is calculated, preventing potential divide-by-zero or infinite loop conditions. 4. **Already mitigated at mount level**: The existing `cifs_io_align()` function in the mount option parsing already handles zero sizes by setting them to PAGE_SIZE, so this adds an additional safety net rather than fixing an exploitable condition. 5. **Consistent with non-CVE patterns**: Comparing to the provided examples, this resembles commits marked "CVE Status: NO" which fix data corruption, performance issues, or robustness problems rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities. **Code analysis confirms**: The changes store original user parameters (`vol_rsize`/`vol_wsize`) and add zero-size validation (`prevent_zero_iosize()`) - these are system stability improvements, not security fixes addressing exploitable vulnerabilities.
e94e882a6d695 cifs: Fix negotiate retry functionality
- [sasha] **CVE Status: YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security analysis: **Primary Security Concerns:** 1. **TCP Status State Management Vulnerabilities**: The broken retry functionality creates race condition windows in critical authentication state transitions. The code shows proper validation like `if (server->tcpStatus == CifsInNegotiate)` after negotiate completion - if this check fails, it correctly returns `-EHOSTDOWN`, indicating this is a security-sensitive code path. 2. **Authentication Bypass Potential**: The original retry logic in individual negotiate callbacks (`cifs_negotiate()` and `smb2_negotiate()`) could lead to authentication bypasses by: - Allowing partially negotiated sessions to proceed - Creating inconsistent server authentication state during retries - Bypassing security context validation between retry attempts 3. **Race Conditions in Multi-threaded Environments**: The fix moves retry logic to `cifs_negotiate_protocol()` which properly manages the `tcpStatus` state transitions (`CifsInNegotiate` → `CifsGood`/`CifsNeedNegotiate`). The original broken implementation could allow concurrent negotiate attempts with inconsistent state management. **Code Evidence Supporting CVE Assignment:** - The commit message specifically mentions "broken and does not work when doing socket reconnect" and "tcpStatus is changed as so repeated CIFSSMBNegotiate() call does not help" - The fix includes proper handling of `-EAGAIN` errors which "requires that tcpStatus after successful execution stay in CifsInNegotiate" - Similar commits in the historical examples show that CIFS state management issues (like Similar Commits 3 & 4) have received CVEs for UAF prevention This represents a **moderate security vulnerability** affecting critical CIFS/SMB authentication negotiation that could lead to authentication bypasses or protocol downgrade attacks under specific network conditions.
75673fda0c557 bpf: fix possible endless loop in BPF map iteration
- [sasha] 548762f05d19c samples/bpf: Fix compilation failure for samples/bpf on LoongArch Fedora
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what the change does. The commit adds `$(CLANG_SYS_INCLUDES)` to the clang compilation line for BPF samples. This variable is used to automatically detect and include system header paths from clang, specifically to address a missing header file issue on LoongArch. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because: 1. **Build Fix, Not Security Issue**: The commit is purely a build system fix that addresses a compilation failure on LoongArch Fedora due to a missing header file (`larchintrin.h`). It doesn't fix any security vulnerability. 2. **No Security-Relevant Code Changes**: The change only adds `$(CLANG_SYS_INCLUDES)` to the compilation command line in `samples/bpf/Makefile` (line 379). This variable contains system include paths automatically detected from clang, similar to what's already used in the BPF selftests. 3. **Consistent with Existing Pattern**: Looking at the kernel tree, `CLANG_SYS_INCLUDES` is already used in multiple other Makefiles (`tools/testing/selftests/bpf/Makefile`, `samples/hid/Makefile`, etc.) for the same purpose - to ensure clang can find system headers. 4. **No Impact on Runtime Security**: The change only affects build-time header inclusion and has no impact on the compiled code's security properties or runtime behavior. 5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided as references (samples/bpf Makefile fixes, compilation error fixes) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the same pattern of being a build system fix rather than a security fix. The commit message clearly indicates this is about fixing compilation errors, not security issues, and the code change is minimal and non-security-related.
e5f1e8af9c9e1 x86/fred: Fix system hang during S4 resume with FRED enabled
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and the kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because it fixes a reliability/stability issue rather than a security vulnerability. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a system hang during S4 hibernation resume when FRED (Flexible Return and Event Delivery) is enabled. The problem occurs because FRED MSRs (Model Specific Registers) contain stale values from the restore kernel instead of the proper values needed by the image kernel. 2. **Failure Mode Analysis**: When FRED MSRs have incorrect values during hibernation resume: - Exception/interrupt handlers get wrong stack pointers or entry points - This leads to system hangs or crashes, not exploitable conditions - The system fails securely by hanging rather than continuing with corrupted state 3. **Limited Attack Surface**: - Only affects very recent Intel processors with FRED capability - Requires physical access to trigger hibernation/resume cycles - No remote attack vector exists - Only triggers during S4 resume, not normal operation 4. **Security vs Reliability**: The code changes in `arch/x86/power/cpu.c` (lines 245-248) simply reinitialize FRED MSRs during resume to prevent system instability. This is infrastructure maintenance to ensure proper exception handling, not a security fix. 5. **No Exploitable Conditions**: The incorrect MSR state leads to denial of service through system hangs, but creates no opportunities for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or code execution attacks. This is similar to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a system stability fix that prevents crashes/hangs rather than addressing an exploitable security vulnerability.
f2858f308131a selftests/bpf: Mitigate sockmap_ktls disconnect_after_delete failure
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the available information: **CVE Analysis:** **NO** **Explanation:** This commit is purely a test infrastructure fix with no security implications: 1. **Test-only change**: The modification only affects `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/sockmap_ktls.c`, which is a test file, not kernel production code. 2. **Simple assertion removal**: The only change is removing the line `ASSERT_OK(err, "disconnect");` on line 71. This removes a test assertion that was checking if a disconnect operation succeeded. 3. **Context from commit message**: The change is a temporary mitigation for CI test failures caused by a separate kernel change that "disabled disconnect for TLS." The commit explicitly states this is just removing a failing test assertion, not fixing any security vulnerability. 4. **No functional code impact**: This change doesn't affect any kernel functionality, security controls, memory management, access controls, or any other security-relevant systems. It only affects test validation logic. 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked as "CVE Status: NO") are also test-related changes that don't affect kernel security - they involve test infrastructure, test fixes, test additions, and test cleanup. This commit follows the same pattern. The commit message clearly indicates this is a temporary workaround for test CI failures, with the actual test planned for removal later. There are no security implications as this only affects test validation, not kernel behavior.
4236ac9fe5b8b cifs: Fix querying and creating MF symlinks over SMB1
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Based on my analysis of the code changes and context: 1. **Functionality Fix, Not Security Issue**: The commit fixes a compatibility problem where MF symlinks fail to work on old SMB1 servers (like Windows 98) that don't support `CAP_NT_SMBS`. The fix changes from directly calling `CIFS_open()` to using the `server->ops->open` callback, which properly handles legacy servers by using `SMBLegacyOpen()` when needed. 2. **No Security Impact**: The bug being fixed causes operation failures (EIO errors) rather than security vulnerabilities. There's no potential for: - Unauthorized access or privilege escalation - Information disclosure or data corruption - Memory corruption or buffer overflows - Bypass of security controls 3. **Limited Scope**: The issue only affects legacy Windows 98 systems and similar old SMB1-only servers when handling MF symlinks specifically. Modern systems and regular file operations are unaffected. 4. **Proper Error Handling**: The original bug results in clean error returns rather than undefined behavior or exploitable conditions. This is purely a compatibility improvement for legacy system support, similar to the other "NO CVE" commits in the reference list that fix SMB functionality issues without security implications.
c0e473a0d2264 block: fix race between set_blocksize and read paths
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I also examined the actual commit in the kernel tree to understand the full security implications. **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE. **Explanation:** This commit fixes a race condition that leads to a kernel crash, which constitutes a clear security vulnerability: 1. **Kernel crash vulnerability**: The race condition causes a NULL pointer dereference when `do_mpage_readahead` tries to create bufferheads but `blocks_per_folio == 0`, leading to no bufferheads being attached and a bio submitted with NULL block device. 2. **Triggerable by normal operations**: The crash can be triggered by unprivileged user operations during normal system activities - specifically when udev scans block devices concurrently with filesystem mounting operations. 3. **Race condition fix**: The code changes add proper locking (`inode_lock()` and `filemap_invalidate_lock()`) throughout multiple files (bdev.c, fops.c, ioctl.c, blk-zoned.c) to prevent the race between `set_blocksize` and read operations. 4. **Availability impact**: This represents a denial-of-service vulnerability as it can crash the kernel during routine system operations. 5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commits 2 & 3 which were assigned CVEs - both fixed race conditions leading to kernel crashes (use-after-free and slab-use-after-free respectively). The specific vulnerability occurs when `set_blocksize` changes `i_blkbits` and folio order while concurrent readers are accessing the same block device, leading to inconsistent state and ultimately a crash when submitting I/O with uninitialized block device pointers.
e03463d247dda block: hoist block size validation code to a separate function
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, I can now provide a comprehensive assessment. **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE because it is a pure code refactoring that does not fix any security vulnerability or change any security-relevant behavior. **Detailed Analysis:** 1. **No security logic changes**: The commit simply extracts existing validation code from `set_blocksize()` into a new function `bdev_validate_blocksize()`. The validation logic remains identical: - Same call to `blk_validate_block_size()` (which validates size is 512 ≤ bsize ≤ BLK_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE and power of 2) - Same check that block_size ≥ device logical block size 2. **No vulnerability fix**: The commit message explicitly states the purpose is to "hoist block size validation code to a separate function" for code reuse by filesystems that don't need the pagecache manipulations of `set_blocksize()`. There's no mention of fixing any bug or security issue. 3. **Identical behavior**: The `set_blocksize()` function now calls `bdev_validate_blocksize()` instead of doing validation inline, but the validation checks and error handling are exactly the same. 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: This closely resembles Similar Commits 1 and 2 (both NO CVE) which were also refactoring commits. In contrast, Similar Commits 3, 4, and 5 (all YES CVE) actually **fixed validation bugs** that could cause crashes - they weren't just moving code around. This is a textbook example of a refactoring commit that improves code organization without changing functionality or fixing security issues.
756c85e4d0ddc drm/amd/display: Enable urgent latency adjustment on DCN35
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Display Performance Fix, Not Security Issue**: The commit is enabling an urgent latency adjustment feature on DCN35 display hardware to prevent underflows during high timing configurations. This is a display performance/stability fix, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Nature of the Change**: The code changes two boolean/numeric parameters in a display configuration structure: - `do_urgent_latency_adjustment = 1` (enables the feature) - `urgent_latency_adjustment_fabric_clock_reference_mhz = 3000` (sets reference frequency) 3. **No Security Implications**: - The urgent latency adjustment affects display timing calculations to prevent underflows - This is purely about display hardware performance optimization - No access control, memory safety, input validation, or privilege escalation concerns - No sensitive data or security boundaries are affected 4. **Historical Pattern**: Looking at the git history shows this feature has been repeatedly enabled and disabled based on compatibility issues with specific monitors/platforms (P0 enablement issues), which confirms this is about display compatibility, not security. 5. **Similar Commits Precedent**: All the similar commits provided as examples (changing DRAM latencies, bandwidth efficiency, etc.) were correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO" and represent the same class of display timing/performance adjustments. The commit mentions this "reverts commit 3412860cc4c0c484f53f91b371483e6e4440c3e5" - this is simply re-enabling a display performance feature that was previously disabled due to monitor compatibility issues, after testing showed it can be safely re-enabled.
f76d4c28a46a9 fs/jbd2: use sleeping version of __find_get_block()
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding. The key difference is: - `__find_get_block()` (atomic=true): Uses `spin_lock(&bd_mapping->i_private_lock)` - cannot sleep - `__find_get_block_nonatomic()` (atomic=false): Uses `folio_lock(folio)` - can sleep Now let me examine the actual commit changes in the revoke.c file: **CVE Analysis:** **NO** This commit is **NOT** a security vulnerability that requires a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of Change**: This is a performance optimization and API migration, not a security fix. The commit message explicitly states it's converting to "benefit from potential performance benefits and adapt in the future vs migration such that semantics are kept." 2. **Code Analysis**: The changes replace `__find_get_block()` with `__find_get_block_nonatomic()` in three functions: - `jbd2_journal_revoke()` - `jbd2_journal_cancel_revoke()` - `jbd2_clear_buffer_revoked_flags()` 3. **Functional Equivalence**: Both functions perform the exact same buffer lookup operation. The only difference is: - Old: Uses spinlock (atomic context, cannot sleep) - New: Uses folio_lock (can sleep in sleeping contexts) 4. **Context Validation**: The commit message explicitly validates that all call sites can sleep: - `jbd2_journal_revoke()` has `might_sleep()` annotation - `jbd2_journal_cancel_revoke()` is called from functions that sleep - `jbd2_clear_buffer_revoked_flags()` is called from journal commit code that sleeps 5. **No Security Impact**: - No buffer overflow fixes - No memory leak fixes - No access control changes - No input validation changes - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation fixes 6. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The reference commits show similar non-security maintenance changes (function exports, refactoring, sleep annotations) that were correctly marked as NO CVE. This is a maintenance commit that improves performance by using a more appropriate locking mechanism in contexts where sleeping is allowed, with no security implications.
5e16f1a68d289 io_uring: don't duplicate flushing in io_req_post_cqe
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is an optimization/cleanup fix that eliminates duplicate CQE (completion queue entry) flushing rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The commit message explicitly states it's about preventing double flushing: "Don't commit it twice by using __io_cq_unlock_post()." 2. **Code analysis**: The change replaces the use of `__io_cq_lock()` and `__io_cq_unlock_post()` with manual locking/unlocking to avoid the automatic flushing that `__io_cq_unlock_post()` performs. This prevents duplicate work since `ctx->submit_state.cq_flush = true` is set to indicate that flushing will be handled later by batch completion processing. 3. **Comparison to similar commits**: All 5 similar commits provided as references were marked with "CVE Status: NO", and they involved similar io_uring completion handling improvements, locking optimizations, and correctness fixes rather than security vulnerabilities. 4. **No security implications**: The change doesn't fix buffer overflows, memory leaks, access control issues, input validation problems, race conditions that could lead to privilege escalation, or other traditional security vulnerabilities. It's a performance optimization that eliminates redundant work. 5. **Risk assessment**: While eliminating duplicate processing improves correctness and could theoretically prevent some undefined behavior, there's no indication this could be exploited for security purposes or lead to memory corruption. This appears to be a straightforward code optimization to improve efficiency in the io_uring completion path, consistent with the pattern of similar commits that were not assigned CVEs.
2814a7d3d2ff5 fs/buffer: introduce sleeping flavors for pagecache lookups
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because: 1. **It's a performance optimization, not a security fix**: The commit introduces non-atomic variants of buffer cache lookup functions (`__find_get_block_nonatomic()` and `sb_find_get_block_nonatomic()`) that allow sleeping contexts to use more efficient folio locking instead of the mapping's `i_private_lock`. 2. **No vulnerability is being fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is about introducing "sleeping flavors for pagecache lookups" and the comment in the code says "same as __find_get_block() but allows sleeping contexts". This is about adding new functionality, not fixing a security issue. 3. **The locking change is intentional and safe**: Looking at `__find_get_block_slow()` at lines 202-205 and 247-250, the code properly handles both atomic and non-atomic contexts: - Atomic contexts use `spin_lock(&bd_mapping->i_private_lock)` - Non-atomic contexts use `folio_lock(folio)` Both provide proper synchronization - the choice depends on whether the caller can sleep. 4. **No sensitive operations affected**: This is buffer cache management code that handles performance optimization for block device I/O. The security-critical aspects (proper locking and synchronization) are maintained in both variants. 5. **Comparison with CVE-worthy commits**: Unlike the similar commits shown (which fix null pointer dereferences, race conditions, and memory corruption issues), this commit is purely additive functionality that doesn't address any existing vulnerability. The commit represents a legitimate kernel optimization that provides filesystem code with more efficient buffer lookup options when sleeping is allowed, without introducing or fixing any security vulnerabilities.
6e8f57fd09c9f fs/ext4: use sleeping version of sb_find_get_block()
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. **Analysis:** 1. **Performance optimization, not security fix**: The commit changes `sb_find_get_block()` to `sb_find_get_block_nonatomic()` in `ext4_free_blocks()`. The commit message explicitly states this is for "performance benefits" and "future adaptation," not security. 2. **Context already supports sleeping**: The code is in a loop that already calls `cond_resched()` immediately before this change, indicating the function was designed to run in contexts where sleeping is acceptable. 3. **Locking mechanism difference**: - `sb_find_get_block()` uses atomic spinlock locking (`spin_lock(&bd_mapping->i_private_lock)`) - `sb_find_get_block_nonatomic()` uses folio locking (`folio_lock(folio)`) which can sleep This change reduces lock contention rather than fixing a vulnerability. 4. **Part of optimization series**: The merge commit shows this is part of a larger series focused on "reducing contention on the spinlock for bdev mappings" and providing "potential performance gains," not fixing security issues. 5. **No security vulnerability patterns**: The code changes show none of the typical security fix indicators: - No buffer overflows being fixed - No memory leaks being addressed - No access control improvements - No input validation enhancements - No race conditions being resolved (actually reduces locking overhead) 6. **Direction of change**: Unlike similar "sleep in atomic context" CVE fixes, this moves FROM atomic TO sleeping operations in a context that already permitted sleeping, indicating optimization rather than bug correction. The change at `fs/ext4/mballoc.c:6645-6646` is a straightforward API substitution to improve performance by using sleeping locks instead of spinning locks where sleeping is safe.
cae5572ec9261 dma-mapping: Fix warning reported for missing prototype
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze this commit: **CVE Status: NO** This commit is purely a documentation fix that addresses a kernel build warning about missing function prototypes. The code changes are: 1. **Moving kernel-doc comments**: The commit moves the kernel-doc comment block from above the `__dma_addressing_limited()` static function to above the `dma_addressing_limited()` exported function. 2. **No functional changes**: There are absolutely no changes to the actual logic, functionality, or behavior of any code. The functions themselves remain completely unchanged. 3. **Documentation synchronization**: The issue was that the kernel-doc comment was documenting the wrong function - it was placed above the static helper function `__dma_addressing_limited()` but was actually describing the public API function `dma_addressing_limited()`. 4. **Build warning fix**: This addresses a kernel test robot (lkp) warning about missing prototype documentation, which is purely a build/documentation issue. **Security Analysis**: - No memory management changes - No access control modifications - No input validation changes - No buffer handling modifications - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation concerns - No functional code changes whatsoever **Comparison to similar commits**: This is most similar to "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which were both documentation/build fixes with CVE Status: NO. Like those commits, this only fixes documentation/build warnings without any functional changes. The commit is a pure documentation cleanup with zero security implications.
b0b7ee3b574a7 scsi: mpi3mr: Add level check to control event logging
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a security assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds a simple debug level check (`if (!(mrioc->logging_level & MPI3_DEBUG_EVENT))`) at line 177-178 in the `mpi3mr_print_event_data()` function to prevent unnecessary event logging when debug logging is disabled. 2. **No Security Impact**: This change: - Does not fix any buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - Does not address input validation problems or race conditions - Does not fix privilege escalation vulnerabilities - Only controls when debug information is printed to logs 3. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states the purpose is to "prevent unnecessary logging" and ensure event logs are only generated when the specific debug level `MPI3_DEBUG_EVENT` is enabled. This is purely a performance/logging optimization. 4. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the function, it processes various MPI3 events (device added/removed, SAS discovery, PCIe enumeration, etc.) and prints descriptive messages using `ioc_info()`. The added check simply returns early if the debug flag isn't set, preventing any log output. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: This is most similar to "Similar Commit 4" and "Similar Commit 5" which were both marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they deal with logging optimizations and improvements without security implications. This is a straightforward code quality improvement that reduces unnecessary log verbosity and has no security implications whatsoever.
fec0abf52609c vhost_task: fix vhost_task_create() documentation
- [sasha] Let me examine the documentation change in more detail by looking at the actual change being made: Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, this is clearly a **documentation-only fix**. Let me examine the specific changes: ## Analysis **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE. ### Explanation: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a documentation fix. The only change is updating a comment in the function documentation from: - Old: `"This returns a specialized task for use by the vhost layer or NULL on failure"` - New: `"This returns a specialized task for use by the vhost layer or ERR_PTR() on failure"` 2. **No functional code changes**: The commit doesn't modify any actual code logic, security mechanisms, or data handling. It only corrects outdated documentation to reflect a previous change (cb380909ae3b) that modified the function's return value behavior. 3. **No security implications**: - No buffer overflows, memory leaks, or access control issues - No input validation changes - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation potential - No change to actual runtime behavior 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also a minor error handling improvement with no security impact - Similar Commits 3-5 (YES CVE): These had actual functional changes that fixed security vulnerabilities (SIGKILL handling, null pointer dereferences) 5. **Reference to previous change**: The commit references cb380909ae3b which changed the actual return value behavior, but this current commit is just catching up the documentation to match that previously implemented change. This is a pure documentation maintenance commit with zero security impact. It should not receive a CVE assignment.
a0b5ff0749101 fs/ocfs2: use sleeping version of __find_get_block()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and extensive examination of the Linux kernel source code, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE because it represents a **security improvement** rather than fixing a vulnerability. **Detailed Analysis:** 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit changes from `__find_get_block()` to `__find_get_block_nonatomic()` in OCFS2 journal operations. This is not fixing a bug or vulnerability, but rather adopting a more appropriate API for the context. 2. **Technical Improvements**: - The nonatomic version uses stronger locking mechanisms (folio locks vs spinlocks) - It provides better protection against buffer migration races - It's more suitable for contexts where sleeping is allowed (like journal recovery) 3. **Code Context**: The change occurs in `ocfs2_force_read_journal()` during journal recovery operations, which is not an atomic context and can safely use the sleeping version. 4. **Security Impact**: This change **improves** security and reliability by: - Better handling of buffer migration scenarios - Using more appropriate synchronization primitives - Enhancing buffer cache coherency in clustered filesystems 5. **Commit Message Analysis**: The commit message explicitly states this is for "potential performance benefits" and to "adapt in the future vs migration such that semantics are kept" - indicating this is a proactive improvement, not a security fix. 6. **Similar Patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits, this resembles commits with "CVE Status: NO" that are performance optimizations or code cleanups rather than security fixes. The change represents a proactive enhancement to use a more appropriate API variant, similar to how kernel code evolves to adopt better practices over time. It does not fix an existing vulnerability or security flaw.
a92741e72f91b drm/amdgpu: Allow P2P access through XGMI
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and the codebase, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: **1. Performance Enhancement, Not Security Fix** This commit is clearly a performance optimization that allows P2P (peer-to-peer) access through XGMI instead of forcing memory migration to GTT. The commit message and code changes show this is about improving performance for legitimate use cases, not fixing a security vulnerability. **2. Adds New Security Checks, Doesn't Remove Them** The key changes actually **enhance** security validation: - Line 85-86: `if (!amdgpu_dmabuf_is_xgmi_accessible(attach_adev, bo) &&` - This adds an additional check before the existing PCI P2P validation - Line 513-514: `if (!adev) return false;` - Adds a null pointer validation that was missing before - Lines 203-205: Adds a WARN_ON to catch improper DMA mapping of XGMI memory **3. Similar to Reference Commits Marked "NO CVE"** Looking at the similar commits provided as references, this follows the same pattern as commits marked "CVE Status: NO": - Similar Commit 1: Performance optimization for GTT handling (NO CVE) - Similar Commit 2: DMA-buf export handling improvement (NO CVE) - Similar Commit 3: Adding shared stats functionality (NO CVE) - Similar Commit 5: Memory allocation optimization (NO CVE) **4. No Evidence of Fixing Exploitable Vulnerability** The code changes don't show patterns typical of security fixes: - No buffer overflow fixes - No access control bypasses being closed - No input validation improvements for untrusted data - No race condition fixes - No privilege escalation fixes **5. XGMI Access is Properly Controlled** The `amdgpu_xgmi_same_hive()` function (line 85) ensures access is only allowed between devices in the same XGMI hive, which is the intended and secure behavior for this hardware feature. This commit represents a legitimate performance enhancement for AMD's XGMI interconnect technology, adding proper validation checks while enabling a new optimization path. It does not fix a security vulnerability and should not receive a CVE assignment.
7ffe3de53a885 fs/buffer: split locking for pagecache lookups
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and the kernel code, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit is **not** a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: ## Analysis Summary **1. Nature of the Change:** This is primarily a **performance optimization** that introduces dual locking paths for buffer cache lookups, not a security fix. The commit message explicitly states "No change in semantics. All lookup users still take the spinlock." **2. Code Changes Analysis:** - Introduces an `atomic` parameter to `__find_get_block_slow()` - `atomic=true`: Uses existing `i_private_lock` spinlock (same as before) - `atomic=false`: Uses `folio_lock()` instead - Creates `find_get_block_common()` wrapper but `__find_get_block()` still uses `atomic=true` **3. Security Implications:** While the change introduces potential for race conditions between buffer lookup and `try_to_free_buffers()`, several factors mitigate the security risk: - **No immediate exploit path**: All current callers still use the atomic (spinlock) path - **Race window is minimal**: Between getting buffer head pointer and incrementing reference count - **Existing protections**: Buffer reference counting and `buffer_busy()` checks provide additional safety - **Intentional design**: The dual-path approach maintains the existing safe behavior while enabling future optimizations **4. Comparison to Similar Commits:** Looking at the historical examples: - Similar commits marked "NO" were performance optimizations without security implications - Similar commits marked "YES" were actual fixes for use-after-free vulnerabilities with clear attack vectors **5. Intent and Implementation:** This appears to be preparatory work for future performance improvements rather than fixing an existing vulnerability. The careful preservation of existing semantics and the fact that all users continue to use the safe atomic path indicates this is not addressing a security issue. The commit is a performance infrastructure change that maintains security through careful design rather than fixing a vulnerability.
5b67d43976828 fs/buffer: use sleeping version of __find_get_block()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message, code changes, and additional kernel context: **NO** This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Performance/Code Quality Enhancement, Not a Bug Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is "Convert to the new nonatomic flavor to benefit from potential performance benefits" and "There are no changes in semantics." This indicates it's an optimization rather than fixing a vulnerability. 2. **Security Enhancement, Not Vulnerability Fix**: The code changes actually improve security by: - Using `__find_get_block_nonatomic()` which provides stronger serialization through folio locks - Better protection against race conditions in buffer cache operations - Improved handling of buffer migration scenarios 3. **Safe Context Conversion**: The changes are made in contexts where sleeping is already allowed: - `write_boundary_block()` already takes buffer locks (can sleep) - `bdev_getblk()` uses `gfpflags_allow_blocking(gfp)` to determine if sleeping is safe 4. **No Vulnerability Being Fixed**: The commit doesn't mention fixing any security issue, race condition, or data corruption. It's purely about using a better implementation where appropriate. 5. **Pattern Matches Non-CVE Examples**: This resembles the historical similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they involve refactoring, optimization, or code modernization without fixing actual security vulnerabilities. The commit represents a proactive improvement to use stronger locking mechanisms where safe to do so, rather than reactive fixing of a security flaw.
c9b19ea63036f dma-mapping: avoid potential unused data compilation warning
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what this commit actually changes in terms of behavior. This is crucial for understanding any potential security implications. **Analysis:** **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit is purely a compiler warning fix with no functional or security implications. The analysis shows: 1. **Pure Compilation Fix**: The commit only modifies the macro definitions for the `!CONFIG_NEED_DMA_MAP_STATE` case. This is the case where DMA mapping state tracking is NOT needed (typically on architectures with coherent DMA). 2. **No Functional Change**: The old macros returned `(0)` and used `do { } while (0)`, while the new macros use `({ typeof(PTR) __p __maybe_unused = PTR; 0; })` and similar constructs. Both versions: - Return 0 for `dma_unmap_addr()` and `dma_unmap_len()` - Do nothing for `dma_unmap_addr_set()` and `dma_unmap_len_set()` - The new version just ensures the compiler doesn't warn about unused parameters 3. **No Security Impact**: - No change to actual DMA handling logic - No change to memory access patterns - No change to buffer boundaries or validation - No change to access control or privilege handling - Only affects compiler warnings, not runtime behavior 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples, commits assigned CVE Status: YES typically fix actual functional issues like DMA mapping error handling, while CVE Status: NO commits are for compilation warnings, unused variables, or similar non-functional fixes. 5. **Code Context**: The `typeof(PTR) __p __maybe_unused = PTR` construct is a common GCC idiom to tell the compiler "we know this parameter exists and we're using it (to get its type), so don't warn about it being unused." This generates no runtime code. This is a textbook example of a build system/toolchain compatibility fix with zero security implications.
87c259a7a359e cgroup: Fix compilation issue due to cgroup_mutex not being exported
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the change**: The commit only modifies the conditional compilation of symbol exports. It changes `#ifdef CONFIG_PROVE_RCU` to `#if (defined CONFIG_PROVE_RCU || defined CONFIG_LOCKDEP)` for the export of `cgroup_mutex`. 2. **No functional security impact**: The change doesn't alter any security logic, access controls, or memory management functionality. It only resolves a compilation issue where lockdep assertions in `folio_memcg()` require access to `cgroup_mutex` for debugging purposes. 3. **Export is GPL-only**: The symbol is exported using `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()`, which restricts access to GPL-licensed modules only, maintaining the kernel's security boundaries. 4. **Debugging/development purpose**: The export is purely for lockdep debugging assertions (`lockdep_is_held(&cgroup_mutex)` in `obj_cgroup_memcg()` at line 361 of memcontrol.h). This doesn't create new attack vectors. 5. **No privilege escalation**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed actual use-after-free bugs, race conditions, and NULL pointer dereferences), this change only fixes a build-time symbol resolution issue. 6. **Comparison with CVE commits**: The reference commits that received CVEs were fixing actual runtime security vulnerabilities (UAF, race conditions, NULL pointer dereferences) affecting memory safety. This commit only fixes a compilation dependency without changing runtime behavior. The commit addresses a legitimate technical issue without introducing security vulnerabilities or changing the kernel's security posture.
f1ab0171e9be9 btrfs: tree-checker: adjust error code for header level check
- [sasha] Now I understand the context. Let me analyze the security implications based on all the information I've gathered: **CVE Status: NO** ## Analysis This commit changes only the error code returned by `btrfs_verify_level_key()` from `-EIO` (I/O error) to `-EUCLEAN` (Structure needs cleaning) when a tree level mismatch is detected. This is purely a cosmetic/consistency change with no security implications. **Key observations:** 1. **No functional change**: The commit only changes the error code returned, not the detection logic or any behavior when corruption is found. 2. **Consistency improvement**: The change unifies error handling across the tree-checker subsystem, which was noted to return `-EUCLEAN` for all other corruption checks except this one case. 3. **Same error handling**: Looking at the caller in `fs/btrfs/ctree.c:1482`, the function result is checked and if non-zero, `-EUCLEAN` is returned anyway, so the actual error propagated to upper layers remains the same. 4. **Historical context**: This error code was inherited when the function was moved from `disk-io.c` to `tree-checker.c` in commit 2cac5af16537, and the change simply aligns it with the rest of the tree-checker conventions. 5. **No privilege escalation or bypass**: This change does not affect any access controls, memory safety, or security boundaries. It's purely about error reporting consistency. The commit is a minor cleanup/refactoring change that improves code consistency without introducing any security vulnerabilities or changing any security-relevant behavior.
f88c0c72ffb01 mei: vsc: Use struct vsc_tp_packet as vsc-tp tx_buf and rx_buf type
- [sasha] **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **What this commit does:** 1. Changes the type of `vsc_tp.tx_buf` and `vsc_tp.rx_buf` from `void *` to `struct vsc_tp_packet *` for better type safety 2. Updates allocation from `VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE` to `sizeof(*tp->tx_buf)` using proper type-based sizing 3. Adds necessary type casts in functions that need to treat the buffers as byte arrays **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability:** 1. **No functional change**: The allocated buffer size remains identical since `sizeof(struct vsc_tp_packet)` equals `VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE` (as shown in the struct definition where buf is sized as `VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE - sizeof(struct vsc_tp_packet_hdr)`) 2. **Code cleanup, not bug fix**: This is purely a type safety improvement that follows the previous security fix (commit 00f1cc14da0f). The commit message shows no indication of fixing a vulnerability - it's improving code correctness and maintainability. 3. **No security implications**: The changes are: - Type declarations: `void *` → `struct vsc_tp_packet *` - Size calculation: `VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE` → `sizeof(*tp->tx_buf)` - Explicit casts where byte-level access is needed 4. **Context from similar commits**: Looking at the git history, this commit immediately follows the actual security fix (00f1cc14da0f) that addressed a buffer overflow. This commit is part of the cleanup series to improve type safety after that fix. 5. **No memory safety issues**: Unlike the previous fortify-panic fix which addressed an actual buffer overflow, this commit maintains the same buffer sizes and access patterns, just with better typing. This is a code quality improvement that makes the type system more accurate and self-documenting, but introduces no security vulnerabilities nor fixes any.
2042c352e21d1 dma/mapping.c: dev_dbg support for dma_addressing_limited
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the available context from the kernel tree, I can now provide a comprehensive security assessment. **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: **Analysis of the code changes:** The commit adds only a debug logging statement (`dev_dbg`) to the existing `dma_addressing_limited()` function. Specifically: 1. **Refactoring for debug support**: The existing `dma_addressing_limited()` function logic is moved to a new private helper `__dma_addressing_limited()`, with no functional changes to the core logic. 2. **Addition of debug logging**: The public `dma_addressing_limited()` function now calls the helper and adds a `dev_dbg()` call when DMA addressing is limited. 3. **No security-relevant functional changes**: The commit does not: - Fix any security vulnerabilities - Change access controls or permissions - Modify memory management behavior - Address buffer overflows, memory leaks, or race conditions - Alter privilege escalation paths - Change input validation logic **Context from related commits:** The commit references a performance issue (commit 7170130e4c72) where devices were unexpectedly forced to use bounce buffers, causing performance degradation for GPU systems. This debug enhancement was added to help developers identify when devices hit DMA addressing limitations that force bounce buffer usage. **Comparison with similar commits:** All the provided similar commits (5 examples) that add DMA mapping optimizations, performance improvements, and debug enhancements were marked "CVE Status: NO", which aligns with this assessment. **Conclusion:** This is purely a debugging/observability enhancement with no security implications. The functionality of `dma_addressing_limited()` remains unchanged - only debug logging was added to help developers troubleshoot performance issues related to bounce buffer usage.
6aa9f1c9cd09c cifs: Fix access_flags_to_smbopen_mode
- [sasha] Now I can see the exact old implementation and analyze the security implications. **CVE Status: NO** This commit fixes a logic bug in access flag handling but does not address a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. ## Analysis: ### Old Implementation Issues: The old code had a fundamentally flawed logic: ```c int masked_flags = access_flags & (GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE); if (masked_flags == GENERIC_READ) return SMBOPEN_READ; else if (masked_flags == GENERIC_WRITE) return SMBOPEN_WRITE; /bin /bin.usr-is-merged /boot /dev /etc /home /init /lib /lib.usr-is-merged /lib64 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /root /run /sbin /sbin.usr-is-merged /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var just go for read/write linux/ return SMBOPEN_READWRITE; ``` ### Key Problems in Old Code: 1. **Only checked GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE**: Ignored specific access flags like `FILE_WRITE_DATA`, `DELETE`, `WRITE_DAC`, etc. 2. **Incorrect fallback**: Defaulted to `SMBOPEN_READWRITE` for any other combination, potentially over-granting access 3. **Missing execute handling**: No support for `SMBOPEN_EXECUTE` mode ### Why This Is NOT a CVE: 1. **Functional Bug, Not Security Hole**: The old logic typically resulted in **over-granting** access (defaulting to read/write), not under-granting it. This means the server would enforce proper access controls. 2. **Server-Side Enforcement**: SMB servers validate actual access permissions based on file ACLs and user credentials regardless of the requested open mode. The client open mode is a hint, not a security boundary. 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug doesn't allow bypassing authentication or accessing files the user shouldn't have access to - it just affects how the client requests file handles. 4. **Limited Impact**: At worst, this could cause: - Performance issues (requesting broader access than needed) - Application compatibility problems - Incorrect file handle types ### Comparison to CVE-Worthy Similar Commits: The CVE-worthy commits in the examples all fixed **Use-After-Free (UAF)** vulnerabilities where sessions being torn down could cause memory corruption. This commit fixes access flag mapping logic without memory safety implications. This is a code quality and correctness improvement, not a security fix requiring CVE assignment.
2e2f925fe7375 virtio_ring: Fix data race by tagging event_triggered as racy for KCSAN
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **1. Non-Security Nature**: This is purely a data race annotation fix for KCSAN (Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer), not a security vulnerability fix. The commit explicitly states that `event_triggered` is "an unreliable hint used for optimization." **2. Intentional Race Design**: The code comments show this data race is intentional and benign: - Line 878-879: "If device triggered an event already it won't trigger one again: no need to disable" - The field serves as a performance hint, not a security-critical variable **3. No Security Impact**: The race condition only affects an optimization hint that controls interrupt notifications. The worst case is temporary performance degradation where the device might send unnecessary interrupt notifications or miss an optimization opportunity - this has no security implications. **4. Cosmetic Fix**: The change only adds `data_race()` annotation around an existing write (`vq->event_triggered = false`) to suppress KCSAN warnings. This is a documentation/tooling fix, not a functional change. **5. Comparison with CVE-Worthy Examples**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES": - Those involved critical subsystems (memory management, networking control paths, RCU) - Had potential for corruption, crashes, or undefined behavior - This commit only affects a performance hint in virtio interrupt handling **6. Limited Scope**: The race only occurs between `virtqueue_enable_cb_delayed()` setting the flag to false and `virtqueue_disable_cb_split()` reading it - both are performance optimization paths with no security boundaries. The commit correctly identifies and documents an intentional, benign data race without fixing any actual vulnerability.
7f533cc5ee4c4 scsi: target: iscsi: Fix timeout on deleted connection
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code, here's my assessment: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Security Impact Analysis: 1. **Kernel NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit message explicitly shows a kernel NULL pointer dereference crash with a clear stack trace, indicating a critical security vulnerability that could lead to denial of service. 2. **Race Condition Leading to Use-After-Free**: The issue stems from a race condition where: - The nopin response timer may expire on a deleted connection - When `iscsit_handle_nopin_timeout` (line 947) calls `iscsit_add_nopin(conn, 1)` with `want_response=1` - This triggers `iscsit_start_nopin_response_timer(conn)` (line 846) - The nopin response timer can then expire and call `iscsit_handle_nopin_response_timeout` - This accesses `sess->sess_ops->InitiatorName` (in `iscsit_fill_cxn_timeout_err_stats`) on a potentially freed connection 3. **Timer Ordering Fix**: The fix reorders the timer shutdown sequence: ```c - iscsit_stop_nopin_response_timer(conn); iscsit_stop_nopin_timer(conn); + iscsit_stop_nopin_response_timer(conn); ``` This prevents the nopin timer from restarting the nopin response timer during shutdown. ## Comparison with Historical CVE Examples: This commit closely matches the pattern of **Similar Commit 3** (CVE-assigned) and **Similar Commit 4** (CVE-assigned): - **Race condition between timers and cleanup code** (similar to Similar Commit 3) - **NULL pointer dereference during timeout handling** (similar to Similar Commit 1) - **Use-after-free scenario** (similar to Similar Commit 4) The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially crash the kernel through a race condition in the iSCSI target implementation, constituting a denial of service attack vector.
8e553520596bb intel_th: avoid using deprecated page->mapping, index fields
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, I can now provide my security assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's why: ## Analysis Summary This commit is a **code modernization/cleanup** rather than a security fix. The changes: 1. **Replace deprecated page struct field usage**: The commit modernizes the code by replacing direct usage of deprecated `page->mapping` and `page->index` fields, which are being moved to folio structures in newer kernels. 2. **Use proper VM fault handling**: The code switches from manually setting `vmf->page`, `page->mapping`, and `page->index` to using the proper `vmf_insert_mixed()` API with `VM_MIXEDMAP`. 3. **Remove unnecessary cleanup code**: Eliminates manual `page->mapping = NULL` assignments during buffer cleanup since this is no longer needed with the new approach. 4. **Add CONFIG_MMU dependency**: Makes the existing MMU requirement explicit in Kconfig. ## Security Assessment **No security vulnerabilities are being fixed:** - **No buffer overflows or memory corruption issues addressed** - **No access control changes** - the same `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` requirements remain - **No privilege escalation fixes** - user permission model is unchanged - **No race condition fixes** - the same atomic reference counting is preserved - **No input validation improvements** - page offset validation logic is identical **The changes are functionally equivalent:** - Before: Manual page fault handling with direct field assignment - After: Using proper kernel API (`vmf_insert_mixed()`) for the same operation - Both approaches pin pages and provide identical access patterns **Similar commits in the reference set are also marked "NO":** - The provided examples show similar memory management modernization commits (udmabuf vmf_insert_pfn, io_uring vmap changes) that were correctly assessed as non-security related. This is a **maintenance commit** that updates deprecated APIs to their modern equivalents without changing the security posture or functionality of the intel_th subsystem.
6786484223d57 nvmem: core: update raw_len if the bit reading is required
- [sasha] Let me check the changelog more carefully and understand the issue. Based on my analysis, let me understand what happens when raw_len is not updated: **Analysis:** Looking at the code change, this commit addresses a specific issue in NVMEM cell handling: 1. **The Problem**: When an NVMEM cell uses bit offset or specifies bit truncation (`cell->nbits` is set), the code correctly updates `cell->bytes` to account for the additional bytes needed, but it was NOT updating `cell->raw_len` to match. 2. **The Consequence**: Since `raw_len` is used in: - `nvmem_reg_read(nvmem, cell->offset, buf, cell->raw_len)` (line 1693) - Buffer allocation: `kzalloc(max_t(size_t, entry->raw_len, entry->bytes), GFP_KERNEL)` (line 1735) 3. **Security Implications**: Without this fix: - If `raw_len` is smaller than the newly calculated `cell->bytes`, the buffer allocation might be too small - `nvmem_reg_read()` would read `raw_len` bytes into a buffer that might have been allocated for `max(raw_len, bytes)` - This could potentially lead to out-of-bounds reads if `raw_len < bytes` and the device actually tries to read beyond the allocated buffer size 4. **The Fix**: The commit ensures `raw_len` is properly aligned to `nvmem->word_size` when bit operations are required, ensuring that memory access remains word-aligned and the buffer size is consistent. 5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits: - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) was a shift-out-of-bounds fix - a clear memory safety issue - Similar Commit 1 (CVE Status: NO) was a buffer overflow prevention but didn't involve potential memory corruption - This commit is more similar to buffer boundary/alignment issues **CVE Assessment:** This is primarily a **correctness fix** rather than a **security vulnerability**. While it could theoretically cause memory access issues, the impact is limited because: - The memory access patterns are controlled by the NVMEM framework - Buffer allocation uses `max(raw_len, bytes)` which provides some protection - The issue affects alignment and consistency rather than creating exploitable memory corruption **NO** This commit fixes a correctness issue with raw_len alignment for bit-level NVMEM cell operations but does not represent a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment. The fix ensures proper word-alignment and buffer sizing consistency, but the potential for memory corruption is limited due to the protective buffer allocation logic using `max(raw_len, bytes)`.
569330a34a31a scsi: ufs: Introduce quirk to extend PA_HIBERN8TIME for UFS devices
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me provide my assessment: **CVE Status: NO** This commit introduces a performance/compatibility quirk for Samsung UFS devices and does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit adds a device-specific quirk (`UFS_DEVICE_QUIRK_PA_HIBER8TIME`) that extends the hibernation timing parameter by 100µs for Samsung UFS devices. This is purely a timing adjustment to ensure proper device behavior. 2. **Code Analysis**: - The new function `ufshcd_quirk_override_pa_h8time()` simply reads the current `PA_HIBERN8TIME` value and increments it by 1 (which translates to 100µs) - This quirk is applied only to Samsung devices (`UFS_VENDOR_SAMSUNG`) in the device quirks table - The function has proper error handling and only logs errors on failure 3. **Security Implications**: - This is a timing adjustment for power management/hibernation, not a security fix - No access control, memory safety, or privilege escalation issues are addressed - No validation fixes or buffer overflow corrections are present - The change is additive and defensive (increases timing tolerance) 4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar UFS power management, hibernation timing, and device quirk adjustments - none of which are security-related. 5. **Commit Message Analysis**: The commit message clearly states this is for "proper hibernation process" due to Samsung devices requiring "additional time in hibern8 mode" - this indicates a compatibility/timing issue, not a security vulnerability. This is a standard hardware compatibility fix that improves device reliability but has no security implications.
3566a737db87a nvmem: qfprom: switch to 4-byte aligned reads
- [sasha] **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis: **Reasoning:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability Present**: While the code changes from byte-level to word-level reads, this is an **architectural requirement fix**, not a security bug fix. The commit message clearly states this is needed for newer Snapdragon platforms (SM8450+) that require 4-byte reads. 2. **Proper Mitigation**: The potential buffer overrun concern is mitigated by: - The `qfprom_fixup_dt_cell_info()` function that aligns cell info to word boundaries - The NVMEM framework that controls how this function is called - The change affects the internal driver implementation, not the external API 3. **Functional Improvement, Not Security Fix**: This is a hardware compatibility change to support newer platforms, similar to the reference commits which were also marked "CVE Status: NO". The commit message mentions no security concerns, only hardware compatibility requirements. 4. **No Exploitability**: Even if there were a buffer overrun (which is properly handled), this would be a driver internal issue affecting NVMEM operations, not something exploitable for privilege escalation or system compromise. 5. **Consistent with Similar Changes**: The reference commits show similar NVMEM alignment and size fixes that were not assigned CVEs, indicating this type of change doesn't typically warrant CVE assignment. The commit is a hardware compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability repair.
7a06ef7510779 nvmem: core: fix bit offsets of more than one byte
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code changes and comparing with the similar commits provided: **NO** This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message states it's to "support bit offsets of more than 8 bits" - this is about extending functionality to handle legitimate use cases with NVMEM stride. 2. **Validation Changes**: The validation logic changes from `info.bit_offset >= BITS_PER_BYTE` to `info.bit_offset >= BITS_PER_BYTE linux info.bytes` are making the validation more permissive to allow larger, legitimate bit offsets, not fixing a security hole. 3. **Buffer Access Pattern**: While the `nvmem_shift_read_buffer_in_place` function is reworked, the changes properly calculate `bytes_offset = bit_offset / BITS_PER_BYTE` and adjust pointers accordingly. This appears to be correct handling of larger offsets rather than fixing an exploitable buffer overflow. 4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The CVE-assigned commits (Similar Commit 3 & 4) involved actual out-of-bounds writes where `regmap_read` would write beyond a small buffer. This commit doesn't show similar buffer overflow patterns. 5. **Missing Security Indicators**: The commit message doesn't mention security concerns, fixes, or vulnerabilities. It's presented as a feature enhancement for stride support. This appears to be a functional improvement to support NVMEM devices with stride requirements, not a security fix for an exploitable vulnerability.
13bcd440f2ff3 nvmem: core: verify cell's raw_len
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the NVMEM subsystem code, here's my evaluation: **CVE Status: NO** **Explanation:** This commit adds a validation check to ensure that NVMEM cell's `raw_len` is aligned to the device's `word_size`. While this is a correctness fix that prevents "incomplete reads," it does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment for the following reasons: 1. **Input Validation, Not Security Boundary**: The fix validates alignment constraints during cell registration (at driver initialization time), not during runtime data access. This is a data integrity check rather than a security boundary violation. 2. **Graceful Error Handling**: The code provides proper error handling - if the `raw_len` is unaligned and was explicitly set by the driver (`info->raw_len` is non-zero), it returns `-EINVAL`. If it was auto-calculated, it automatically aligns the value using `ALIGN()`. 3. **Developer-Facing Issue**: The "incomplete read" mentioned in the commit affects driver developers who may not configure NVMEM cells correctly, rather than creating exploitable conditions for attackers. 4. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the similar commits that show buffer overflow fixes, this commit doesn't address memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control violations. It addresses alignment requirements for hardware access. 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits**: All the provided similar commits (Similar Commit 1-5) that deal with NVMEM validation and alignment checks are marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of fix typically doesn't warrant CVE assignment. The fix ensures hardware access compliance and prevents potential hardware-level read issues, but does not create or fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited by malicious actors.
ea7789c154108 nvmet: pci-epf: Keep completion queues mapped
- [sasha] Let me analyze the available information without accessing the kernel tree. Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it introduces or fixes a security vulnerability. **Analysis of the commit:** 1. **Purpose**: This is a performance optimization that changes when completion queues are mapped/unmapped. Instead of mapping/unmapping on every `nvmet_pci_epf_cq_work()` call, it maps them once during queue creation and unmaps during deletion. 2. **Code Changes Analysis**: - **Queue mapping moved to creation**: The mapping logic is moved from `nvmet_pci_epf_cq_work()` to `nvmet_pci_epf_create_cq()` - **Queue unmapping moved to deletion**: Unmapping moved to `nvmet_pci_epf_delete_cq()` - **Error handling added**: New error paths in `nvmet_pci_epf_create_cq()` with proper cleanup - **Functions removed**: `nvmet_pci_epf_map_queue()` and `nvmet_pci_epf_unmap_queue()` are removed and open-coded 3. **Security Implications**: - **Memory management**: The commit changes when memory mappings are established and torn down - **Error handling**: Adds proper error handling with cleanup paths in case of mapping failures - **Resource lifecycle**: Ensures mappings are tied to queue lifecycle rather than individual operations 4. **Comparison with similar commits**: - Similar commits 1-3 (CVE Status: NO) are also performance/cleanup changes without security implications - Similar commits 4-5 (CVE Status: YES) fix actual null pointer dereference bugs with missing condition checks 5. **Security Assessment**: - This is purely a performance optimization - No fix for memory corruption, access control bypass, or other security vulnerabilities - The error handling actually improves robustness by adding proper cleanup paths - No mention of security issues in the commit message - The changes maintain the same security boundaries and access controls **NO** This commit is a performance optimization that changes the timing of memory mapping operations but does not fix any security vulnerability. The changes improve code organization and performance by keeping completion queues mapped during their entire lifecycle rather than mapping/unmapping repeatedly. The added error handling paths actually improve robustness. Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual null pointer dereference bugs, this commit does not address any security flaw.
fc5414a4774e1 cpufreq: Add SM8650 to cpufreq-dt-platdev blocklist
- [sasha] Now let me check the context of how this blocklist works. The key issue here is understanding the security implications: **Analysis Summary:** This commit adds SM8650 to the cpufreq-dt-platdev blocklist to prevent the generic cpufreq-dt driver from registering when the specialized qcom-cpufreq-hw driver should be used instead. **Security Analysis:** 1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit does NOT fix a security vulnerability. It fixes a driver conflict issue where two cpufreq drivers try to register for the same platform. 2. **Nature of the Issue**: - SM8650 platforms have dedicated qcom-cpufreq-hw driver support - The generic cpufreq-dt driver was also trying to register, causing an EEXIST (-17) error - This is purely a driver registration conflict, not a security issue 3. **Impact Assessment**: - The error is cosmetic - it generates noise in dmesg logs but doesn't affect functionality - The qcom-cpufreq-hw driver still works correctly as it registers first - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control issues - No buffer overflows, race conditions, or other security-relevant patterns 4. **Code Changes**: - Only adds one line: `{ .compatible = "qcom,sm8650", },` to the blocklist array - This is a simple platform identification change with no security implications 5. **Comparison to Historical Examples**: - Similar to "Similar Commit 4" (MODULE_DESCRIPTION addition) - purely maintenance - Similar to "Similar Commit 2" (platform driver cleanup) - also maintenance - Unlike "Similar Commits 1 & 3" which involved CPU ID handling that could have security implications **NO** This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. It fixes a driver registration conflict that produces harmless error messages in the kernel log, not a security vulnerability. The change only adds a platform compatibility string to a blocklist to prevent driver conflicts - there are no security implications in the code changes or the underlying issue being addressed.
6907e8093b307 nvmem: rockchip-otp: Move read-offset into variant-data
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of the commit and the Linux kernel tree, here is my assessment: **NO** This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis: 1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a code refactoring commit that moves a hardcoded offset value (`RK3588_NO_SECURE_OFFSET = 0x300`) into a configurable `read_offset` field in the variant data structure. The functional behavior remains exactly the same. 2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: - The commit message describes this as a generalization effort to support multiple chip variants with different offsets - There's no mention of fixing a security issue, buffer overflow, or access control problem - The offset calculation `addr_start += RK3588_NO_SECURE_OFFSET` becomes `addr_start += otp->data->read_offset / RK3588_NBYTES` - mathematically equivalent for RK3588 (0xc00/4 = 0x300) 3. **Code analysis**: - The change simply moves a magic number into variant-specific data structure - No change in memory access patterns, bounds checking, or security controls - The same offset (0xc00 bytes = 0x300 blocks) is still used for RK3588 - This is preparation work for adding RK3576 support (as seen in the subsequent commit) 4. **Pattern comparison**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern of driver improvements/refactoring without security implications, similar to the nvmem commits in the examples. 5. **Historical context**: The git history shows this is part of a series adding support for new chip variants, not fixing existing security vulnerabilities. The `NO_SECURE_OFFSET` name in the original code likely refers to skipping over secure/protected areas of the OTP memory to reach user-accessible areas, which is a normal hardware design pattern, not a security vulnerability.
de76809f60cc9 phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2: Move IRQ request in probe
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a serious security vulnerability that can cause system crashes. **Key Security Issues Fixed:** 1. **Synchronous Abort Prevention**: The commit message explicitly states that the bug causes "synchronous abort" - a serious kernel-level fault that can crash the system when IRQ handlers try to access hardware registers while PHY clocks are inactive. 2. **Denial of Service Vulnerability**: The issue is easily triggerable through: - Normal driver removal operations - Enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ configuration - Power management state transitions 3. **Critical Code Changes**: The IRQ handler now includes essential runtime PM state checking: ```c pm_runtime_get_noresume(dev); if (pm_runtime_suspended(dev)) goto rpm_put; ``` This prevents dangerous hardware register access when the device is suspended. 4. **Pattern Match with Similar CVE-Assigned Commits**: This follows the same pattern as "Similar Commit 4" (CVE: YES) which prevented nullptr exceptions in ISR, and "Similar Commit 3" (CVE: YES) which fixed NULL pointer dereferences leading to crashes. The combination of kernel-level crashes, easy reproducibility, and the serious nature of synchronous aborts makes this a clear security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
55a387ebb9219 phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2: Lock around hardware registers and driver data
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit in detail by examining the changes and understanding the security implications: ## Analysis **NO** This commit fixes concurrency issues and potential race conditions in a PHY driver, but it does **not** constitute a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. ### Key Evidence: 1. **Driver Context**: This is a PHY (Physical Layer) driver for USB2.0 controllers in Renesas R-Car Gen3 SoCs - hardware initialization and configuration code that runs in kernel space. 2. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit addresses synchronization issues by: - Replacing a mutex with a spinlock (`spinlock_t lock`) - Protecting hardware register access and driver data structures - Adding proper locking around IRQ handlers and sysfs operations - Using cleanup.h helpers and scoped guards 3. **Race Conditions Fixed**: - IRQ handler racing with PHY configuration (lines 442-450) - Multiple threads configuring different PHYs simultaneously (lines 464, 492, 519) - sysfs role_store() racing with phy_init()/phy_power_on() (line 352) 4. **Impact Assessment**: The race conditions could lead to: - Hardware misconfiguration - Inconsistent driver state - Potential system instability or USB malfunction - **But NOT privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts** 5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided examples: - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) involved a **data race affecting shared protocol converter registers** between multiple lanes, which could **corrupt hardware configuration values** - This commit has similar technical characteristics but affects **device-specific PHY initialization**, not shared multi-device protocols 6. **Security Relevance**: While this fixes important kernel stability issues, it does not: - Allow privilege escalation - Enable information disclosure - Create attack vectors for malicious code - Affect memory safety boundaries - Impact system security controls The fix prevents hardware configuration corruption and system instability, but these are **reliability/correctness issues** rather than **security vulnerabilities**. The race conditions occur in kernel driver initialization code that requires root privileges to access.
bd00b29b5f236 drm/amd/display: Do not enable replay when vtotal update is pending.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here's my assessment: **NO** This commit does not appear to be fixing a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why: 1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds a synchronization mechanism (`timing_adjust_pending` flag) to prevent replay from being enabled when vertical total (vtotal) timing updates are still pending. This is a timing coordination issue, not a security vulnerability. 2. **Root cause analysis**: The issue is that the hardware's vtotal settings may not be applied immediately during vsync interrupt handling. Enabling replay before vtotal is properly aligned could cause display corruption or improper behavior, but this is a display functionality issue rather than a security concern. 3. **Impact assessment**: The code changes show: - Addition of a `timing_adjust_pending` flag in `dc_crtc_timing_adjust` structure - Logic to set this flag when timing adjustments are being made - Logic to clear this flag when DRR (Dynamic Refresh Rate) settings are applied - The flag serves as a gate to prevent replay enable when timing is not synchronized 4. **No security implications**: - No memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) - No privilege escalation potential - No access control bypass - No information disclosure - No denial of service that affects system security 5. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the provided similar commits (marked CVE Status: NO) deal with display functionality improvements, feature enablement/disablement, and timing coordination - none of which are security-related. This commit follows the same pattern. This is a display driver robustness improvement that ensures proper coordination between different display features (replay and variable refresh rate), but it does not fix a security vulnerability.
874697e127931 drm/amd/display: Defer BW-optimization-blocked DRR adjustments
- [sasha] Let me analyze this without the web fetch. Based on the code changes and commit message, I can now provide a security assessment. ## Security Analysis **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: ### 1. **Functional Fix, Not Security Vulnerability** The code changes address a **functional issue** where display refresh rates would remain incorrect after VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) was disabled by userspace. This is a user experience bug, not a security vulnerability. ### 2. **Improves Robustness, Doesn't Introduce Risk** The changes enhance the existing DRR (Dynamic Refresh Rate) mechanism by: - **Adding deferral logic**: Instead of dropping timing adjustments when bandwidth optimizations are pending, they are now properly deferred - **Checking for pending adjustments**: The `is_dc_timing_adjust_needed()` function now correctly identifies when deferred adjustments need to be applied ### 3. **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Impact** The code changes operate entirely within the display driver's timing management: - No changes to memory management or access controls - No privilege boundary crossings - No user input validation concerns - No network or filesystem interactions ### 4. **Race Condition Prevention, Not Introduction** The original issue was that DRR timing adjustments were being **dropped** during bandwidth optimizations, leading to: - Incorrect display refresh rates persisting - Desynchronization between expected and actual display state The fix **prevents** potential race conditions by properly deferring the adjustments until it's safe to apply them. ### 5. **Consistent with Similar Commits** Looking at the historical similar commits provided, all were marked as "CVE Status: NO" for similar display driver fixes that address functional bugs without security implications. ### 6. **Limited Blast Radius** The changes are confined to: - AMD GPU display driver timing management - DRR/VRR functionality specifically - No system-wide impact or cross-component effects The fix addresses a **quality-of-life issue** for users with variable refresh rate displays, ensuring that when VRR is disabled, the display properly returns to the expected refresh rate instead of remaining stuck at an incorrect rate.
85adf2094abb9 nvmet: pci-epf: clear completion queue IRQ flag on delete
- [sasha] **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE based on my analysis of the code changes and their security implications. **Key Security Issues Fixed:** 1. **Reference Count Underflow**: The original code unconditionally called `nvmet_pci_epf_remove_irq_vector()` which decrements an unsigned integer reference count (`iv->ref--`) without checking if the IRQ vector was actually allocated. For completion queues created without IRQ enabled, `cq->vector` defaults to 0 (from `kcalloc()` zero initialization), and calling remove on an unallocated vector causes integer underflow from 0 to `UINT_MAX`. 2. **Resource Exhaustion DoS**: The underflowed reference count prevents proper cleanup of IRQ vectors since `!iv->ref` will never be true when `ref = UINT_MAX`. This can exhaust the limited IRQ vector pool, causing denial of service where new completion queues cannot be created with IRQ enabled. 3. **State Corruption**: The failure to clear the `NVMET_PCI_EPF_Q_IRQ_ENABLED` flag during deletion creates inconsistent driver state during queue recreation scenarios. **Attack Vector**: An attacker with access to the NVMe target device could repeatedly create and delete completion queues without IRQ enabled to trigger the reference count underflow and eventually exhaust IRQ vector resources. The fix properly addresses these issues by adding a conditional check `if (test_and_clear_bit(NVMET_PCI_EPF_Q_IRQ_ENABLED, &cq->flags))` before calling the remove function, ensuring IRQ vector operations only occur when IRQ is actually enabled and properly clearing the state flag. This represents a clear security vulnerability with denial of service impact through resource exhaustion, warranting CVE assignment.
34935701b7ed1 drm/amd/display: Correct timing_adjust_pending flag setting.
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, I can now provide my assessment: **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning: ## Analysis Summary ### Nature of the Fix The commit corrects a logical bug in the flag state management within the `copy_stream_update_to_stream` function. Specifically: 1. **Before the fix**: The code was setting `stream->adjust.timing_adjust_pending = true` but then immediately overwriting `stream->adjust` with the entire `update->crtc_timing_adjust` structure, potentially losing the flag state. 2. **After the fix**: The code correctly sets `update->crtc_timing_adjust->timing_adjust_pending = true` before copying the structure, then resets the update's flag afterward. ### Why This is NOT a Security Vulnerability 1. **Logic/State Management Bug**: This is fundamentally a state management issue in display driver logic, not a security vulnerability. The flag controls timing adjustment coordination, not security boundaries. 2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The fix doesn't address buffer overflows, memory corruption, use-after-free, or other memory safety vulnerabilities. 3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug doesn't affect access controls, capability checks, or security boundaries between user/kernel space. 4. **Limited Impact Scope**: The issue affects display timing coordination logic, which could cause display artifacts or incorrect refresh rate behavior, but doesn't provide attack vectors for: - Information disclosure - Code execution - Privilege escalation - System compromise 5. **Internal Driver Logic**: This is an internal coordination mechanism within the AMD display driver for managing hardware state transitions, not an interface exposed to potentially malicious input. ### Comparison to Similar Commits Looking at the provided examples of similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO", this commit follows the same pattern: - Driver-internal logic corrections - Flag/state management improvements - No security boundaries affected - Purely functional fixes without security implications ### Conclusion While improper flag handling could theoretically contribute to system instability under specific conditions, this particular fix addresses a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. The commit corrects the logical flow of state management but doesn't address any attack vectors or security boundaries that would warrant CVE assignment.
060fac202eb8e ASoC: codecs: wsa884x: Correct VI sense channel mask
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the comprehensive code examination, I can now provide my security assessment. **NO** This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE for the following reasons: 1. **Nature of the Fix**: The commit corrects a channel mask configuration from `0x3` (2 channels) to `0x1` (1 channel) for the VI sense port. This is a **functional correctness fix**, not a security vulnerability fix. 2. **No Security Impact**: The change affects audio codec configuration and fixes "garbage being recorded" during VI sense feedback testing. This is a **quality/functionality issue**, not a security vulnerability. The VI sense functionality is used for speaker protection monitoring, not security-sensitive data processing. 3. **Similar Pattern**: The provided historical examples show three very similar commits (wsa883x, wsa881x, wsa884x) that all fix the same type of channel mask issue and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the exact same pattern. 4. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The change is a simple constant value correction in a static configuration array. There are no bounds checking issues, buffer overflows, or memory corruption possibilities introduced or fixed by this change. 5. **Limited Scope**: The fix only affects the specific WSA884x audio codec driver in a controlled hardware interface configuration. The "garbage" mentioned refers to incorrect audio data, not security-sensitive information disclosure. While my analysis revealed potential security vulnerabilities in the broader WSA884x driver code (missing bounds validation in port control functions), this specific commit does not address those issues - it only corrects an audio configuration parameter to match the hardware specification.
50d75a13a9ce8 nvmem: rockchip-otp: add rk3576 variant data
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit changes in detail: **Analysis:** This commit adds support for the RK3576 variant to the Rockchip OTP (One-Time Programmable) NVMEM driver. Let me examine the changes: 1. **Code Changes Analysis:** - Adds a new `rk3576_data` structure with size `0x100` and read_offset `0x700` - Reuses existing clock configuration (`px30_otp_clocks`) and read function (`rk3588_otp_read`) - Adds a new device tree compatibility string `"rockchip,rk3576-otp"` 2. **Security Implications Assessment:** - This is purely a **new hardware variant addition**, not a bug fix - No changes to existing security-sensitive logic (access controls, validation, etc.) - No changes to memory bounds checking or buffer handling - No changes to authentication or authorization mechanisms - The commit message explicitly states it's adding support for a new variant that "works very similar to the rk3588" 3. **Pattern Comparison with Similar Commits:** - Looking at the provided examples, all similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" were either: - Configuration additions (like setting `add_legacy_fixed_of_cells`) - Format validation fixes (like checking 32 bpp format) - Code refactoring (using nvmem subsystem helpers) - Hardware-specific workarounds for non-security issues 4. **No Security Vulnerability Indicators:** - No "Fixes:" tag indicating a security bug - No mention of vulnerabilities, exploits, or security concerns - No changes to existing bounds checking or validation logic - Simply adds new hardware parameters (size, offset) for a new chip variant **NO** This commit adds support for a new hardware variant (RK3576) by defining new chip-specific parameters (size: 0x100, read_offset: 0x700) and reusing existing, proven code paths. It contains no security fixes, vulnerability patches, or changes to security-sensitive logic. It's a straightforward hardware enablement patch that follows the established pattern for adding new Rockchip OTP variants.
f591cf9fce724 vhost-scsi: protect vq->log_used with vq->mutex
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the vulnerability. Let me analyze the security implications: **YES** This commit should be assigned a CVE as it fixes a serious race condition that can lead to **use-after-free** vulnerability with security implications. **Analysis:** 1. **The Race Condition**: The commit message clearly describes a race between the vhost completion path and QEMU's VHOST_SET_VRING_ADDR ioctl: - vhost completion thread checks `vq->log_used` outside of mutex protection - QEMU thread can disable `vq->log_used` via VHOST_SET_VRING_ADDR while holding `vq->mutex` - QEMU can then free `vq->log_base` memory - vhost completion thread continues to access the freed `vq->log_base` 2. **Security Impact**: - This is a **use-after-free vulnerability** where kernel code writes to freed userspace memory - The vulnerability affects memory safety and can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation - It's triggerable from a guest VM, making it a guest-to-host escape vulnerability - The bug occurs in critical kernel virtualization infrastructure (vhost) 3. **Code Changes Analysis**: - The fix adds `mutex_lock(&svq->vq.mutex)` protection around the entire completion work function in `vhost_scsi_complete_cmd_work()` - Similarly adds mutex protection in `vhost_scsi_tmf_resp_work()` - This prevents the race by ensuring `vq->log_used` and `vq->log_base` cannot be modified while completion work is accessing them 4. **Similar Patterns**: Looking at similar commits marked as CVE-worthy: - Similar Commit 2 and 4 both received CVEs for null pointer dereference issues in vhost/scsi - This vulnerability has comparable or greater impact as it involves use-after-free rather than just null pointer dereference The fix addresses a memory safety vulnerability in virtualization infrastructure that could potentially be exploited by malicious guests, making it clearly CVE-worthy.
