9c7632faad434 drm/xe/lrc: Use a temporary buffer for WA BB
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  ## Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a correctness fix for a programming error, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit addresses the improper handling of I/O memory (iomem) by using a temporary buffer when writing to it, which is a standard kernel practice for proper hardware interaction.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The code change doesn't fix any security boundary violations. It's fixing the technical issue of writing directly to I/O memory which could cause:
     - Hardware malfunction due to improper access patterns
     - Potential system instability
     - Driver crashes
  3. **No exploitable vulnerability**: The original code (writing directly to iomem) doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability that could lead to:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service attacks by unprivileged users
     - Memory corruption exploitable by attackers
  4. **Standard kernel practice**: Using temporary buffers for I/O memory writes is a common pattern in kernel drivers to ensure proper memory access semantics and hardware compatibility. This is more about following correct programming practices than fixing a security issue.
  5. **Limited impact scope**: The fix is isolated to the xe GPU driver's workaround batch buffer handling, which is already in a privileged context. An attacker would need existing privileged access to potentially cause issues with the original code.
  Similar to the reference commits provided, this appears to be a bug fix for proper functionality rather than a security vulnerability fix. While improper I/O memory handling could theoretically lead to system instability, there's no indication that this creates an exploitable security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
d78ebc772c7ce net: ethtool: Don't check if RSS context exists in case of context 0
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel code, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It's a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a regression where creating flow steering rules for RSS context 0 (the default context) was incorrectly failing. This is a usability issue, not a security issue.
  2. **No security boundary is crossed**: The bug causes legitimate operations to fail with -EINVAL. It doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or any security policy bypass.
  3. **The impact is denial of functionality, not a security impact**: Users cannot create flow steering rules for context 0, which prevents them from using a legitimate feature. This doesn't expose the system to attacks or compromise security.
  4. **The code change is minimal and safe**: The fix simply adds a check `if (info.rss_context &&` before the xa_load check, recognizing that context 0 is the default context that always exists and doesn't need to be stored in the xarray.
  5. **Similar commits show this pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked as CVE Status: NO), they all deal with RSS/ethtool functionality fixes that improve correctness but don't address security vulnerabilities.
  The commit message explicitly states this is fixing a "user-visible regression" where legitimate ethtool commands were failing. This is a quality/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
1264971017b4d net: drv: netdevsim: don't napi_complete() from netpoll
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue! When netpoll calls `poll_one_napi()`, it:
  1. Sets NAPI_STATE_NPSVC bit (line 157)
  2. Calls napi->poll with budget = 0 (line 163)
  3. This causes nsim_poll() to be called with budget=0
  In the original code, `nsim_poll()` was calling `napi_complete()` unconditionally, which eventually calls `napi_complete_done()`. However, this function expects NAPIF_STATE_SCHED to be set, which won't be set in the netpoll context because netpoll doesn't go through the normal NAPI scheduling path.
  The fix changes the code to only call `napi_complete_done()` when `done < budget`, which means it won't be called when budget=0 (the netpoll case).
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a warning condition, it does not represent a security vulnerability. The issue is:
  1. **Not a security bug**: The warning indicates incorrect API usage (calling `napi_complete()` from netpoll context), but this doesn't create any security vulnerability. It's a programming error that triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE.
  2. **No security impact**: The incorrect call to `napi_complete()` in netpoll context doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, denial of service, or any other security issue. It just triggers a warning message.
  3. **Limited scope**: This only affects the netdevsim driver, which is a simulated network device used primarily for testing and development, not production systems.
  4. **No exploitability**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this issue to gain unauthorized access or cause harm to the system.
  The similar commits marked as CVE=YES dealt with actual security issues like deadlocks that could be triggered maliciously or memory/state corruption issues. This commit merely fixes a harmless warning about incorrect API usage in a test driver.
d92adacdd8c29 net_sched: ets: fix a race in ets_qdisc_change()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Race Condition Leading to Security Impact**: The commit describes a race condition where the SFQ perturb timer can fire between `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` and `qdisc_put()`, causing a parent qdisc's queue length (`qlen`) to underflow. An underflowed qlen is a serious issue as it can lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Use-after-free conditions
     - System instability
  2. **Similar to Previous CVE-assigned Commits**: This issue follows similar patterns to other CVE-assigned commits in the reference list:
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) - Fixed qlen ordering issues with `qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()`
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed ordering of qlen adjustments to prevent notification failures
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a UAF vulnerability in HFSC class handling
  3. **The Fix Pattern**: The change from `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` to `qdisc_purge_queue()` is security-critical because:
     - `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` only adjusts counters without actually removing packets
     - `qdisc_purge_queue()` calls `qdisc_reset()` first to purge all packets before adjusting counters
     - This ensures packets are removed while holding the lock, preventing the race window
  4. **Exploitability**: The commit explicitly mentions "This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen", indicating that attackers could potentially trigger this condition to cause system instability or crashes.
  5. **Component Sensitivity**: Network packet schedulers are critical kernel components that handle network traffic. Vulnerabilities in these components can affect system availability and potentially be exploited remotely through crafted network traffic patterns.
  The race condition allows for queue length underflow which is a security vulnerability that can lead to memory corruption or system crashes, making it worthy of CVE assignment.
43eb466041216 net_sched: tbf: fix a race in tbf_change()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: While this is a race condition that can cause a parent qdisc's queue length (qlen) to underflow, the security impact is minimal. The commit message states "This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen" but this is primarily a correctness/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **Code analysis**: The fix changes `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` to `qdisc_purge_queue()`. The key difference is:
     - `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()`: Only updates backlog statistics without actually resetting/purging packets
     - `qdisc_purge_queue()`: Calls `qdisc_reset()` (which purges all packets) before updating statistics, all while holding the lock
  3. **Impact assessment**: The underflow of qlen is a statistics/accounting error that affects queue management but doesn't lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation  
     - System crashes
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond potential qdisc misbehavior
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Simple data race annotation fix - no security impact
     - Similar Commit 2 & 3 (YES CVE): Use-After-Free vulnerability - clear security impact with potential for memory corruption
     - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Backlog statistics accounting fix - similar to this commit
     - Similar Commit 5 (YES CVE): Another UAF vulnerability
  This commit fixes a race condition that causes incorrect statistics/accounting rather than a exploitable security vulnerability. The race involves timing between `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` and SFQ perturb timer operations, but the impact is limited to incorrect queue length values rather than memory safety issues.
85a3e0ede3845 net_sched: red: fix a race in __red_change()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, examining both the commit message and code changes:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Clear Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a race condition that leads to **qlen underflow** in the parent qdisc. As stated in the commit message: "This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen."
  2. **Exploitable Impact**: The qlen underflow is a security issue because:
     - It causes an integer underflow (wrapping to ~4 billion)
     - This underflowed value can be used as an array index or size parameter
     - Can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing kernel crashes or memory corruption
  3. **Attack Vector**: The race requires:
     - Local access with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
     - Ability to configure traffic control (RED qdisc replacement)
     - Timing the SFQ perturb timer to fire during the vulnerable window
  4. **Root Cause**: The vulnerability was introduced by commit 0c8d13ac9607 which moved `qdisc_put()` outside the lock, creating a window where:
     - CPU 0 calls `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` but doesn't actually remove packets
     - CPU 0 releases the lock
     - CPU 1 (SFQ timer) modifies the child qdisc and calls `qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()`
     - This double-reduction causes the parent's qlen to underflow
  5. **Fix Pattern**: The change from `qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()` to `qdisc_purge_queue()` ensures all packets are actually removed while holding the lock, preventing the race.
  6. **Similar CVEs**: The commit history shows similar race conditions in traffic control have been assigned CVEs (e.g., the referenced similar commits with "CVE Status: YES" show comparable qlen/backlog ordering issues).
  This represents a legitimate security vulnerability with potential for denial of service and possibly more severe impacts if combined with other exploitation techniques.
d35acc1be3480 net_sched: prio: fix a race in prio_tune()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it with similar commits that were assigned CVEs, I believe this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a race condition in the PRIO scheduler that can be abused to underflow a parent qdisc's queue length counter. The security implications are significant:
  1. **Exploitable vulnerability**: The commit explicitly states "This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen", indicating it's not just a theoretical bug but an exploitable issue.
  2. **Integer underflow**: When qlen (an unsigned integer) underflows, it wraps to a very large value, potentially causing:
     - Memory corruption through buffer overflows
     - Denial of Service through resource exhaustion
     - Kernel crashes (similar to the HTB crashes mentioned in related CVE commits)
  3. **Kernel-level impact**: This affects the Linux kernel's network traffic control subsystem, which runs in kernel space with high privileges.
  4. **Similar CVEs**: Commits 2-5 in the reference list, which also deal with qlen ordering issues and potential crashes, were all assigned CVEs. This commit has similar characteristics.
  5. **Race condition**: The vulnerability involves a race between CPUs that allows double-accounting of packets, leading to the underflow. Race conditions in kernel code are particularly dangerous as they can be exploited for privilege escalation.
  The fix properly eliminates the race by using `qdisc_purge_queue()` which atomically removes all packets before updating parent counters, preventing the double-accounting that causes the underflow.
d4e6cb324dcc9 net: phy: phy_caps: Don't skip better duplex macth on non-exact match
- [sasha] Now let me trace through the bug to understand the security implications. Looking at the original code:
  **Original buggy code:**
  ```c
  if (lcap->speed == speed && lcap->duplex == duplex) {
      return lcap;
  } else if (!exact) {
      if (lcap->speed <= speed)
          return lcap;  // This returns too early!
  }
  ```
  **Fixed code:**
  ```c
  if (lcap->speed == speed && lcap->duplex == duplex) {
      return lcap;
  } else if (!exact) {
      if (!match && lcap->speed <= speed)
          match = lcap;  // Just remember the match, don't return yet
      
      if (lcap->speed < speed)
          break;  // Only stop when speed is definitely lower
  }
  ```
  **NO**
  This is a functional bug fix in the PHY (Physical Layer) capability matching logic, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when performing a non-exact lookup for network interface speed/duplex settings, the code would return a full-duplex match too early when the caller requested half-duplex, without checking if a better half-duplex match existed.
  The bug only affects the selection of network interface duplex mode (full-duplex vs half-duplex) when auto-negotiation is disabled. This could result in selecting a less optimal duplex mode, but it does not:
  - Allow unauthorized access
  - Cause memory corruption
  - Lead to privilege escalation
  - Create denial of service conditions
  - Expose sensitive information
  The worst case scenario is that the network interface operates in full-duplex mode when half-duplex was requested, which is a functional issue that might cause some packet collisions or performance degradation, but is not a security vulnerability.
875d7c160d606 net/mlx5e: Fix number of lanes to UNKNOWN when using data_rate_oper
- [sasha] This shows how lanes is used in line 1172: if `info->lanes` is non-zero, it must match the table entry's lanes for that link mode to be selected.
  Based on my comprehensive analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The issue is a functional bug in the mlx5 network driver where the number of lanes is incorrectly reported as MAX_LANES (8) instead of LANES_UNKNOWN (0) when the link protocol information is not available from firmware but speed can be obtained from data_rate_oper.
  The bug has the following characteristics:
  1. **No security impact**: The lanes value is used only for ethtool reporting and link mode selection, not for any security-sensitive operations
  2. **Limited scope**: Only affects reporting accuracy when using non-standard cables where firmware doesn't report protocol details
  3. **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory corruption
  4. **No privilege escalation**: Doesn't allow unauthorized access or privilege changes
  5. **Informational only**: The primary impact is incorrect information displayed to users about link configuration
  This is similar to the reference commits provided which also fix link mode mapping issues without CVE assignment. The fix simply corrects the behavior to properly indicate "unknown" lanes rather than falsely reporting 8 lanes.
aa9c44b842096 net/mlx5e: Fix leak of Geneve TLV option object
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, I can now make a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a resource leak of a Geneve TLV option object, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a memory/resource leak where a reference-counted object (`mlx5_geneve_tlv_option`) is not properly released.
  2. **Code analysis shows**:
     - In `parse_tunnel_attr()` (lines 2564-2586), a temporary `mlx5_flow_spec` is created
     - `mlx5e_tc_tun_parse()` is called, which can create a Geneve TLV option object via `mlx5_geneve_tlv_option_add()` (seen in line 254 of tc_tun_geneve.c)
     - The temporary spec is freed without calling `mlx5_geneve_tlv_option_del()` to release the TLV option
     - The fix adds a check for `mlx5_flow_has_geneve_opt()` and calls `mlx5_geneve_tlv_option_del()` before freeing the temporary spec
  3. **Impact assessment**:
     - This is a reference count leak - the `refcount` field in `struct mlx5_geneve` is incremented but never decremented
     - The leaked resource is a driver-internal object used for hardware offload of Geneve tunnel options
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - The impact is limited to gradual resource exhaustion over time
  4. **Similar commits**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) also deal with driver fixes for packet processing, memory leaks, and feature corrections - none of which were assigned CVEs.
  This is a quality/reliability bug fix for a resource leak in the network driver's tunnel offload functionality, not a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
b8335829518ec net/mlx5: HWS, make sure the uplink is the last destination
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The code changes show a simple reordering fix where the wire (uplink) destination is moved to the end of the destination array to satisfy a firmware requirement:
  ```c
  +	if (last_dest_idx != -1)
  +		swap(dest_list[last_dest_idx], dest_list[num_dest - 1]);
  ```
  Key reasons this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Controlled failure mode**: The commit message explicitly states that when the ordering is incorrect, "the operation fails with FW syndrome" - this is a graceful, predictable failure, not a crash or undefined behavior.
  2. **No memory safety issues**: The fix is just swapping array elements using the standard `swap()` macro. There's no buffer overflow, use-after-free, or memory corruption.
  3. **Limited scope**: This only affects multi-destination flow configurations in the mlx5 HWS (Hardware Steering) subsystem, which requires administrative privileges to configure.
  4. **No exploitability**: An attacker cannot leverage this to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause system instability. The worst case is that certain flow configurations fail to be applied.
  5. **Functional bug**: This is a violation of firmware API requirements that prevents certain configurations from working correctly, not a security boundary violation.
  The similar commits provided (commits 1-3) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with similar functional issues in the mlx5 driver. This commit follows the same pattern of fixing configuration/API compliance issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
b5e3c76f35ee7 net/mlx5: HWS, fix missing ip_version handling in definer
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Non-security bug fix**: The commit fixes a missing field handling in the definer for outer IP version. Looking at the code, the inner headers already had IP_VERSION_I handling (lines 717-719), but the outer headers were missing the equivalent IP_VERSION_O handling. This is a functional completeness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The missing IP_VERSION_O field handling would prevent proper matching on the outer IP version field in packet steering rules. This could cause incorrect packet matching/filtering but doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
  3. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This fix is similar to the other commits shown that were marked "CVE Status: NO". They all involve fixing field handling, structure layout, or memory management in the HWS (Hardware Steering) subsystem without security implications.
  4. **Functional correctness fix**: The change simply adds the missing `HWS_SET_HDR` call for IP_VERSION_O that was already present for the inner headers (IP_VERSION_I). This ensures feature parity between inner and outer header processing.
  The only commit in the examples that received a CVE (commit 3) was fixing a negative bit offset issue that could cause undefined behavior with shift operations, which has potential security implications. This commit does not have similar characteristics.
8ec40e3f1f72b net/mlx5: Fix return value when searching for existing flow group
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit without accessing the full file context.
  **Analysis of the commit:**
  The commit message describes:
  - When attempting to add a rule to an existing flow group
  - If a matching flow group exists but is not active
  - The error code returned should be EAGAIN (instead of ENOENT)
  - This allows the rule to be added once the group becomes active
  Looking at the code changes:
  1. A new boolean variable `try_again` is introduced
  2. When a flow group is found but not active (`!g->node.active`), it now sets `try_again = true`
  3. The final error return is changed from always returning `ERR_PTR(-ENOENT)` to returning either `-EAGAIN` or `-ENOENT` based on the `try_again` flag
  This is a logic fix that changes the error code returned when encountering inactive flow groups. The impact is:
  - Before: Would return ENOENT (no entity found) even when an inactive matching group exists
  - After: Returns EAGAIN (try again) when an inactive matching group exists
  **Security Assessment:**
  This is NOT a security vulnerability because:
  1. **No privilege escalation**: The change only affects error codes returned, not access control
  2. **No memory safety issues**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory leaks
  3. **No information disclosure**: The error codes don't reveal sensitive information
  4. **No denial of service**: The change doesn't introduce any crash or resource exhaustion
  5. **Functional correctness only**: This is purely a logic fix to return the correct error code for better retry behavior
  The commit is similar to the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" - it's a refactoring/correctness fix that improves the code's behavior but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a functional correctness fix that changes error code semantics to properly indicate when a retry might succeed (EAGAIN) versus when no matching entity exists (ENOENT). There are no security implications - no memory safety issues, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure, and no denial of service potential.
687560d8a9a2d net/mlx5: Fix ECVF vports unload on shutdown flow
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I'll provide my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free (UAF) Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in the kernel, as evidenced by the kernel warning "refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free" in the call trace.
  2. **Security Impact**: The UAF occurs during shutdown flow when ECVF (Embedded Chip Virtual Function) vports are being unloaded on BlueField devices. Use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - System crashes (DoS)
     - Potential privilege escalation or code execution
  3. **Root Cause**: The bug was introduced by incorrectly passing `esw->esw_funcs.num_vfs` instead of `esw->esw_funcs.num_ec_vfs` when unloading EC VF vports:
     ```c
     // Buggy code:
     mlx5_eswitch_unload_ec_vf_vports(esw, esw->esw_funcs.num_vfs);
     
     // Fixed code:
     mlx5_eswitch_unload_ec_vf_vports(esw, esw->esw_funcs.num_ec_vfs);
     ```
  4. **Memory Management Issue**: The incorrect parameter caused the wrong number of vports to be unloaded, leading to incomplete cleanup of ACL ingress tables. This resulted in accessing already-freed memory structures when the flow table was being destroyed.
  5. **Similar CVE Patterns**: The similar commits show that UAF vulnerabilities in the mlx5 driver involving vport management and cleanup paths have been assigned CVEs in the past (Similar Commits 1, 2, and 4 all received CVEs for UAF conditions).
  The vulnerability affects systems using Mellanox BlueField devices with EC VF functionality enabled, and can be triggered during system shutdown or when disabling SRIOV functionality.
f37258133c1e9 net/mlx5: Ensure fw pages are always allocated on same NUMA
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture of the issue. Let me analyze this for CVE assignment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: The issue is a NUMA node allocation inconsistency, not a security vulnerability. The commit ensures firmware pages are allocated from the same NUMA node as originally intended.
  2. **Performance/Correctness Issue**: The problem is that `dev_to_node()` can return different NUMA nodes after `mlx5_dma_zalloc_coherent_node()` temporarily changes the device's NUMA node (via `set_dev_node()`). This leads to firmware pages being allocated on different NUMA nodes, which affects memory locality and performance, not security.
  3. **No Security Impact**: The code change simply replaces `dev_to_node(device)` with `dev->priv.numa_node` to ensure consistent NUMA allocation. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Information disclosure
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Input validation failure
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the other NUMA-related commits in the examples (commits 1 and 4) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". They deal with DMA synchronization and memory allocation optimizations for performance.
  The commit fixes a functional issue where firmware pages could be allocated on different NUMA nodes than intended, affecting memory locality and potentially performance, but this does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
7dd38ba4acbea Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix sparse errors
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is purely a sparse static analysis warning fix for type mismatch. The commit changes the function parameter from `u16 handle` to `__le16 handle` and removes the `cpu_to_le16()` conversion inside the function.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The code changes show this is fixing a compiler/static analyzer warning about inconsistent endianness annotations. The sparse tool detected that `mgmt_adv_monitor_removed()` was being called with a `__le16` type (from `cp->monitor_handle`) but the function expected a `u16`.
  3. **No functional change**: The actual behavior of the code remains identical:
     - Before: Function takes `u16`, converts it to `__le16` with `cpu_to_le16()`
     - After: Function takes `__le16` directly, no conversion needed
     
  4. **Context from similar commits**: The similar commits shown (CVE Status: YES) all fix actual security vulnerabilities like:
     - NULL pointer dereferences (missing NULL checks after memory allocation)
     - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
     
     This commit doesn't fix any such vulnerability - it's just cleaning up type annotations.
  5. **The referenced UAF fix**: While this commit references fixing a UAF (Use-After-Free) issue in commit e6ed54e86aae, the current commit itself is not fixing the UAF - it's just cleaning up a sparse warning that was introduced by that UAF fix.
  This is a code quality/cleanup commit that addresses static analysis warnings, not a security fix.
47c03902269af Bluetooth: eir: Fix possible crashes on eir_create_adv_data
- [sasha] So `eir_precalc_len(1)` returns 3 bytes (2 bytes for type/length + 1 byte for data).
  Now let me analyze the vulnerability:
  1. **Buffer Overflow Risk**: Without bounds checking, the function could write beyond the allocated buffer when adding EIR_FLAGS (3 bytes) or EIR_TX_POWER (3 bytes).
  2. **Buffer Sizes**: 
     - For extended advertising: HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH (buffer is allocated with DEFINE_FLEX)
     - For legacy advertising: HCI_MAX_AD_LENGTH = 31 bytes
  3. **Security Impact**: This could lead to memory corruption and potential crashes when:
     - The advertising data is already near the maximum size
     - Both EIR_FLAGS and EIR_TX_POWER need to be added (6 bytes total)
     - The function writes beyond the allocated buffer
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Bluetooth EIR (Extended Inquiry Response) advertising data creation function. The vulnerability occurs when `eir_create_adv_data()` attempts to add EIR_FLAGS (3 bytes) and/or EIR_TX_POWER (3 bytes) without checking if there's sufficient space in the destination buffer. This can lead to memory corruption and crashes when the advertising data is near its maximum size (31 bytes for legacy advertising). The fix adds proper bounds checking before writing these fields, preventing potential buffer overflows that could be triggered by crafted advertising data configurations.
5725bc6082520 Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix broadcast/PA when using an existing instance
- [sasha] Looking at the changes and analyzing the issue:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit addresses an issue where existing advertising data was being overwritten when reusing an existing advertising instance for broadcast sources.
  2. **Buffer handling**: While the change does modify buffer sizes (from `ad[4 + 3]` to `ad[HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH]`), this is not fixing a buffer overflow vulnerability. The original code was using a fixed small buffer that was adequate for its specific purpose (just storing the Broadcast ID announcement).
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - The fix properly handles existing data by appending rather than overwriting
     - It converts existing instances to periodic advertising when needed
     - The buffer size increase is to accommodate both the new Broadcast ID and the existing advertising data
  4. **Security impact**: There is no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption possibilities
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote code execution
     - Access control bypass
  5. **Functional impact**: This is purely a functional fix to ensure that when reusing an existing advertising instance, the original advertising data is preserved rather than being completely overwritten.
  The commit is fixing a legitimate functional bug in the Bluetooth stack's handling of periodic advertising instances, but it does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
20a2aa01f5aeb Bluetooth: Fix NULL pointer deference on eir_get_service_data
- [sasha] So the function was introduced by commit 8f9ae5b3ae80, which is mentioned in the Fixes tag.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The code has a clear NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. When `eir_get_service_data()` is called with `len=NULL` (which is documented as optional), the original code still attempts to dereference `len` at lines 378-379 (`eir += *len; eir_len -= *len;`).
  2. **Real-world Impact**: The vulnerability is actively used in the kernel - I found actual call sites in `hci_sync.c` that pass NULL for the `len` parameter (lines 1574-1575 and 1582-1583).
  3. **Kernel Crash Potential**: A NULL pointer dereference in kernel space typically leads to a kernel panic/crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
  4. **Similar Pattern to CVE-assigned Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown which were assigned CVEs - they all fix NULL pointer dereferences in the Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to kernel crashes.
  5. **Security-relevant Component**: The Bluetooth subsystem handles external input from potentially untrusted devices, making vulnerabilities in this code particularly security-sensitive.
  The fix properly handles the optional `len` parameter by using a local variable `dlen` for the loop iteration, only updating `*len` when it's non-NULL.
260388f79e94f net/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds clause 45 read/write access
- [sasha] Now I have enough information to make a determination. Let me analyze the vulnerability:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Vulnerability - Out-of-bounds Array Access**: The code shows a clear out-of-bounds array access vulnerability in `__mdiobus_c45_read()` and `__mdiobus_c45_write()` functions. Without the address validation, when `addr >= PHY_MAX_ADDR` (32), the line `mdiobus_stats_acct(&bus->stats[addr], ...)` would access memory beyond the bounds of the `stats[PHY_MAX_ADDR]` array.
  2. **Attack Vector - User-controlled Input**: The commit message explicitly states that "publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools'" can trigger this vulnerability through ioctl calls. The `addr` parameter comes directly from user-space via the SIOCGMIIREG/SIOCSMIIREG ioctl without validation, allowing an attacker to pass any value.
  3. **Memory Safety Impact**: This is a classic out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability that could lead to:
     - Information disclosure (reading adjacent memory)
     - Memory corruption (writing to adjacent memory)
     - Potential privilege escalation or system instability
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: 
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed out-of-bounds access to `mdio_map` array
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed undefined behavior that could lead to security issues
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: YES) - Fixed off-by-one error leading to out-of-bounds access
  5. **No Validation in C22 Path**: Notably, the regular (non-C45) `__mdiobus_read()` function does NOT have this address validation, suggesting it may have the same vulnerability. This indicates a systemic issue that was only partially addressed in this commit.
  The fix properly adds bounds checking (`if (addr >= PHY_MAX_ADDR) return -ENXIO;`) before the array access, preventing the out-of-bounds vulnerability.
0e629694126ca net/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds read/write access
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code context, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Out-of-bounds array access vulnerability**: The commit fixes a security vulnerability where user-controlled input (`addr` parameter) is used directly as an array index into `bus->stats[addr]` without bounds checking. Since `stats` is an array of size `PHY_MAX_ADDR` (32), any address value >= 32 causes out-of-bounds access.
  2. **User-controllable attack vector**: The vulnerability can be triggered through ioctl commands (SIOCGMIIREG/SIOCSMIIREG) that accept arbitrary PHY addresses from userspace. The commit message specifically mentions "publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools'" can trigger this.
  3. **Memory corruption potential**: The out-of-bounds access occurs in `mdiobus_stats_acct(&bus->stats[addr], ...)` which performs both reads and writes to the stats structure, potentially corrupting adjacent kernel memory.
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 1 which validates array bounds before access and was assigned a CVE. The vulnerability allows reading/writing beyond allocated memory boundaries.
  5. **Security impact**: The commit message explicitly mentions this "improves security of read/write operation" and the fix adds bounds checking (`if (addr >= PHY_MAX_ADDR) return -ENXIO;`) before the vulnerable array access.
  The fix properly validates that `addr < PHY_MAX_ADDR` before allowing the operation to proceed, preventing the out-of-bounds access to the stats array.
d9816ec74e6d6 macsec: MACsec SCI assignment for ES = 0
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional correctness issue where legitimate MACsec frames are incorrectly dropped when ES=0 (using bridges/switches) due to incorrect SCI derivation. While this causes a denial of service for legitimate traffic, it does not:
  1. Allow bypassing MACsec encryption/authentication
  2. Cause system crashes or memory corruption 
  3. Lead to information disclosure
  4. Enable privilege escalation
  The fix changes `macsec_frame_sci()` to properly use the active RX SC's SCI when ES=0 and SC=0 instead of deriving it from the MAC address. This is similar to other MACsec functional fixes (like Similar Commits 1, 3, 4, 5) that were not assigned CVEs. Only the NULL dereference issue (Similar Commit 2) that could crash the system received a CVE, which aligns with typical CVE assignment practices where availability issues require actual system crashes rather than just dropped packets.
c85bf1975108d netconsole: fix appending sysdata when sysdata_fields == SYSDATA_RELEASE
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The bug is a functional issue where the SYSDATA_RELEASE feature would not be appended to netconsole messages when it was the only feature enabled. This is because the check at line 1263 only tested for `SYSDATA_CPU_NR | SYSDATA_TASKNAME` but not `SYSDATA_RELEASE`.
  2. **No Security Impact**: 
     - The bug causes missing diagnostic information (kernel release version) in netconsole output
     - It does not expose sensitive information, cause crashes, enable privilege escalation, or create any attack vector
     - The worst outcome is incomplete logging data when only SYSDATA_RELEASE is enabled
  3. **Limited Scope**: 
     - The issue only affects configurations where SYSDATA_RELEASE is the sole enabled sysdata field
     - Netconsole is a debugging/logging facility, not a security-critical component
     - The fix simply changes the condition from checking specific flags to checking if any flags are set (`!nt->sysdata_fields`)
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involve:
     - Buffer boundary issues that could lead to crashes or memory corruption
     - Warning conditions that indicate potential system instability
     - Input validation problems
  This commit is purely a logic fix for a feature that wasn't working correctly in a specific configuration, with no security implications.
2660a544fdc09 net: Fix TOCTOU issue in sk_is_readable()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  This is a clear security vulnerability - a Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and likely kernel crash. Here's why:
  1. **The vulnerability mechanism**: When a socket is in a sockmap, `sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable` is a valid function pointer. When the socket is removed from the sockmap (via `sk_psock_put()`), the `sk->sk_prot` gets restored to its original value where `sock_is_readable` is NULL.
  2. **The race condition**: In the original code:
     ```c
     if (sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable)
         return sk->sk_prot->sock_is_readable(sk);
     ```
     Between checking if `sock_is_readable` is non-NULL and actually calling it, another thread could remove the socket from the sockmap, causing `sk->sk_prot` to be replaced and `sock_is_readable` to become NULL.
  3. **Impact**: This would cause a NULL pointer dereference when trying to call the function, leading to a kernel crash (denial of service).
  4. **Exploitability**: The race window exists in a commonly used code path (`tcp_poll()` → `tcp_stream_is_readable()` → `sk_is_readable()`), making it potentially exploitable by an attacker who can control socket operations and sockmap manipulation.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown which also fixed NULL pointer dereferences in socket/sockmap code paths and were assigned CVEs.
  The fix properly addresses this by using `READ_ONCE()` to ensure the `sk->sk_prot` value is read only once and cached, preventing the TOCTOU race condition.
15eece6c5b05e ACPI: CPPC: Fix NULL pointer dereference when nosmp is used
- [sasha] Now, let me review what the actual commit is fixing. Based on the changes and commit message:
  1. The commit changes `for_each_possible_cpu` to `for_each_present_cpu` in the `cppc_allow_fast_switch()` function
  2. The commit message mentions "With nosmp in cmdline, other CPUs are not brought up, leaving their cpc_desc_ptr NULL"
  3. This causes a NULL pointer dereference when CPU0 iterates through all possible CPUs
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can cause a kernel panic. Here's why it should be assigned a CVE:
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference at address 0x00000000000000b8 (offset into the NULL struct), leading to a kernel panic and system crash. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
  2. **Triggerable Condition**: The vulnerability can be triggered by using the "nosmp" kernel command line parameter, which is a legitimate configuration option. When nosmp is used:
     - Only CPU0 is brought up
     - Other CPUs' `cpc_desc_ptr` remain NULL
     - But `for_each_possible_cpu` still iterates over all CPUs that the hardware could potentially have
     - This causes the NULL pointer dereference when accessing `cpc_ptr->cpc_regs[DESIRED_PERF]`
  3. **Code Pattern Match**: This matches the pattern of similar CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples:
     - Direct NULL pointer dereference without checking if pointer is NULL
     - Can cause kernel panic/crash
     - Similar to CVE examples where functions like `cpufreq_cpu_get_raw()` return NULL and the code doesn't check before dereferencing
  4. **Fix Analysis**: The fix changes from `for_each_possible_cpu` to `for_each_present_cpu`, which only iterates over CPUs that are actually initialized and present in the system. This prevents accessing uninitialized CPU data structures.
  The vulnerability allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) through a specific boot configuration, making it worthy of CVE assignment.
b4a8085ceefb7 e1000: Move cancel_work_sync to avoid deadlock
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a deadlock vulnerability in the e1000 network driver that can lead to a denial of service (system hang). The vulnerability occurs due to an AB-BA deadlock between the RTNL lock and cancel_work_sync():
  1. **Security Impact**: The deadlock causes a complete system hang when closing the network interface (e.g., via `ifconfig eth0 down`), requiring a system reboot.
  2. **Root Cause**: The code path `e1000_close → e1000_down → e1000_down_and_stop → cancel_work_sync` waits for the reset_task while holding RTNL, but reset_task itself tries to acquire RTNL via `rtnl_lock()`.
  3. **Exploitability**: This was discovered by syzbot and can be triggered by unprivileged users who can manipulate network interface states, making it a practical DoS vector.
  4. **Similar CVEs**: The pattern matches other kernel commits that received CVEs for similar deadlock issues (commits 1, 4, and 5 in the reference list), particularly those involving work queue synchronization and lock ordering problems.
  The fix correctly moves the `cancel_work_sync()` call from `e1000_down_and_stop()` to `e1000_remove()`, preventing the deadlock during normal interface operations while still ensuring proper cleanup during device removal.
a5a441ae283d5 ice/ptp: fix crosstimestamp reporting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that corrects timestamp reporting units. The commit adds `system->use_nsecs = true;` to indicate that the timestamp is in nanoseconds, fixing an incorrect timestamp window calculation.
  2. **Impact is limited to functionality**: The issue causes `phc2sys` (a PTP synchronization tool) to fail with "Invalid argument" error. This is a functional failure, not a security vulnerability. The error message in the commit shows: `phc2sys[1768.256]: ioctl PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE: Invalid argument`
  3. **No security boundaries crossed**: The code changes show this is purely about unit conversion in timestamp reporting. The `use_nsecs` field tells the timekeeping subsystem whether the cycles value is in nanoseconds or raw cycles, affecting how the conversion is performed.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (ice: fix PHY timestamp extraction) - NO CVE - fixes incorrect bit field extraction
     - Commit 2 (ice: Fix ETH56G FC-FEC Rx offset value) - NO CVE - fixes incorrect offset calculation
     - This commit is similar in nature - fixing incorrect unit specification
  5. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The bug doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or exposure of sensitive data. It simply causes a legitimate PTP operation to fail due to incorrect parameter validation.
  The commit is a straightforward bug fix that addresses a regression introduced when converting from `convert_art_ns_to_tsc()` to the new `convert_base_to_cs()` API, where the developer forgot to set the `use_nsecs` flag to indicate the timestamp format.
0c6f4631436ec iavf: fix reset_task for early reset event
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the similar commits provided for reference, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional bug fix that addresses a timing issue where the VF driver hangs for about 25 seconds when a reset event is received early in the initialization cycle. The issue is purely a quality/performance problem - it causes a delay in initialization but does not create any security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The commit fixes a state machine hang that occurs during early reset events. The consequences are:
     - The driver hangs for ~25 seconds during initialization
     - Eventually recovers and continues normally
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - The fix adds a check in `iavf_reset_task()` to handle early reset states (`adapter->state <= __IAVF_INIT_FAILED`)
     - When in early states, it properly restarts the initialization sequence
     - In `iavf_poll_virtchnl_msg()`, it adds handling for `VIRTCHNL_EVENT_RESET_IMPENDING` events during polling
     - These changes simply improve the reset handling logic without addressing any security boundary violations
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs addressed:
     - Hang during system shutdown/reboot that could prevent proper system shutdown
     - Resource cleanup ordering issues that could lead to memory corruption
     - Concurrent reset and removal issues that could cause crashes
     - These had potential for system disruption or memory safety issues
  5. **This commit differs because**:
     - It only causes a temporary delay in driver initialization
     - No system-wide impact (no shutdown/reboot issues)
     - No memory safety violations
     - No potential for crashes or system instability
     - The system remains functional, just delayed
  The fix improves the driver's robustness and user experience but does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
fb4e9239e0299 i40e: retry VFLR handling if there is ongoing VF reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a race condition where a VFLR (Virtual Function Level Reset) interrupt might not be fully handled if there's an ongoing VF reset from another source. This is a functionality/reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue can leave the VF in an "undefined state" according to the commit message, but this appears to be a functional state issue rather than a security compromise. There's no indication of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond normal VF functionality issues
  3. **Code change analysis**: The fix simply changes:
     ```c
     i40e_reset_vf(vf, true);
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     if (!i40e_reset_vf(vf, true)) {
         set_bit(__I40E_VFLR_EVENT_PENDING, pf->state);
     }
     ```
     
     This just ensures that if a VF reset returns false (indicating it couldn't complete because another reset is in progress), the VFLR event is marked as pending to be retried later.
  4. **Return value behavior**: Looking at `i40e_reset_vf()`, it returns `true` in most cases including when a VF is already being reset (line 1568-1569). The commit's logic appears inverted - it sets the pending bit when the function returns `false`, but the function seems to always return `true` based on the code examined.
  5. **Compared to similar CVE commits**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed use-after-free bugs, uninitialized variable access, and race conditions with security implications), this commit only addresses a functional issue where VF reset handling might need to be retried.
a2c90d63b7122 i40e: return false from i40e_reset_vf if reset is in progress
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug allows a malicious VF to cause denial of service to other VFs. When `i40e_reset_vf()` incorrectly returns `true` while a reset is already in progress, the retry mechanism in `i40e_vc_reset_vf()` fails to work properly. This means VF reset requests are silently ignored, leading to VF hangs.
  2. **Attack Vector**: A malicious VM/VF can exploit this by:
     - Triggering rapid reset requests via VIRTCHNL_OP_RESET_VF
     - Using other virtchannel operations that trigger resets (VIRTCHNL_OP_REQUEST_QUEUES, VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_CHANNELS)
     - Creating a race condition where legitimate VF resets fail
  3. **Real-World Impact**: The commit message explicitly states "servers hang in very hard to reproduce conditions with resets races", indicating this has caused production issues.
  4. **Privilege Boundary Violation**: This allows one VF to affect the operation of other VFs, crossing the isolation boundary between virtual functions.
  5. **Long Exposure Window**: The vulnerability existed for approximately 2.5 years (from commit 52424f974bc5 in October 2022 until this fix), affecting multiple kernel versions.
  The code change itself is minimal but critical - changing from `return true` to `return false` when a reset is already in progress - but this small change fixes a significant denial of service vulnerability in virtualized environments using Intel i40e network adapters.
5558f27a58459 pinctrl: sunxi: dt: Consider pin base when calculating bank number from pin
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes an out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. Without this fix, when calculating bank numbers for R_PIO controllers (which use pin bases like PL_BASE=352), the code would calculate incorrect bank indices that exceed the bounds of the `irq_bank_muxes` array (size 11, indices 0-10).
  For example, PL pins starting at base 352 would calculate bank = 352/32 = 11, which is out of bounds. This could lead to:
  - Reading arbitrary kernel memory beyond the array
  - Potential kernel crashes if accessing unmapped memory  
  - Security bypass through incorrect IRQ configuration based on garbage values
  This is similar to the gpio-davinci out-of-bounds access that was assigned a CVE (Similar Commit 3).
0cee6c4d3518b drm/meson: fix more rounding issues with 59.94Hz modes
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix for video clock calculation precision issues with 59.94Hz display modes. The commit fixes rounding errors in frequency comparisons that prevented certain display modes from working correctly.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes only affect:
     - Removing unused macros (`PIXEL_FREQ_1000_1001` and `PHY_FREQ_1000_1001`)
     - Adding a new helper function `meson_vclk_freqs_are_matching_param()` that allows small deviations in frequency matching (< 1kHz for vclk, < 10kHz for phy_freq)
     - Refactoring frequency comparison logic to be more tolerant of rounding errors
  3. **Display functionality issue only**: The bug being fixed causes video playback issues with 59.94Hz modes - it's a display/rendering problem, not a security vulnerability. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Input validation failure that could be exploited
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar display/clock frequency calculation issues in DRM drivers. None of these functional display fixes were assigned CVEs.
  The commit simply improves the precision of frequency matching to fix a regression introduced by a previous commit that changed from kHz to Hz calculations.
faf2f8382088e drm/meson: use vclk_freq instead of pixel_freq in debug print
- [sasha] Based on the analysis and comparison with similar commits:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. The change is purely cosmetic, modifying debug print statements to display `vclk_freq` instead of `pixel_freq` for clarity. The security analysis reveals:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: The change only affects debug output that prints frequency values already present in the function parameters
  2. **No sensitive data exposure**: Display frequencies are hardware specifications, not sensitive information
  3. **Protected debug output**: These debug messages require root access to enable/view via `/sys/module/drm/parameters/debug`
  4. **Pure debugging improvement**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "avoid confusion when analyzing error reports"
  Comparing to similar commits:
  - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Type conversion changes for precision
  - Similar Commit 2 (NO CVE): Reverted calculation fix  
  - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): Calculation fix for fractional rates
  - Similar Commit 4 (YES CVE): NULL pointer dereference fixes (actual security issue)
  - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Clock gating fix
  This commit follows the pattern of non-security debug/logging improvements seen in Similar Commits 1-3, unlike Commit 4 which fixed actual memory safety issues.
d17e61ab63fb7 drm/meson: fix debug log statement when setting the HDMI clocks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It's purely a cosmetic fix**: The commit only swaps the order of labels in a debug log statement from:
     ```c
     "vclk:%lluHz phy=%lluHz venc=%lluHz hdmi=%lluHz enci=%d\n"
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     "phy:%lluHz vclk=%lluHz venc=%lluHz hdmi=%lluHz enci=%d\n"
     ```
  2. **No functional change**: The actual values being printed remain in the same order (`phy_freq, vclk_freq, venc_freq, hdmi_freq`). Only the labels were incorrectly ordered, making the debug output confusing but not affecting any system behavior.
  3. **Debug-only impact**: This is a `dev_dbg()` statement which only affects debugging output when debug logging is enabled. It has no impact on:
     - Security
     - System functionality
     - Data integrity
     - Access control
     - Memory safety
  4. **No exploitable vulnerability**: A mislabeled debug log cannot be exploited to compromise a system. It merely makes debugging more difficult when the labels don't match the actual values being printed.
  This is similar to the other "NO" CVE commits in the reference list which involve non-security fixes like clock frequency calculation adjustments that don't create exploitable vulnerabilities.
c0317ad44f45b drm/vc4: fix infinite EPROBE_DEFER loop
- [sasha] **NO**
  While this commit fixes a documented driver model issue, it does not represent a security vulnerability. The infinite EPROBE_DEFER loop is a functionality bug that prevents proper driver initialization, but it does not create any security risks such as:
  - Memory corruption or buffer overflows
  - Privilege escalation
  - Information disclosure
  - Denial of service attacks
  - Access control bypass
  The code change simply reorders the initialization sequence to comply with the Linux driver model requirement that child devices should not be created before returning EPROBE_DEFER. The fix moves `drm_connector_hdmi_audio_init()` (which creates a child device via `platform_device_register_data()`) to after the calls that might return EPROBE_DEFER (`devm_snd_dmaengine_pcm_register()` and `devm_snd_soc_register_component()`).
  This is purely a driver initialization ordering issue that affects functionality but has no security implications.
0d67f0dee6c91 powerpc/vas: Return -EINVAL if the offset is non-zero in mmap()
- [sasha] Perfect! I found the example code at line 286. Notice that the mmap call uses `0ULL` as the offset parameter. The commit is adding validation to ensure that the offset must be zero.
  Now let me analyze the security implications by understanding what happens when a non-zero offset is passed:
  Looking at line 568 of the coproc_mmap function:
  ```c
  rc = remap_pfn_range(vma, vma->vm_start, pfn + vma->vm_pgoff,
                       vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start, prot);
  ```
  The issue is that `pfn + vma->vm_pgoff` is used as the physical frame number. If a user passes a non-zero offset via mmap(), they could potentially map arbitrary physical memory pages beyond the intended paste address region.
  Let me check if there are any similar security issues in the references:
  **Analysis:**
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The vulnerability requires a local user with access to `/dev/crypto/nx-gzip`. This is not a privileged device (as documented: "No special privileges are needed to open the device").
  2. **Restricted Mapping Range**: Even with a non-zero offset, the user can only potentially access physical memory starting from the paste address + offset. The paste address is a specific hardware region for the VAS window, not arbitrary kernel memory.
  3. **Hardware-Specific**: This only affects PowerPC systems with VAS (Virtual Accelerator Switchboard) hardware, specifically Power9 processors with NX-GZIP accelerators.
  4. **Limited Impact**: The mapping is still constrained by:
     - The PAGE_SIZE check (only one page can be mapped)
     - The VM protection flags (VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP)
     - The hardware paste address region
  5. **Input Validation Fix**: This is primarily an input validation fix to enforce the documented API contract (offset must be 0ULL) rather than fixing a security vulnerability that allows privilege escalation or information disclosure.
  Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which involved:
  - Use-after-free vulnerabilities (commits 1 & 2)
  - NULL pointer dereferences leading to potential crashes (commit 5)
  This commit simply adds proper input validation for an undocumented parameter usage that could at most allow mapping of adjacent hardware register pages, not arbitrary kernel memory.
cd097df4596f3 powerpc/powernv/memtrace: Fix out of bounds issue in memtrace mmap
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The code contains an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in the `memtrace_mmap()` function. The original bounds checking was incomplete - it verified that the requested mapping size fits within the buffer and that the offset is valid, but failed to check if `offset + size` exceeds the buffer bounds.
  2. **Exploitable Attack Vector**: An attacker with access to the debugfs interface (mode 0600, requiring root) could mmap memory beyond the allocated memtrace buffer. For example:
     - With a 2-page buffer (ent->size = 0x2000)
     - Request offset of 1 page (vm_pgoff = 1) 
     - Request size of 2 pages (vm_end - vm_start = 0x2000)
     - This passes both checks but maps pages [1,2], where page 2 is out of bounds
  3. **Information Disclosure**: This vulnerability allows reading physical memory beyond the intended buffer boundaries through the mmap interface, potentially exposing:
     - Kernel memory contents
     - Memory from other processes
     - Sensitive system data
  4. **Similar to Other CVEs**: This follows the same pattern as the other CVE-assigned commits shown - bounds checking errors that allow out-of-bounds memory access. The commit specifically mentions "out of bounds issue" and was reported by an external researcher.
  5. **Clear Security Fix**: The patch adds proper bounds validation by checking `vma_nrpages > ent_nrpages - vma->vm_pgoff`, ensuring the entire requested mapping range stays within the allocated buffer.
  While this requires root access (debugfs file mode 0600), it's still a security boundary violation that could be part of a privilege escalation chain or used to bypass other security mechanisms.
82ffbe7776d0a net_sched: sch_sfq: fix a potential crash on gso_skb handling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the additional context I've gathered, here is my determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  ## Reasoning:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes a crash vulnerability in the SFQ (Stochastic Fair Queueing) scheduler that can be triggered through specific network configurations. The crash occurs due to improper handling of the `q->tail` pointer when all slots have length 1.
  2. **Type Confusion/Memory Safety Issue**: The fix addresses a scenario where `q->tail->next` could be dereferenced when there's only one active slot (where `slot->next == x`), leading to improper queue state management and potential memory corruption.
  3. **Exploitability**: The commit message provides a clear proof-of-concept showing how to trigger the crash:
     - Set up a specific network configuration with SFQ and specific limits
     - Use multiple concurrent netperf sessions to trigger the race condition
     - The crash occurs when the qdisc tries to handle packets in the edge case where all slots have length 1
  4. **Root Cause**: The vulnerability stems from the interaction between the gso_skb queue (introduced in commit a53851e2c321) and SFQ's assumption of always being able to queue at least one packet. When `sch->q.len` is inflated by packets in `sch->gso_skb`, an enqueue on an empty SFQ can be followed by an immediate drop, leading to incorrect tail pointer management.
  5. **Similar CVE Patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixes array-index-out-of-bounds in SFQ
     - Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Also fixes limit validation issues in SFQ
     - Commit 5 (CVE: YES) - Fixes another validation issue that could lead to crashes
  This commit follows the same pattern of fixing a crash vulnerability in the SFQ scheduler that can be triggered through specific network configurations, making it a security-relevant fix that warrants CVE assignment.
9b17621366d21 scsi: iscsi: Fix incorrect error path labels for flashnode operations
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the code changes to see if this could lead to a security vulnerability:
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is purely a code correctness problem. When `scsi_host_lookup()` fails and returns NULL, jumping to the `put_host` label would cause `scsi_host_put(shost)` to be called with a NULL pointer, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference at `shost->shost_gendev`.
  2. **Error path only**: This issue only occurs in error handling paths when the host lookup fails, which is not a normal operation flow. The functions affected are:
     - `iscsi_new_flashnode()` 
     - `iscsi_del_flashnode()`
     - `iscsi_login_flashnode()`
     - `iscsi_logout_flashnode()`
     - `iscsi_logout_flashnode_sid()`
  3. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel would cause a crash/panic, but this doesn't lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts. It's a reliability issue, not a security issue.
  4. **Similar commits without CVEs**: Looking at the similar commits provided, we see that simple error path fixes and resource leak fixes (like Similar Commit 1 - scsi_host_put() missing in error path) are not assigned CVEs. Only commits that fix actual security vulnerabilities like use-after-free conditions (Similar Commit 2) receive CVE assignments.
  The commit correctly fixes the error handling by jumping to the appropriate exit labels instead of trying to put a NULL host reference, but this is a bug fix for code correctness and reliability, not a security vulnerability fix.
779a0c9e06a91 accel/amdxdna: Fix incorrect PSP firmware size
- [sasha] Now let's analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is about incorrect PSP firmware size calculation, but it doesn't create a memory corruption or buffer overflow vulnerability. Looking at the code changes:
     - Old: `psp->fw_buf_sz = ALIGN(conf->fw_size, PSP_FW_ALIGN) + PSP_FW_ALIGN;`
     - New: `psp->fw_buf_sz = ALIGN(conf->fw_size, PSP_FW_ALIGN);`
     - The buffer allocation remains: `drmm_kmalloc(ddev, psp->fw_buf_sz + PSP_FW_ALIGN, GFP_KERNEL)`
  2. **Over-allocation, not under-allocation**: The bug was that `fw_buf_sz` was set too large (by an extra PSP_FW_ALIGN), not too small. This would cause the PSP hardware to receive an incorrect (larger) size value when validating firmware in line 97: `reg_vals[3] = psp->fw_buf_sz;`
  3. **No memory safety issue**: The actual buffer allocation was always correct. The memcpy at line 143 copies `conf->fw_size` bytes, which is the actual firmware size, not the incorrectly calculated `fw_buf_sz`.
  4. **Functional bug, not security bug**: This would likely cause firmware validation failures with newer firmware versions that might check size bounds more strictly, but it doesn't expose any attack surface or create memory corruption opportunities.
  Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual buffer overflows, out-of-bounds writes, or missing validation that could be exploited, this commit fixes a calculation error that results in passing an incorrect (but safe) parameter to the PSP hardware.
315345610faee pinctrl: qcom: pinctrl-qcm2290: Add missing pins
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** CVE.
  The commit adds missing pin definitions to the `qcm2290_pins` table. While the pin groups (PINGROUP) were already defined for these GPIO pins (65-68, 83-85, 92-93), the corresponding pin descriptors were missing from the pin descriptor table.
  This is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. **No memory corruption or crashes**: Unlike the x1e80100 commits that had incorrect offsets (0x1f9000 instead of 0xf9000) which could cause system crashes, this commit simply adds missing pin descriptors. The pinctrl framework has proper bounds checking through radix tree lookups.
  2. **Functional bug, not security issue**: The missing pins would cause those specific GPIOs to be unavailable for use, but this is a functionality limitation rather than a security vulnerability. The pinctrl core uses radix_tree_lookup() which safely returns NULL for missing pins.
  3. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The bug doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or exposure of sensitive data. It simply prevents certain pins from being configured.
  4. **Similar commits don't get CVEs**: Looking at the historical commits with similar fixes (like commit 07963c02067f for S32G2 pins), these types of missing pin definition fixes are treated as regular bug fixes, not security issues.
  The x1e80100 commits received CVE status because they had incorrect memory offsets that could cause system crashes when accessing those pins, which is a more severe issue than simply having missing pin definitions.
10c24e0d2f7cd spi: omap2-mcspi: Disable multi-mode when the previous message kept CS asserted
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's what I understand:
  1. **Multi-mode vs Single-mode**: 
     - In SINGLE mode, the host manually controls chip select (CS) using the FORCE bit
     - In MULTI mode, each CS is bound to a FIFO and hardware automatically handles CS
  2. **The bug being fixed**:
     - When a message ends with `cs_change` flag set on the last transfer, the CS is kept asserted after the message
     - The next message would incorrectly use multi-mode, which would cause CS to be briefly deasserted before the first transfer
     - This breaks the expected CS behavior where it should remain continuously asserted between messages
  3. **The fix**:
     - Adds tracking of whether the previous message kept CS asserted (`last_msg_kept_cs`)
     - Disables multi-mode for the next message if the previous one kept CS asserted
     - Removes the early loop exit to ensure the last transfer is always checked
  **CVE Assessment: NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment because:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The bug causes incorrect chip select timing behavior, which could lead to communication errors with SPI devices, but does not create any security risks.
  2. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The issue doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant impact.
  3. **Limited scope**: This only affects specific SPI communication patterns (when cs_change is used on the last transfer) and would result in protocol errors rather than exploitable conditions.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO") also deal with SPI controller timing, mode switching, and chip select handling issues - none of which were assigned CVEs as they are functional bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit fixes a legitimate bug that could cause SPI communication failures in certain scenarios, but this is a reliability/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
a5bf5272295d3 spi: omap2-mcspi: Disable multi mode when CS should be kept asserted after message
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change fixes a functional correctness issue in the OMAP2 McSPI driver where the multi-mode hardware doesn't properly handle the `cs_change` flag on the last transfer. The code change simply adds logic to disable multi-mode when `tr->cs_change` is true on the last transfer:
  ```c
  if (list_is_last(&tr->transfer_list, &msg->transfers)) {
      /* Check if transfer asks to keep the CS status after the whole message */
      if (tr->cs_change)
          mcspi->use_multi_mode = false;
  }
  ```
  This is a protocol compliance bug, not a security vulnerability. It doesn't introduce any:
  - Memory corruption or buffer overflows
  - Information disclosure
  - Privilege escalation
  - Access control bypass
  - Remote code execution
  The impact is limited to incorrect SPI communication behavior with devices that require the chip select to remain asserted between messages, which is a functional/reliability issue rather than a security concern.
06118ae36855b regulator: max20086: Fix refcount leak in max20086_parse_regulators_dt()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Resource leak, not security vulnerability**: The issue is a reference count leak when `devm_kcalloc()` fails. The code obtains a device tree node via `of_get_child_by_name()` (which increments refcount) at line 140, but if `devm_kcalloc()` fails at line 146-149, it returns -ENOMEM without calling `of_node_put()` to decrement the refcount.
  2. **Limited security impact**: This is a resource leak that occurs only in error conditions (memory allocation failure). While reference count leaks can theoretically lead to memory exhaustion over time, this specific case:
     - Only occurs during device probe failure due to memory allocation failure
     - Device probe failures typically don't happen repeatedly in normal operation
     - The leaked resource is just a device tree node reference, not actual memory content
  3. **No exploitability**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES", this leak:
     - Cannot be triggered by unprivileged users
     - Occurs only during kernel initialization/device probe
     - Requires the system to already be in a low memory condition
     - Does not lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  4. **Different from CVE-worthy refcount leaks**: The similar commits that received CVEs involved refcount leaks in paths that could be triggered during normal operation or by user actions, potentially leading to denial of service through resource exhaustion. This commit fixes a leak that only occurs during a rare error condition in device initialization.
  The fix properly uses the cleanup.h `__free(device_node)` attribute to ensure automatic cleanup, which is a good defensive programming practice, but the issue itself does not meet the threshold for CVE assignment.
f3fe49dbddd73 wifi: ath12k: fix uaf in ath12k_core_init()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in `ath12k_core_init()`. UAF vulnerabilities are serious security issues that can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
  2. **Specific UAF Scenario**: The commit message clearly describes that when `ath12k_core_hw_group_assign()` or `ath12k_core_hw_group_create()` fails, the panic notifier chain is not properly unregistered. This leads to:
     - The notifier chain remaining registered
     - Memory being freed after module removal (rmmod)
     - Subsequent access to the freed notifier chain causing UAF
  3. **Pattern Match with Similar CVEs**: The similar commits #1, #2, #3, and #5 all received CVEs for fixing double-free and UAF issues in the same ath12k driver. These commits show a pattern where improper cleanup in error paths leads to memory safety issues.
  4. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds proper cleanup by calling `ath12k_core_panic_notifier_unregister(ab)` in the error paths:
     ```c
     +err_destroy_hw_group:
      ath12k_core_hw_group_destroy(ab->ag);
      ath12k_core_hw_group_unassign(ab);
     +err_unregister_notifier:
     +	ath12k_core_panic_notifier_unregister(ab);
     ```
  5. **Impact**: The call trace shows this occurs during normal driver operations (probe/init), making it a realistic attack vector or reliability issue that could be triggered during normal system operation.
  This is a classic UAF vulnerability with clear security implications, similar to the other CVE-assigned commits in the same driver subsystem.

- [sasha] Prompt is too long
5257324583e32 wifi: ath12k: refactor ath12k_hw_regs structure
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the key changes in the commit. Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of Changes**: This is a pure refactoring commit that changes hardcoded register addresses to be dynamically looked up from the hardware parameters structure. The key changes are:
     - Converting hardcoded `#define` values (like `HAL_TCL1_RING_BASE_LSB`) to dynamic lookups via macros that use `(ab)->hw_params->regs->`
     - Adding new fields to the `ath12k_hw_regs` structure to store register addresses
     - No change in actual functionality or security behavior
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit message states it's refactoring to "accommodate these changes in IPQ5332" - this is about hardware compatibility, not fixing any security issue. There's no mention of:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control issues
     - Input validation problems
     - Race conditions
  3. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Looking at the changes:
     - Old: `#define HAL_TCL1_RING_BASE_LSB 0x00000900`
     - New: `#define HAL_TCL1_RING_BASE_LSB(ab) ((ab)->hw_params->regs->hal_tcl1_ring_base_lsb)`
     
     This is simply changing from static definitions to dynamic lookups for hardware abstraction.
  4. **Similar Commits**: Comparing to the reference commits:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed struct definition mismatch that could cause "random failures"
     - Similar Commit 3 (YES CVE): Fixed bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds write
     - This commit: Pure refactoring with no security implications
  The commit is a straightforward refactoring to support different hardware variants with different register layouts. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability or introduce any security-relevant changes.
b0d226a60856a wifi: ath11k: validate ath11k_crypto_mode on top of ath11k_core_qmi_firmware_ready
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue clearly. In the original code, when an invalid crypto_mode is detected at line 1978, the function returns -EINVAL directly without cleaning up the resources that were allocated:
  1. `ath11k_core_start_firmware()` - started the firmware
  2. `ath11k_ce_init_pipes()` - initialized CE pipes  
  3. `ath11k_dp_alloc()` - allocated DP resources
  The error handling paths show that these need cleanup:
  - `err_firmware_stop:` calls `ath11k_qmi_firmware_stop(ab)` 
  - `err_dp_free:` calls `ath11k_dp_free(ab)` before jumping to `err_firmware_stop`
  The commit fixes this by moving the crypto_mode validation to the beginning of the function, before any resources are allocated.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a resource leak bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when an invalid crypto_mode parameter is provided, the function fails to clean up allocated resources (firmware, CE pipes, DP allocation).
  2. **User-Controlled but Not Exploitable**: While the `ath11k_crypto_mode` is a module parameter that can be set by users with appropriate privileges, providing an invalid value simply causes a resource leak during module initialization - it doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The resource leak only occurs during driver initialization when an invalid parameter is provided. This would typically cause the driver to fail to load properly, and the leaked resources would be cleaned up when the module is unloaded or the system reboots.
  4. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (locking fix) - NO CVE
     - Commit 2 (revert) - NO CVE  
     - Commit 4 (copyright update) - NO CVE
     - Commit 5 (hibernation revert) - NO CVE
     
     Only Commit 3 received a CVE because it fixed a double-free issue that could potentially be exploited.
  This commit is a code quality improvement that fixes a static analysis warning about missing cleanup on an error path, but it doesn't address any security vulnerability.
72610ed7d79da wifi: ath11k: move some firmware stats related functions outside of debugfs
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze both the commit message and code changes to determine if it fixes a security vulnerability.
  **Commit Summary:**
  - Subject: "wifi: ath11k: move some firmware stats related functions outside of debugfs"
  - Fixes two previous commits that introduced bugs where debugfs functions were called in mac ops
  - When CONFIG_ATH11K_DEBUGFS is not enabled, these functions become no-ops, causing wrong status to be reported
  **Code Analysis:**
  1. **The Bug**: The commit message indicates that `ath11k_debugfs_get_fw_stats()` was being called from mac80211 operations (in `ath11k_mac_op_sta_statistics()`). When CONFIG_ATH11K_DEBUGFS is disabled, this function becomes a no-op that always returns 0, causing incorrect statistics reporting.
  2. **Code Changes**:
     - Moves `ath11k_debugfs_fw_stats_reset()` and `ath11k_debugfs_fw_stats_request()` from debugfs.c to mac.c as `ath11k_mac_fw_stats_reset()` and `ath11k_mac_fw_stats_request()`
     - Creates a new `ath11k_mac_get_fw_stats()` function in mac.c
     - Updates callers to use the new mac.c versions instead of debugfs versions
     - Removes the stub `ath11k_debugfs_get_fw_stats()` that returned 0 when CONFIG_ATH11K_DEBUGFS was disabled
  3. **Security Impact Assessment**:
     - This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability
     - The issue only affects statistics reporting accuracy when CONFIG_ATH11K_DEBUGFS is disabled
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data leakage
     - No impact on system integrity or availability
     - Simply causes incorrect RSSI (signal strength) statistics to be reported to userspace
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a use-after-free vulnerability with RCU protection
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) - Fixed missing RCU locking that could cause use-after-free
     - This commit does not fix any memory safety issues or race conditions
  **Conclusion:**
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug where firmware statistics are incorrectly reported when CONFIG_ATH11K_DEBUGFS is disabled. The bug only affects the accuracy of reported signal strength statistics and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. There is no memory corruption, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure beyond incorrect stats, and no denial of service. This is a quality/correctness issue rather than a security issue.

- [sasha] Prompt is too long
2bcf73b2612dd wifi: ath11k: don't use static variables in ath11k_debugfs_fw_stats_process()
- [sasha] Looking at the commit carefully:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Non-exploitable bug**: The issue is a logic bug in debugfs statistics processing where static variables (`num_vdev` and `num_bcn`) are used to count firmware stat events. If these counters don't get reset properly due to certain conditions not being met, subsequent firmware stats requests may fail.
  2. **No security impact**: The bug only affects debugfs functionality used for debugging/statistics gathering. It doesn't:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Cause memory corruption
     - Enable unauthorized access
     - Lead to information disclosure
     - Cause denial of service beyond debug statistics not working
  3. **Limited scope**: The impact is limited to the debugging interface not properly displaying firmware statistics. As stated in the commit message, it just causes the condition `(++num_vdev) == total_vdevs_started` to never be satisfied in subsequent requests, making the debug statistics collection fail.
  4. **Fix nature**: The fix simply moves from static variables to struct members (`ar->fw_stats.num_vdev_recvd` and `ar->fw_stats.num_bcn_recvd`) that get properly reset on each request, ensuring clean state for each statistics request.
  This is a functional bug fix for a debugging interface, not a security vulnerability.

1650d32b92b01 ath10k: snoc: fix unbalanced IRQ enable in crash recovery
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The issue is an IRQ enable/disable imbalance that occurs specifically during firmware crash recovery. The code changes show:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The original commit (0e622f67e041) skipped disabling IRQs in `ath10k_snoc_hif_stop()` during crash recovery but still unconditionally enabled them in `ath10k_snoc_hif_start()`, creating an imbalance.
  2. **Impact**: The imbalance causes "unbalanced IRQ enable splats" (kernel warnings) as mentioned in the commit message. These are non-fatal WARN() messages that pollute kernel logs but don't crash the system.
  3. **No security implications**: 
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - No privilege escalation possibilities
     - No denial of service beyond log spam
     - The kernel's IRQ subsystem has built-in protection against unbalanced enable calls
  4. **Functionality issue only**: This is a driver quality issue that affects proper IRQ management during crash recovery. The fix ensures IRQs are only enabled when not in recovery mode (matching the disable logic).
  This is similar to the other non-CVE commits shown as examples - they fix driver bugs that affect functionality and stability but don't introduce security vulnerabilities.
87f7ce260a3c8 ptp: remove ptp->n_vclocks check logic in ptp_vclock_in_use()
- [sasha] Now I need to analyze whether this is a security vulnerability:
  1. **What was the bug?** A deadlock (recursive mutex acquisition) that could be triggered through sysfs when writing to `/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/n_vclocks`
  2. **What is the impact?** This is a local denial of service vulnerability where a user with access to the PTP sysfs interface can cause a kernel deadlock
  3. **Is it exploitable?** Yes, any user with write access to the PTP sysfs files can trigger this deadlock
  4. **What are the security implications?** 
     - Denial of Service: The system would deadlock, requiring a reboot
     - Local attack vector: Requires local access to sysfs
     - No privilege escalation or data corruption
  5. **Does the fix properly address the issue?** Yes, by removing the mutex acquisition, it eliminates the recursive locking
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a **deadlock vulnerability** that can be triggered by local users with access to PTP sysfs files
  2. The deadlock represents a **denial of service** attack vector where the kernel becomes unresponsive
  3. The commit message explicitly describes a "WARNING: possible recursive locking detected" with a clear deadlock scenario
  4. The vulnerability has a **clear attack vector** through writing to `/sys/class/ptp/ptpN/n_vclocks`
  5. Similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the examples which also fixed deadlock issues (e.g., "net/sched: Fix mirred deadlock on device recursion" and "net: vlan: don't propagate flags on open")
  The vulnerability allows a local attacker to cause a kernel deadlock by manipulating PTP virtual clock settings through sysfs, resulting in a system hang that requires a reboot to recover.
692eb9f8a5b71 net: dsa: b53: fix untagged traffic sent via cpu tagged with VID 0
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The key evidence:
  1. **Explicit low impact statement**: The commit message states "Since Linux (and the switch) treats VLAN 0 tagged traffic like untagged, the actual impact of this is rather low"
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The issue is that untagged traffic gets incorrectly tagged with VID 0, but VID 0 is treated identically to untagged traffic by both Linux and the switch hardware. No VLAN isolation is compromised.
  3. **Code changes analysis**: 
     - Removed `vl->untag = vl->members;` (line that was clearing untag bits)
     - Removed `vl->untag |= BIT(port) | BIT(cpu_port);` (line that was setting untag bits)
     - These changes only affect packet tagging format, not security boundaries
  4. **Nature of the bug**: This is a regression that caused incorrect VLAN tagging behavior after a previous security fix (commit 45e9d59d3950). The packets still reach their intended destinations; they're just incorrectly formatted with a VID 0 tag that has no practical impact.
  This is similar to the non-CVE commits in the reference list - it's a VLAN handling fix that improves correctness but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
6fe26f694c824 Bluetooth: MGMT: Protect mgmt_pending list with its own lock
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now make a determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The KASAN report clearly shows a slab-use-after-free vulnerability in `hci_sock_get_channel()` when accessing `cmd->sk` after it has been freed. This is a memory safety issue that can lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
  2. **Race Condition**: The root cause is a race condition between concurrent access to the `mgmt_pending` list. One thread can free a `mgmt_pending_cmd` structure (including the associated socket) while another thread is still traversing the list and trying to access the freed memory.
  3. **Local Attack Vector**: This appears to be exploitable by local users who can interact with the Bluetooth management interface through HCI sockets. While it requires local access, it could potentially be used for privilege escalation.
  4. **Concrete Exploitation Path**: The stack trace shows the vulnerability can be triggered through normal Bluetooth management operations (`remove_adv_monitor` operation), making it practically exploitable.
  5. **Security Impact**: Use-after-free vulnerabilities are considered security issues as they can lead to:
     - System crashes (DoS)
     - Information disclosure (reading freed memory)
     - Potentially arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data
  The fix adds proper locking (`mgmt_pending_lock` mutex) to protect concurrent access to the `mgmt_pending` list, preventing the race condition that leads to the use-after-free vulnerability. This is a classic security fix for a memory safety issue in the kernel.
e6ed54e86aae9 Bluetooth: MGMT: Fix UAF on mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete
- [sasha] Now I understand the UAF scenario. Let me examine the changes in the commit:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability and should be assigned a CVE. Here's the detailed analysis:
  **Vulnerability Details:**
  1. **KASAN Report Analysis**: The commit message shows a clear KASAN slab-use-after-free report in `mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete+0xe5/0x540` at line 5406, where the code reads 8 bytes from freed memory.
  2. **Root Cause**: The UAF occurs due to a race condition between two concurrent operations:
     - Task 5987 allocates a `mgmt_pending_cmd` structure via `mgmt_pending_add()` in `remove_adv_monitor()`
     - Task 5989 frees this structure via `mgmt_pending_foreach()` in `mgmt_index_removed()`
     - Later, the workqueue tries to access the freed structure in `mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete()`
  3. **Race Condition Flow**:
     - `remove_adv_monitor()` adds a pending command using `mgmt_pending_add()`
     - `mgmt_index_removed()` is called (e.g., when unbinding HCI device) which calls `mgmt_pending_foreach()` → `cmd_complete_rsp()` → `mgmt_pending_remove()`, freeing all pending commands
     - The async callback `mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete()` then tries to access the freed command structure
  4. **Security Impact**: This UAF vulnerability could potentially lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Information disclosure (reading freed memory)
     - Potential code execution if the freed memory is reallocated and controlled by an attacker
  5. **Fix Analysis**: The commit fixes this by:
     - Changing from `mgmt_pending_add()` to `mgmt_pending_new()` which doesn't add the command to the pending list
     - Using `mgmt_pending_free()` instead of `mgmt_pending_remove()` in the completion handler
     - Removing the `pending_find()` check in `mgmt_remove_adv_monitor_complete()` that was trying to validate if the command still exists
  This vulnerability has similar characteristics to the "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 2" which were both assigned CVEs for slab-use-after-free vulnerabilities in Bluetooth MGMT code.
bf2ffc4d14db2 Bluetooth: btintel_pcie: Reduce driver buffer posting to prevent race condition
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the provided information:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit reduces the number of RX buffers posted from the full 64 to 61 (64-3) to work around a "hardware issue causing a race condition in the firmware." This is a stability/reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Impact assessment**: The change mitigates a race condition that affects "stability and data handling" - there's no indication this could be exploited for:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Memory corruption
     - Denial of service beyond normal driver instability
  3. **Code analysis**: The change simply modifies the loop in `btintel_pcie_start_rx()` from:
     ```c
     for (i = 0; i < rxq->count; i++)
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     for (i = 0; i < rxq->count - 3; i++)
     ```
     This is a simple workaround that posts fewer buffers to avoid triggering a firmware bug.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the historical commits:
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE Status: NO) also fixed a race condition in the same driver
     - The race conditions in this driver appear to be timing/synchronization issues that affect functionality rather than security
  5. **Security relevance**: The commit message and code changes don't indicate any security boundary violations, memory safety issues, or exploitable conditions. It's a hardware/firmware compatibility workaround to improve driver stability.
  This is a typical driver reliability fix that works around hardware/firmware limitations, not a security vulnerability fix.
2dd711102ce69 Bluetooth: btintel_pcie: Increase the tx and rx descriptor count
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While the commit message mentions "preventing buffer overflows," this is misleading terminology. The code changes simply increase the descriptor ring sizes:
  ```c
  -#define BTINTEL_DESCS_COUNT	16
  +#define BTINTEL_PCIE_TX_DESCS_COUNT	32
  +#define BTINTEL_PCIE_RX_DESCS_COUNT	64
  ```
  This is not fixing a memory corruption vulnerability but rather addressing a performance issue where the descriptor rings could become exhausted during bursty HID traffic. The "overflow" refers to running out of available descriptors in the ring buffer, causing dropped packets and increased latency - not a security-exploitable buffer overflow. This is a routine performance optimization common in network/communication drivers and does not have any security impact.
daabd27698505 Bluetooth: btintel_pcie: Fix driver not posting maximum rx buffers
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security implications:
  1. **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability**: The insufficient RX buffers (6 instead of 16) can be exploited by remote attackers within Bluetooth range to trigger firmware exceptions by sending bursts of traffic. The commit message clearly shows firmware exceptions occurring in HID use cases with error codes like `boot stage: 0xe0fb0047` and mailbox values of `0x00badbad`.
  2. **Remote exploitability**: Any device within Bluetooth range can trigger this vulnerability without authentication, especially during HID event bursts (mouse movements, keyboard input).
  3. **System instability**: The firmware exceptions cause the Bluetooth subsystem to halt and dump debug information, potentially leading to:
     - Loss of Bluetooth functionality
     - System crashes requiring reboot
     - Unpredictable behavior in firmware exceptional state
  4. **Information disclosure**: The debug dumps expose internal firmware state including memory contents, IPC status, and mailbox values that could leak sensitive information.
  5. **Pattern similarity to CVE-assigned issues**: This follows the pattern of other Bluetooth buffer-related vulnerabilities that received CVEs, such as:
     - Memory corruption issues in similar commits that got CVE assignments (like the first two similar commits shown)
     - Buffer exhaustion vulnerabilities in networking subsystems
  The code change shows the critical fix:
  ```c
  // Vulnerable: Only 6 buffers posted
  for (i = 0; i < BTINTEL_PCIE_RX_MAX_QUEUE; i++)
  // Fixed: All 16 allocated buffers posted  
  for (i = 0; i < rxq->count; i++)
  ```
  This resource exhaustion vulnerability in a widely-deployed Intel Bluetooth PCIe driver represents a legitimate security issue warranting CVE assignment.
308a3a8ce8ea4 Bluetooth: hci_core: fix list_for_each_entry_rcu usage
- [sasha] Now, based on my analysis of the commit and the historical context, let me make a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed** - The commit is fixing an incorrect usage of RCU locking (releasing and re-acquiring RCU read lock within `list_for_each_entry_rcu()`), which is a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **The issue is a locking violation, not exploitable** - While the previous commit (c7eaf80bfb0c) introduced a problematic pattern of releasing/reacquiring RCU locks inside the list iteration to avoid a "sleeping while atomic" bug, this created an incorrect RCU usage pattern. The current fix properly addresses this by using `hci_dev_lock()` instead, which is the correct synchronization mechanism.
  3. **Similar non-CVE patterns** - Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 3 (c7eaf80bfb0c) and Commit 4 (ab6ab707a4d0) both deal with RCU locking issues but were marked as "CVE Status: NO"
     - These commits show that RCU locking correctness issues in the Bluetooth subsystem are typically not considered security vulnerabilities
  4. **No exploitable impact** - The commit message and code changes don't indicate any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impacts. It's purely a fix for incorrect RCU usage that could potentially lead to race conditions but not to exploitable security issues.
  5. **Documentation confirms this is a usage error** - The RCU documentation (as seen in rculist.h) indicates that `list_for_each_entry_rcu()` must be "guarded by rcu_read_lock()" - violating this is a programming error that affects correctness, not a security vulnerability.
  The commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (Commits 1 and 2) involve actual use-after-free or memory safety issues where RCU dereferencing happens outside the critical section, which can lead to exploitable conditions. This commit, however, is just fixing an incorrect locking pattern without any demonstrated security impact.
8a3514d348de8 scsi: core: ufs: Fix a hang in the error handler
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with similar commits that were assigned CVEs, my determination is:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It fixes a deadlock condition** - The commit explicitly states it fixes "a hang in the error handler" which is a denial of service vulnerability. The deadlock occurs when the error handler tries to perform runtime resume while UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS is already set.
  2. **The deadlock mechanism is clear**: 
     - The error handler sets UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS flag
     - Then calls ufshcd_err_handling_prepare() which calls ufshcd_rpm_get_sync()
     - Runtime resume needs to send a START_STOP SCSI command to wake the device
     - But ufshcd_queuecommand() returns SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY when UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS is set (line 2986)
     - This creates a circular dependency leading to deadlock
  3. **Impact is significant** - This causes the system to hang with a complete deadlock in the error handler, preventing any error recovery and effectively causing a denial of service for the UFS storage subsystem.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits** - The similar commits shown (CVE Status: YES) also fixed deadlock conditions in the UFS subsystem, particularly:
     - Commit 1 fixed a deadlock where error handler gets stuck waiting for tags
     - Commits 2 & 3 fixed deadlocks in RTC update work
     - Commit 4 fixed a deadlock during RTC update with runtime PM
  5. **The fix is security-relevant** - By moving the UFSHCD_EH_IN_PROGRESS flag setting after ufshcd_rpm_get_sync(), it breaks the circular dependency and prevents the deadlock from occurring.
  This is a classic deadlock vulnerability that can be triggered during error handling scenarios, potentially causing system unavailability.
bdbe0a0f71003 pinctrl: samsung: add gs101 specific eint suspend/resume callbacks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds device-specific suspend/resume callbacks for the gs101 SoC pinctrl driver. The changes are adding new functionality rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
  2. **Hardware-specific implementation**: The commit adds `gs101_pinctrl_suspend()` and `gs101_pinctrl_resume()` functions that handle the hardware differences in the gs101 SoC where:
     - The fltcon1 register doesn't always exist (only for pins 4-7)
     - The fltcon0 offset is variable and uses the new `eint_fltcon_offset` field
  3. **No security boundary violations**: The code changes show proper bounds checking (`if (bank->nr_pins > 4)`) before accessing fltcon1 register, preventing any potential out-of-bounds access.
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commit**: The similar commit that was assigned a CVE (d3692d95cc4d) fixed incorrect offsets (removed erroneous 0x100000 offset) that could cause system crashes and incorrect pin state settings. In contrast, this commit is adding proper handling for hardware variations, not fixing a bug that could lead to security issues.
  5. **Nature of the fix**: While this is marked as a "Fixes:" commit, it's fixing missing functionality rather than a security vulnerability. The original commit (4a8be01a1a7a) added gs101 support but didn't account for the hardware differences in suspend/resume paths.
  The commit is a functional enhancement to properly support hardware-specific behavior during suspend/resume operations, not a security vulnerability fix.
77ac6b742eba0 pinctrl: samsung: add dedicated SoC eint suspend/resume callbacks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Pure refactoring** - The commit is primarily a code refactoring that changes the function signatures and reorganizes the suspend/resume logic into SoC-specific callbacks without changing the actual behavior.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed** - The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It's preparing the codebase for future support of gs101 SoC by making the code more modular.
  3. **No functional changes** - The logic remains the same:
     - For regular Exynos: Still saves/restores the same registers (eint_con, eint_fltcon0, eint_fltcon1, eint_mask)
     - For ExynosAutov920: Still uses eint_con_offset and eint_mask_offset
     - The wakeup handling is just moved to a separate helper function
  4. **Architecture improvement only** - The change improves code organization by:
     - Eliminating conditional checks within functions
     - Creating dedicated suspend/resume callbacks per SoC variant
     - Making it easier to add new SoC support (like gs101)
  5. **No security-sensitive operations affected** - The commit doesn't modify any access control, input validation, memory management, or other security-critical operations.
  This is similar to the reference commits provided which were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they were configuration/support additions or fixes for device tree bindings without actual security implications.
3ade961e97f3b pinctrl: samsung: refactor drvdata suspend & resume callbacks
- [sasha] Let me look at the current commit changes in detail. Based on the provided changes, I can see that:
  1. The commit is refactoring the suspend/resume callbacks in the Samsung pinctrl driver
  2. The main change is moving from per-driver callbacks to per-bank callbacks
  3. The clock enable/disable logic is being moved out of individual bank suspend/resume functions
  Looking at the key changes:
  **Old code pattern:**
  - `exynos_pinctrl_suspend(struct samsung_pinctrl_drv_data *drvdata)` - operates on all banks
  - Each bank function handles its own clock enable/disable
  - Called once for the entire driver
  **New code pattern:**
  - `exynos_pinctrl_suspend(struct samsung_pin_bank *bank)` - operates on a single bank
  - Clock enable/disable is handled at the driver level in `samsung_pinctrl_suspend/resume`
  - Called for each bank individually
  This is a pure refactoring change that:
  1. Does not fix any security vulnerability
  2. Does not change the functional behavior
  3. Only reorganizes the code structure to prepare for future SoC-specific callbacks
  4. Maintains the same suspend/resume logic but with better separation of concerns
  The commit message clearly states this is a "preparatory patch" and "should have no functional impact."
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is a pure refactoring change that reorganizes the suspend/resume callback structure without fixing any security vulnerability or changing functional behavior. The commit simply moves the clock enable/disable logic from individual bank functions to the main suspend/resume handlers and changes the callback signatures to operate on individual banks rather than all banks at once. This is preparatory work to enable SoC-specific callbacks in the future, with no security implications.
adb49732c8c63 tools/power turbostat: Fix AMD package-energy reporting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my decision:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a reporting bug in turbostat, a userspace diagnostic tool, not a kernel security vulnerability. The commit fixes incorrect energy reporting where different packages incorrectly showed the same energy values.
  2. **Diagnostic tool bug**: Turbostat is a power monitoring utility in tools/power/x86/turbostat/ that reads performance counters. The bug causes incorrect reporting of package energy values on multi-package AMD systems when reading RAPL counters via perf instead of MSRs.
  3. **No security impact**: The fix addresses a logic error where physical_core_id values (which are only unique within a package) were being used as domain IDs across multiple packages, causing cores with the same physical_core_id to incorrectly share the same rapl_counter_info_perdomain[] entry. This results in wrong energy readings being displayed but has no security implications.
  4. **Similar commits show no CVE pattern**: The referenced similar commits in the analysis (like "tools/power turbostat: Avoid possible memory corruption due to sparse topology IDs", "tools/power turbostat: Remember global max_die_id", etc.) all have CVE Status: NO, indicating that turbostat bugs are not considered security vulnerabilities.
  The change introduces helper functions `get_rapl_num_domains()` and `get_rapl_domain_id()` to properly calculate system-wide unique domain IDs by considering both package and core IDs, ensuring each core gets its own unique RAPL domain entry.
c50a04f8f45c7 genksyms: Fix enum consts from a reference affecting new values
- [sasha] Now let me analyze if this is a security issue:
  ## Analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Build-time tool only**: genksyms is a build-time tool used to generate symbol version hashes for kernel modules. It runs during kernel compilation, not at runtime.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug only affects the calculation of checksums/hashes for module symbols during the build process. It doesn't introduce any runtime vulnerability or allow privilege escalation.
  3. **Impact is limited to build artifacts**: The issue causes incorrect enumeration constant values to be generated in symbol type files (*.symtypes), which affects module version checking but doesn't compromise system security.
  4. **Similar to other genksyms memory leak fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided (which were marked "CVE Status: NO"), they also fixed bugs in genksyms including memory leaks and incorrect symbol handling. None of these were assigned CVEs because they are build-time issues.
  5. **No exploitable vulnerability**: The bug causes incorrect modversion calculations which could lead to module loading issues or false compatibility warnings, but this cannot be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
  The commit fixes a functional bug in a build tool that affects module symbol versioning accuracy, but it does not introduce or fix any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
12f147ddd6de7 do_change_type(): refuse to operate on unmounted/not ours mounts
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate mount propagation settings on mounts that don't belong to their mount namespace. Specifically:
  1. **Security Impact**: Without the `check_mnt()` validation, a user could change propagation settings (MS_SHARED, MS_PRIVATE, MS_SLAVE, MS_UNBINDABLE) on mounts outside their namespace, potentially:
     - Breaking namespace isolation boundaries
     - Affecting mount behavior in other namespaces
     - Creating unexpected mount relationships that could lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation
  2. **Attack Vector**: The vulnerability allows unprivileged users to call `mount()` with propagation flags on mount points they don't own, bypassing the namespace security model that should restrict such operations.
  3. **Fix Pattern**: The fix adds the missing `check_mnt(mnt)` validation that is consistently used in other mount operations like umount, remount, and move_mount to ensure users can only manipulate mounts within their own namespace.
  4. **Historical Context**: The bug has existed since commit 07b20889e305 ("beginning of the shared-subtree proper") from 2005, making it a long-standing security issue in the mount namespace isolation mechanism.
  The commit clearly fixes a security boundary violation that could be exploited to break container/namespace isolation, warranting CVE assignment.
c28f922c9dcee clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns
- [sasha] Now let me understand the security vulnerability better by examining the exact change in the commit:
  The commit adds:
  ```c
  if (!ns_capable(old_mnt->mnt_ns->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
      return ERR_PTR(-EPERM);
  ```
  This check ensures that the caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the user namespace that owns the mount namespace where the mount to be cloned resides.
  Let me analyze the security implications by looking at how this could be exploited. The function clone_private_mount() creates a private clone of a mount, and overlayfs uses it to access upper and lower directories. Without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check, a user could potentially:
  1. Create an overlayfs mount using directories from a mount they don't have admin rights to
  2. This could bypass mount restrictions that were put in place by a more privileged user
  3. The commit message mentions "clone won't expose something hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo"
  This is a **privilege escalation vulnerability** where an unprivileged user could potentially access filesystem content that should be restricted by mount permissions in a different user namespace.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to bypass mount restrictions by cloning mounts from namespaces where they don't have CAP_SYS_ADMIN. The vulnerability could allow access to filesystem content that should be protected by mount namespace boundaries, constituting a privilege escalation issue. The fix adds a proper capability check to ensure the caller has administrative privileges in the mount's user namespace before allowing the clone operation.
4954346d80fb0 fs: allow clone_private_mount() for a path on real rootfs
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze this:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional regression, not a security vulnerability. The analysis shows:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit db04662e2f4f inadvertently broke mounting overlayfs when the upperdir is on the real rootfs (initramfs). This is a functional regression where overlayfs mount operations fail with "failed to clone upperpath".
  2. **Permission check modification**: The fix changes the permission check logic in `clone_private_mount()` from:
     - Old: Required either having a parent mount OR being in an anonymous namespace
     - New: Allows mounts from current namespace (`check_mnt()`) OR anonymous namespace roots
  3. **No security boundary crossing**: The modification doesn't weaken security - it restores previous functionality while maintaining security checks:
     - Still checks for mount loops via `check_for_nsfs_mounts()`
     - Still validates the mount is not unbindable
     - Still checks for locked children
     - The `check_mnt()` function verifies the mount belongs to the current namespace
  4. **Impact is availability, not security**: Users cannot mount overlayfs with upperdir on initramfs, which is a denial of functionality, not a security vulnerability that allows privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts.
  This is similar to the reference commits shown which fix functional issues in the filesystem layer without security implications.
d8cc0362f918d fix propagation graph breakage by MOVE_MOUNT_SET_GROUP move_mount(2)
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my decision:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossing**: The bug requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in both the source and target mount namespaces (as shown in the do_set_group() function checks). This is a highly privileged operation that only root or namespace-privileged processes can perform.
  2. **Data Structure Corruption, Not Exploitable**: While the bug breaks internal kernel data structure invariants (specifically the mount propagation graph ordering), there's no evidence this can be exploited for:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Memory corruption
  3. **Logic Bug, Not Memory Safety**: The fix changes from `list_add(&to->mnt_slave, &m->mnt_slave_list)` to `list_add(&to->mnt_slave, &from->mnt_slave)`. This is inserting the mount in the wrong position in a linked list - it doesn't cause memory corruption, use-after-free, or buffer overflows.
  4. **Limited Impact**: The commit message states this "breaks assertions on ->mnt_share/->mnt_slave" and violates documented invariants for propagation graph iterators. While this could cause incorrect behavior in mount propagation, it doesn't cross security boundaries.
  5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involve:
     - Race conditions that can lead to use-after-free or filesystem shutdown (Similar Commit 1 & 2)
     - Race conditions in memory allocation (Similar Commit 4)
     
     This commit is more similar to Commit 3 (CVE Status: NO) which fixes data structure management without security implications.
  The bug is a correctness issue in mount propagation graph management that requires high privileges to trigger and doesn't lead to exploitable security vulnerabilities.
bab77c0d191e2 finish_automount(): don't leak MNT_LOCKED from parent to child
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: While the commit fixes MNT_LOCKED being incorrectly inherited by automounts, the commit message explicitly states that this protection is "pointless" for automounts because they are usually expirable - they automatically unmount after a period of inactivity, making any MNT_LOCKED protection ineffective.
  2. **Original Design Intent**: The commit message clarifies that MNT_LOCKED was always intended to protect internal mountpoints within a subtree copied across userns boundaries, not the mountpoint where the tree is attached. The bug was that automounts were incorrectly inheriting this flag.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug doesn't allow unprivileged users to gain additional privileges or access resources they shouldn't. It's a correctness issue where automounts incorrectly inherit a restriction flag that doesn't provide meaningful security for expirable mounts.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at similar commit 3 (fs: kill MNT_ONRB) which was marked as "CVE Status: NO", it also dealt with mount flag handling issues without security implications.
  5. **Code Change Impact**: The fix simply adds MNT_LOCKED to MNT_INTERNAL_FLAGS, ensuring it gets stripped in do_add_mount() along with other internal flags. This is a cleanup that aligns the behavior with the original security model's intent.
  The bug is more of a functional issue where automounts incorrectly inherit restrictions that don't make sense for their use case, rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
101f2bbab5411 fs: convert mount flags to enum
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed**: The commit is purely a code refactoring that converts preprocessor macro definitions (#define) to an enum. The actual flag values remain identical (e.g., MNT_NOSUID = 0x01, MNT_NODEV = 0x02, etc.).
  2. **No functional changes**: The code changes are cosmetic and do not alter any kernel behavior. Mount flags continue to work exactly as before, with the same values and semantics.
  3. **Purpose is debugging support**: The commit message explicitly states this change is to help debuggers read mount flag definitions from debuginfo. This is a developer quality-of-life improvement, not a security fix.
  4. **No security-sensitive components affected**: While mount flags like MNT_NOSUID, MNT_NODEV, and MNT_NOEXEC are security-relevant features, this commit doesn't change how they work or fix any vulnerabilities in their implementation.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: The provided similar commits show that simple code reorganization (like converting defines to enums or cleaning up trace macros) are not assigned CVEs, as they don't address security issues.
  The commit is a pure refactoring to improve debugger support, with no security implications whatsoever.
5f31c549382bc path_overmount(): avoid false negatives
- [sasha] Let me understand the referenced bug from the Referenced Fixes commits in the prompt:
  Based on my analysis of the commit and its context:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Security-relevant race condition**: The commit fixes a race condition in `path_overmounted()` that can lead to false negatives. This function is used to check if a path has another mount on top of it, which is a critical security check.
  2. **Impact on security boundaries**: The false negatives can occur when:
     - Mounts are being unhashed outside of namespace_sem (during lazy unmount cleanup)
     - An unrelated mount is removed from the hash chain during traversal
     - This leads to `__lookup_mnt()` incorrectly returning NULL when a mount actually exists
  3. **Security implications**: 
     - In `finish_automount()` (line 3924), a false negative would allow mounting when it shouldn't be allowed
     - In `can_move_mount_beneath()` (line 3523), it could bypass the check that prevents creating shadow mounts
     - Both cases can lead to unexpected mount configurations that could potentially be exploited
  4. **Concrete vulnerability**: The race allows bypassing checks that are meant to prevent certain mount operations. An attacker could potentially exploit this timing window to create mount configurations that should be prohibited.
  5. **Pattern matching with CVE-assigned commits**: Similar to the referenced CVE-assigned commits that fix races in mount handling (like the MNT_TREE_BENEATH handling races), this commit fixes a race that affects mount security checks.
  The fix properly addresses the race by:
  - Sampling the seqlock before checking
  - Rechecking under exclusive lock if a retry is needed
  - Ensuring the result is consistent and reliable
  This prevents the false negatives that could lead to security policy bypasses in mount operations.
1f282cdc1d219 fs/fhandle.c: fix a race in call of has_locked_children()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The commit fixes a race condition in the `has_locked_children()` function when called from `may_decode_fh()` without holding proper locks. The commit message explicitly states this is an "oopsable race", meaning it can cause a kernel crash.
  Key security-relevant aspects:
  1. **User-triggerable crash**: The vulnerable code path is reachable from userspace via the `open_by_handle_at()` system call, allowing unprivileged users to potentially trigger the race condition.
  2. **Race condition in mount operations**: The `has_locked_children()` function iterates through the `mnt->mnt_mounts` list without holding the `mount_lock`, which can lead to:
     - Use-after-free if mounts are removed during iteration
     - List corruption if the list is modified concurrently
     - Kernel oops/crash
  3. **Clear security fix**: The patch adds proper locking by creating a wrapper that calls `__has_locked_children()` under `read_seqlock_excl(&mount_lock)`, preventing concurrent modifications during list traversal.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the provided similar commits which all fix race conditions in filesystem/mount operations and were assigned CVEs.
  The vulnerability allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) through a race condition in the mount subsystem.
334d7c4fb60cf iov_iter: use iov_offset for length calculation in iov_iter_aligned_bvec
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this alignment bug has security implications:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Memory Safety Issue**: The bug in `iov_iter_aligned_bvec()` fails to subtract the offset (`skip`) when calculating length, causing incorrect alignment validation. The commit message explicitly states this could lead to "mapping wrong physical address length and proceeding with IO rather than failing."
  2. **Security Impact**: When alignment checks incorrectly pass for unaligned I/O operations:
     - The system may read/write to unintended memory locations
     - This could lead to data corruption or information disclosure
     - The bug allows I/O operations that violate device alignment requirements (e.g., 512-byte alignment for certain block devices)
  3. **Exploitability**: The issue is:
     - Reproducible from userspace using io_uring with fixed buffers
     - Triggered when I/O crosses page boundaries with specific offset conditions
     - Can be reliably reproduced using the liburing test suite
  4. **Attack Scenario**: An attacker could craft specific I/O requests with:
     - Fixed buffers that span page boundaries
     - Specific offsets that trigger the miscalculation
     - Target devices with strict alignment requirements (512-byte LBA devices)
  The code change shows the bug clearly:
  ```diff
  -		size_t len = bvec->bv_len;
  +		size_t len = bvec->bv_len - skip;
  ```
  This missing offset subtraction means the first bio_vec in an iterator with non-zero offset would have its length incorrectly calculated, potentially allowing operations on memory beyond the intended boundaries.
bae071aa7bcd0 ASoC: ti: omap-hdmi: Re-add dai_link->platform to fix card init
- [sasha] Looking at the patterns and understanding the issue:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug that causes audio playback to fail with `-EINVAL` (Invalid argument), but it does not create any security vulnerability. The error occurs when trying to open the audio device for playback.
  2. **No security impact**: The missing `dai_link->platform` component causes:
     - Audio playback to fail at runtime when using audio tools
     - The card initialization to be incomplete
     - User-space operations to return error code -22 (EINVAL)
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This commit follows the exact same pattern as Similar Commit 1 (atmel-classd) and Similar Commit 4 (loongson), both of which were marked "CVE Status: NO". They all:
     - Fix missing platform component in dai_link
     - Cause runtime audio playback failures
     - Are functional bugs, not security issues
  4. **No exploitation potential**: The bug simply prevents audio functionality from working correctly. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Buffer overflow
     - Access control bypass
  5. **Clear functional fix**: The code change allocates space for 2 components instead of 1, properly assigns the platform component, and restores functionality. This is a straightforward bug fix for broken audio functionality.
  The commit is purely a functional fix to restore audio playback capability that was broken by the removal of the platform component in commit 3b0db249cf8f.
93e246b6769bd ASoC: Intel: avs: Verify content returned by parse_int_array()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It fixes a null pointer dereference vulnerability**: The code originally accessed `array[1]` without checking if `num_elems` (which is `*array`) is at least 1. If `num_elems` is 0, accessing `array[1]` results in an out-of-bounds access and potential null pointer dereference.
  2. **The vulnerability is in a user-accessible interface**: The bug is in `trace_control_write()`, which is exposed through debugfs at `/sys/kernel/debug/avs/trace_control`. Any user with access to this debugfs file could trigger the vulnerability by writing malformed data.
  3. **Clear security impact**: The vulnerability allows local users to cause a kernel crash (denial of service) by writing specially crafted input to the debugfs file. The input would need to result in `parse_int_array_user()` returning an array where the first element (count) is 0.
  4. **Similar pattern to CVE-assigned commits**: Like the similar commits shown (CVE-assigned null pointer dereferences in ASoC Intel code), this fixes a missing validation check that could lead to system instability.
  The fix adds proper validation by checking if `num_elems` is 0 before attempting to access `array[1]`, preventing the out-of-bounds access that could cause a kernel crash.
5f342aeee2724 ASoC: Intel: avs: Verify kcalloc() status when setting constraints
- [sasha] Looking at the code flow and the fix:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The original code in `avs_path_set_constraint()` calls `kcalloc()` three times to allocate memory arrays but doesn't check if the allocations succeeded. The fix adds a check: `if (!rlist || !clist || !slist) return -ENOMEM;`
  2. **Impact analysis**:
     - This is a missing error check for memory allocation failure
     - If `kcalloc()` fails (returns NULL), the code would continue and later dereference the NULL pointers when accessing `rlist[i]`, `clist[i]`, or `slist[i]` at lines 166-168
     - This would cause a kernel NULL pointer dereference
  3. **Security implications**:
     - Memory allocation failures in kernel are typically due to legitimate resource exhaustion
     - This occurs in audio driver initialization path (`avs_dai_startup` → `avs_hw_constraints_init` → `avs_path_set_constraint`)
     - No privilege escalation or data disclosure potential
     - At worst, this would cause a kernel oops/crash during audio device initialization
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - All the similar commits shown (prefixing members, fixing init-config parsing, route override, ASRC module init, ssm4567 route checks) were marked as "CVE Status: NO"
     - These were all bug fixes without security implications
  5. **Exploitability**:
     - Triggering memory allocation failure is difficult for unprivileged users
     - This only affects Intel AVS audio driver users
     - The crash would occur during audio device setup, not during normal operation
  This is a robustness/reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability. The bug could cause a system crash under memory pressure, but it doesn't provide any attack vector for malicious users to exploit.
9e3285be55e6c ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix paths in MODULE_FIRMWARE hints
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit fixes incorrect firmware paths in MODULE_FIRMWARE declarations. MODULE_FIRMWARE is purely informational metadata that tells userspace tools (like modinfo, dracut, mkinitrd) which firmware files a module might need. It doesn't affect the actual firmware loading process.
  2. **No Runtime Impact**: Looking at the code in `loader.c`, the actual firmware loading uses `AVS_ROOT_DIR` defined as `"intel/avs"` and constructs paths like `"%s/%s/%s", AVS_ROOT_DIR, spec->name, AVS_BASEFW_FILENAME`. The MODULE_FIRMWARE declarations were incorrectly showing paths like `"intel/skl/dsp_basefw.bin"` instead of `"intel/avs/skl/dsp_basefw.bin"`, but this only affects module metadata, not the runtime behavior.
  3. **Metadata Only**: MODULE_FIRMWARE expands to MODULE_INFO(firmware, ...) which just adds a string to the `.modinfo` section of the module. This is used by:
     - `modinfo` command to show firmware dependencies
     - Distribution tools to include necessary firmware in initramfs
     - Documentation purposes
  4. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The incorrect paths would at worst cause firmware files to not be included in initramfs by automated tools, leading to a functional issue (driver fails to load firmware), not a security issue.
  This is similar to the reference commits shown, which are all marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they fix functional issues in the Intel AVS audio driver but don't address security vulnerabilities.
75f3c607b1fa1 ASoC: Intel: avs: Relocate DSP status registers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It's a refactoring/architectural change**: The commit is relocating the DSP status register offset from the SRAM specification structure to the Host-IPC descriptor structure. This is purely an internal code reorganization to better align with ACE platform specifications.
  2. **No security vulnerability is being fixed**: The code changes show:
     - Moving `rom_status_offset` from `avs_sram_spec` to `avs_hipc_spec` as `sts_offset`
     - Updating references from `spec->sram->rom_status_offset` to `spec->hipc->sts_offset`
     - Updating the `AVS_FW_REG_BASE` macro to use the new location
  3. **No functional behavior change**: The actual register addresses and values remain the same. For example:
     - SKL uses `SKL_ADSP_SRAM_BASE_OFFSET` (0x8000)
     - APL uses `APL_ADSP_SRAM_BASE_OFFSET` (0x80000)
     These values are simply being assigned to the new `sts_offset` field instead of `rom_status_offset`.
  4. **No security-relevant patterns**: The changes don't involve:
     - Buffer overflow fixes
     - Access control changes
     - Input validation improvements
     - Memory corruption fixes
     - Race condition fixes
     - Privilege escalation fixes
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This commit follows the same pattern as Similar Commit 1, which was marked as "CVE Status: NO" - both are architectural refactoring changes to improve code organization and support for different platform variants.
  This is a code maintenance/refactoring commit to improve code structure and prepare for ACE platform support, not a security fix.
b9a3ec6049930 ASoC: Intel: avs: Read HW capabilities when possible
- [sasha] Let me analyze the actual code changes provided in the prompt more carefully:
  **NO**
  This commit does not introduce security vulnerabilities that warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Safe Value Reading**: The commit reads `slcount` from hardware registers using `FIELD_GET(AZX_ML_HDA_LCAP_SLCOUNT, hlink->lcaps) + 1`. The FIELD_GET macro safely extracts a bitfield value, and adding 1 is a standard operation to convert from 0-based to 1-based counting.
  2. **Existing Trust Model**: The code already trusts hardware registers - it's reading from `bus->mlcap` registers which are part of the HD Audio controller's memory-mapped I/O space. This isn't introducing a new trust boundary.
  3. **Conditional Enhancement**: The new code in `avs_dsp_alloc_resources()` only uses hardware values when the ALTHDA platform attribute is set, indicating newer hardware with this capability. It's a conditional enhancement, not a vulnerability.
  4. **No Memory Safety Issues**: The `slcount` field is simply stored in the structure and the `ctrl_count` is assigned from `link->slcount`. There's no dynamic memory allocation based on these values in the shown code.
  5. **Standard Hardware Capability Discovery**: Reading capabilities from hardware registers is a standard practice in device drivers. Modern hardware often exposes its capabilities through registers, which is more reliable than hardcoding or relying solely on firmware.
  The similar commits shown (all marked "CVE Status: NO") are documentation updates, helper function additions, and board configuration changes - none of which are security fixes. This commit follows the same pattern of being a feature enhancement rather than a security fix.
acd2563f30886 ASoC: Intel: avs: Ignore Vendor-space manipulation for ACE
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of both the commit and the kernel tree context, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Hardware Compatibility, Not Security**: This commit adds support for new Intel ACE (Audio Compute Engine) hardware by preventing access to vendor-specific registers that don't exist on ACE platforms (MeteorLake onward). The registers being conditionally accessed are:
     - Power Gating Control (PGCTL)
     - Clock Gating Control (CGCTL)  
     - Vendor Specific EM2 register (L1SEN and DUM bits)
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The code changes show this is purely about hardware compatibility:
     - Adds `AVS_PLATATTR_ACE` platform attribute
     - Adds conditional checks `if (!avs_platattr_test(adev, ACE))` before register accesses
     - Simply skips register manipulation on ACE hardware where these registers don't exist
  3. **No Security Impact**: The registers being accessed control:
     - Power management features (power/clock gating)
     - L1 power state transitions
     - Audio capture stream position reporting correction (DUM bit)
     
     None of these have security implications - they are performance and power optimization features.
  4. **Proactive Hardware Enablement**: This is a forward-looking change to support newer Intel hardware, not a fix for any existing vulnerability. Accessing non-existent registers would cause system instability or crashes, not security issues like privilege escalation or memory corruption.
  5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: Like the reference commits provided (which were all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this commit is making architectural adjustments for hardware compatibility rather than fixing security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply ensures the driver doesn't try to manipulate hardware features that don't exist on newer ACE-based Intel audio platforms.
2f78724d4f0c6 ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix possible null-ptr-deref when initing hw
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The analysis shows:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The original code in `avs_hw_constraints_init()` calls `avs_dai_find_path_template()` at line 100 and passes the result directly to `avs_path_set_constraint()` at line 101 without checking if it's NULL.
  2. **Function can return NULL**: Looking at `avs_dai_find_path_template()`, it can return NULL in two cases:
     - When `list_first_entry_or_null()` returns NULL (line 56)
     - When `dw->priv` is NULL (line 62)
  3. **Security impact**: The unchecked NULL pointer would be dereferenced inside `avs_path_set_constraint()`, causing a kernel crash. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability that could be triggered by userspace through ALSA/ASoC interfaces.
  4. **Pattern matches CVE commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown:
     - Commit 1 & 2: Fix null-ptr-deref by adding NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()`
     - Commit 3 & 4: Fix null-ptr-deref by checking `num_codecs` before dereferencing
     - Commit 5: Fix null-ptr-deref in `acp_i2s_set_tdm_slot`
  5. **Fix validates the issue**: The fix removes the redundant call to `avs_dai_find_path_template()` in `avs_hw_constraints_init()` and uses `data->template` instead, which is already validated in `avs_dai_startup()` (lines 127-132) before `avs_hw_constraints_init()` is called.
347c8d6db7c9d ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix PPLCxFMT calculation
- [sasha] Now, based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes incorrect format calculations when setting up audio streams where the Front-End (FE) and Back-End (BE) formats differ.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The issue affects audio format configuration in Intel AVS (Audio Voice Speech) driver. Using incorrect format values would result in:
     - Audio playback/capture issues
     - Incorrect audio format handling
     - Potential audio quality problems or stream failures
  3. **No security implications**: The code changes show:
     - Switching from using `runtime->format`, `runtime->channels`, and `runtime->rate` (from the FE runtime)
     - To using `params_format(p)`, `params_channels(p)`, and `params_rate(p)` (from BE's hw_params)
     - This is purely about using the correct parameters for hardware configuration
  4. **No privilege escalation or memory safety issues**: The fix doesn't address:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Any form of security boundary violation
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: The reference commits provided all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar audio driver fixes (firmware versions, integer overflow prevention, channel mapping, timing calculations) - none of which were security vulnerabilities.
  This is a standard bug fix for incorrect parameter usage in audio stream setup, affecting functionality but not security.
716643786f140 ASoC: Intel: avs: PCM operations for LNL-based platforms
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my security assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not introduce any security vulnerabilities that warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of changes**: The commit refactors PCM operations for LNL (LunarLake) platforms to unify HDAudio Link DMA usage across different transfer types. It's primarily a code reorganization and feature enhancement.
  2. **No security-sensitive operations**: The changes involve:
     - Adding a `link` pointer to the `avs_dma_data` structure
     - Refactoring startup/shutdown functions to handle different link types
     - Creating wrapper functions (`__avs_dai_hda_be_startup`, `avs_dai_i2shda_be_startup`, `avs_dai_dmichda_be_startup`)
     - No changes to memory allocation, bounds checking, or access control
  3. **Error handling preserved**: The commit maintains existing error checking patterns:
     - NULL checks for link pointers (`if (!link) return -EINVAL;`)
     - Proper cleanup in shutdown functions
     - No introduction of unchecked operations
  4. **No exploitable conditions**: The changes don't introduce:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Use-after-free conditions
     - Race conditions
     - Privilege escalation opportunities
     - Information leaks
  5. **Architecture-specific audio driver**: This is a platform-specific audio driver change that requires specific hardware (Intel LunarLake) and doesn't affect core kernel security boundaries.
  The commit is a functional enhancement to support new hardware platforms and maintain compatibility across different Intel audio architectures, not a security fix.
318c9eef63dd3 ALSA: hda: Allow to fetch hlink by ID
- [sasha] The new function doesn't exist yet in the kernel tree, so let me analyze what the commit adds based on the changes shown:
  Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is a feature enhancement that adds new functionality to the Intel HD Audio driver infrastructure. Specifically:
  1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit adds support for fetching HDA links by ID, which is needed for newer Intel platforms (starting with LNL/Lunar Lake) that support non-HDAudio transfer types like I2S. This is purely additive functionality.
  2. **No Security Fixes**: The code changes show:
     - Addition of a new `id` field to the `hdac_ext_link` structure
     - Addition of helper macros `hdac_ext_link_alt()` and `hdac_ext_link_ofls()`
     - A new function `snd_hdac_ext_bus_get_hlink_by_id()` that searches for links by ID
     - Reading of the LEPTR register to populate the ID field when the ALT bit is set
  3. **No Vulnerability Patterns**: The commit does not exhibit any of the common security vulnerability patterns:
     - No buffer overflow fixes
     - No memory leak fixes
     - No access control changes
     - No input validation improvements
     - No race condition fixes
     - No privilege escalation fixes
  4. **Safe Implementation**: The new function follows the same pattern as existing functions like `snd_hdac_ext_bus_get_hlink_by_addr()` and simply iterates through a list to find a matching ID. There are no security-sensitive operations involved.
  5. **Purpose**: The commit message clearly states this is to support new hardware capabilities for alternative link types (like I2S with ID 0xC0) on newer Intel platforms, not to fix any existing security issues.
  This is a straightforward feature addition to support new hardware capabilities and does not warrant a CVE assignment.
9ad1f3cd0d604 ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix deadlock when the failing IPC is SET_D0IX
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code, here's my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a deadlock issue that occurs in a specific error handling path when the SET_D0IX IPC (Inter-Process Communication) message fails. The deadlock happens because:
     - The `avs_dsp_d0ix_work` function calls `avs_dsp_set_d0ix()`
     - If this IPC fails, it triggers `avs_dsp_exception_caught()`
     - `avs_dsp_exception_caught()` calls `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&ipc->d0ix_work)`
     - This creates a deadlock because the work item is trying to cancel itself synchronously
  2. **Security Impact Analysis**:
     - This is a **reliability/availability issue**, not a security vulnerability
     - The deadlock only occurs during error recovery when the DSP firmware encounters an exception
     - It doesn't allow privilege escalation, memory corruption, or unauthorized access
     - The system would hang in this specific error path, which is a DoS-like condition but requires the DSP to already be in a failing state
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar commit 3 (rt5645 deadlock) received a CVE because it was a general deadlock that could be triggered during normal jack detection operations
     - This commit's deadlock only occurs in an already-failing error recovery path
     - The other "NO CVE" commits (1, 2, 4, 5) were also fixing lock-related issues but in non-security contexts
  4. **Fix details**: The fix simply adds a check `if (current_work() != &ipc->d0ix_work.work)` to avoid the self-cancellation deadlock, which is a proper defensive programming fix for a corner case.
  The deadlock is a quality/reliability issue in error handling code, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
ff0045de4ee02 ASoC: codecs: hda: Fix RPM usage count underflow
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this commit against similar commits to determine if it should get a CVE.
  **Analysis:**
  The commit fixes an RPM (Runtime Power Management) usage count underflow bug in the ASoC HD-Audio codec driver. Here's the security analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is an RPM usage count underflow that occurs when `hda_codec_probe_complete()` fails. The function incorrectly performs RPM put operations in its error path, even though these operations are already handled by the calling functions.
  2. **Code flow analysis**:
     - In `hda_codec_probe_complete()`, when `snd_hda_codec_build_controls()` fails, the code jumps to the `out:` label
     - At the `out:` label, it performs `pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(bus->dev)`
     - However, the callers already handle RPM cleanup:
       - For `hda_codec_probe()`: on error, it already does `pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()` at line 266
       - For `avs_card_late_probe()`: if it fails, ASoC framework triggers cleanup via `hda_codec_remove()`
  3. **Security implications**:
     - This is a reference counting bug that leads to underflow
     - RPM usage count underflow can cause incorrect power management state
     - This could potentially lead to:
       - System instability
       - Incorrect power state management
       - Potential denial of service if the driver misbehaves due to incorrect power state
     - The bug is in error handling paths, making it less likely to be triggered in normal operation
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES): Memory leak fix - clear security issue with resource exhaustion potential
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES): Null pointer dereference fix - clear security issue that can cause crashes
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES): Memory leak fix - same as commit 1
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: NO): Error handling path improvements without security implications
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: NO): Error handling path cleanup without security implications
  5. **Key differences from CVE-assigned commits**:
     - The CVE-assigned commits fix clear security vulnerabilities (memory leaks, null pointer dereferences)
     - This commit fixes a reference counting issue that, while it could cause system issues, is less directly exploitable
     - The impact is limited to power management state corruption rather than memory corruption or crashes
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a real bug (RPM usage count underflow), the security impact is limited compared to the similar commits that received CVEs. The bug:
  - Occurs only in error handling paths (when control creation fails)
  - Affects power management state rather than causing memory corruption or crashes
  - Is not easily exploitable for malicious purposes
  - Has limited impact on system security
  The fix is a correctness issue that prevents potential power management misbehavior, but does not rise to the level of a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
7831003165d37 scsi: ufs: qcom: Prevent calling phy_exit() before phy_init()
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. The PHY framework requires:
  1. `phy_init()` must be called before `phy_power_on()`
  2. `phy_power_off()` must be called before `phy_exit()`
  The sequence should be: `phy_init() -> phy_power_on() -> phy_power_off() -> phy_exit()`
  The issue in commit 7bac65687510 was that when `phy->power_count` is non-zero (meaning the PHY is already powered on), it would call:
  ```c
  phy_power_off(phy);
  phy_exit(phy);
  ```
  But this means that `phy_init()` was never called for this power-on state, yet `phy_exit()` is being called. This creates an imbalance in the init/exit reference counting.
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a driver correctness issue that causes a warning message and incorrect reference counting in the PHY framework. The commit message clearly states it "avoid[s] abnormal power count and the following warning during boot up."
  2. **Only affects proper operation, not security**: The issue manifests as:
     - A warning message: "phy_power_on was called before phy_init"
     - Incorrect reference counting in the PHY subsystem
     - No security boundary violations, privilege escalations, or data exposure
  3. **Limited impact**: The issue only occurs in specific scenarios (resume from suspend) and results in a warning and potentially incorrect PHY state management, but does not create exploitable conditions.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (with CVE Status: NO) deal with PHY initialization/power management sequences and driver correctness issues, none of which were assigned CVEs.
  The change simply removes the incorrect `phy_exit()` call to maintain proper init/exit balance when the PHY is already powered on, ensuring the correct sequence of PHY operations.
8c5bcb3daeef9 scsi: ufs: qcom: Map devfreq OPP freq to UniPro Core Clock freq
- [sasha] Let me focus on analyzing the code changes themselves. The key points are:
  1. The commit fixes a functional issue where the `ufs_qcom_freq_to_gear_speed()` function incorrectly assumes that the devfreq OPP frequency directly corresponds to the UniPro core clock frequency.
  2. The fix adds `ufs_qcom_opp_freq_to_clk_freq()` to properly map OPP frequencies to actual clock frequencies.
  3. The `ufs_qcom_set_core_clk_ctrl()` function is modified to handle both scale-up and scale-down scenarios differently, and to use the proper frequency mapping when PM OPP is used.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The issue is a clock frequency mapping error that causes incorrect gear speed calculations. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The incorrect frequency mapping could lead to suboptimal performance or potentially device malfunction, but there's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service that could be exploited
     - Access control bypass
  3. **Hardware-specific driver issue**: This affects the Qualcomm UFS driver's clock frequency handling, which is a hardware-specific implementation detail that doesn't expose any attack surface.
  4. **Similar commits precedent**: The similar commits shown (like the MSM8996 UFS clock frequency fixes) were also not assigned CVEs because they addressed functional issues in hardware drivers rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit fixes a legitimate bug where certain platforms may have different devfreq OPP frequencies than UniPro core clock frequencies, but this misconfiguration doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability.
663d0c19f3acc scsi: ufs: qcom: Check gear against max gear in vop freq_to_gear()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The issue is a functional bug that could cause the UFS driver to attempt configuring a gear speed higher than what was negotiated between the host and device. While this could lead to device communication errors or system instability, it does not constitute a security vulnerability because:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The bug doesn't allow privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or bypass of security controls
  2. **Requires privileged access**: Triggering this issue requires control over UFS clock frequency scaling, which typically requires root privileges
  3. **Impact is operational, not security-related**: The worst-case scenario is device malfunction or system instability, not data exposure or unauthorized access
  4. **No memory corruption**: The code change simply adds a bounds check using `min_t()` to ensure the returned gear doesn't exceed the negotiated maximum - there's no buffer overflow or memory safety issue
  The fix properly constrains the gear value to stay within negotiated limits, preventing potential device communication issues, but this is a reliability/quality fix rather than a security fix.
61a74ad254628 riscv: misaligned: fix sleeping function called during misaligned access handling
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have enough information to make a definitive assessment.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a kernel programming correctness issue. The bug is about calling a sleeping function (`copy_from_user`) in atomic context (with interrupts disabled), which violates kernel programming rules but doesn't create a security hole.
  2. **No privilege escalation or information disclosure**: Unlike the original commits it fixes (b686ecdeacf6 and 441381506ba7), which did have security implications by allowing userspace to access kernel memory, this commit simply fixes the incorrect use of sleeping functions in atomic context.
  3. **The security boundary remains intact**: Both `copy_from_user()` and `copy_from_user_nofault()` perform the same security checks (via `__access_ok()`). The only difference is that the `_nofault` variant uses `pagefault_disable()` to prevent sleeping on page faults, making it safe to use in atomic contexts.
  4. **Similar to non-security commits in the examples**: This is more similar to the "NO" examples provided, such as "riscv: remove unused functions" or "riscv: Fix set up of cpu hotplug callbacks", which are bug fixes but not security vulnerabilities.
  The commit message clearly indicates this is fixing a "sleeping function called from invalid context" bug report, which is a kernel stability/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. While the original commits (b686ecdeacf6 and 441381506ba7) did fix real security issues, this follow-up commit is merely correcting the implementation to work properly in interrupt context.
69a58ef4fa777 drm/xe/pxp: Clarify PXP queue creation behavior if PXP is not ready
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on what I can see from the commit message and diff provided:
  **Analysis:**
  Based on the commit message and code changes, this commit:
  1. **Changes error return codes** - The commit modifies how error codes are returned when PXP is not ready:
     - Previously: Always returned `-EBUSY` regardless of the error
     - Now: Returns `-EIO` for "failed to init" and `-EBUSY` for "not ready"
  2. **Code change details**:
     - Replaces `if (!pxp_prerequisites_done(pxp))` with `ret = xe_pxp_get_readiness_status(pxp)`
     - Uses the return value to distinguish between different error states
     - Returns `-EBUSY` when ret == 0 (in progress) and propagates the error when ret < 0
  3. **No security vulnerability introduced**:
     - This is purely a clarification of error codes
     - No new attack vectors are introduced
     - No access control changes
     - No memory safety issues
     - No privilege escalation possibilities
     - The change is cosmetic and improves API clarity
  4. **Impact**:
     - Only affects the specific error code returned in a corner case
     - As noted in the commit message, this corner case behavior "was not clearly spec'd, so no one should have been relying on it"
     - Mesa (the only known userspace) doesn't rely on this behavior
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a minor API clarification that changes error return codes to be more descriptive. The change does not introduce any security vulnerabilities - it merely distinguishes between two different error states that were previously both reported as `-EBUSY`. This is a quality improvement for error reporting, not a security fix.
6bf4d5649230c drm/xe/pxp: Use the correct define in the set_property_funcs array
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the analysis. Looking at the defines:
  ```
  #define DRM_XE_GEM_CREATE_EXTENSION_SET_PROPERTY    0
  #define   DRM_XE_GEM_CREATE_SET_PROPERTY_PXP_TYPE  0
  ```
  Both defines are indeed 0, which confirms the commit message's statement that "They're both zero, so no functional issue."
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a code correctness issue where the wrong symbolic constant was used as an array index in `gem_create_set_property_funcs[]`. However, since both `DRM_XE_GEM_CREATE_EXTENSION_SET_PROPERTY` and `DRM_XE_GEM_CREATE_SET_PROPERTY_PXP_TYPE` have the value 0, the code functioned correctly despite using the wrong constant. This is purely a maintainability fix to use the semantically correct define, with no security implications or exploitable behavior.
5cc3325584c42 drm/xe: Rework eviction rejection of bound external bos
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This commit is fixing a performance/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. The changes are reworking how buffer object evictions are handled to prevent TTM warnings, but there's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond normal resource exhaustion
  2. **Code Changes Analysis**: 
     - The commit removes the eviction rejection logic from `xe_bo_move()` that was checking if a BO was bound to the current VM
     - It implements a new `xe_bo_eviction_valuable()` callback that uses a "validating" task tracking mechanism
     - The new approach uses `xe_vm_set_validating()`/`xe_vm_clear_validating()` to track when a VM is actively validating BOs
  3. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a rework of an overly aggressive eviction prevention mechanism that was causing TTM warnings. The original commit (0af944f0e308) was too restrictive in preventing evictions, and this commit provides a more nuanced approach using TTM's `eviction_valuable()` callback.
  4. **Impact**: The worst-case scenario appears to be performance degradation or TTM warnings, not any security-relevant impact. The commit message explicitly states it's to avoid "getting an eviction failure warning from TTM."
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the eviction-related changes in DRM drivers have been assigned CVEs. They are all performance optimizations or bug fixes for proper memory management.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for proper GPU memory management but does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities that would warrant a CVE assignment.
2182f358fb138 drm/xe/vsec: fix CONFIG_INTEL_VSEC dependency
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the issue. The commit message explains there's a build failure when:
  - XE driver is built-in (=y)
  - INTEL_VSEC is built as a module (=m)
  This causes undefined reference to `intel_vsec_register` because built-in code cannot link to symbols from loadable modules.
  The fix does two things:
  1. Adds `depends on INTEL_VSEC || !INTEL_VSEC` - this ensures XE can only be built-in if INTEL_VSEC is also built-in or not enabled at all
  2. Replaces `select X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES` with `depends on X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES` to avoid circular dependency
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment because:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a build/link-time configuration issue, not a runtime security vulnerability. The issue prevents the kernel from building successfully in certain configurations, but does not introduce any security weaknesses.
  2. **Build Configuration Issue**: The problem is a circular dependency and undefined symbol reference that occurs during kernel compilation when specific Kconfig options are selected. This is a development/build issue, not a security issue.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: There is no way for an attacker to exploit this issue since it prevents the kernel from building in the problematic configuration. A kernel that fails to link cannot be deployed or run.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (which all have CVE Status: NO), they deal with hardware workarounds, driver fixes, and configuration issues - none of which are security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply fixes a Kconfig dependency issue to ensure proper linking between kernel modules, which is a standard build system fix rather than a security fix.
8cf8cde41ad01 drm/xe/vm: move xe_svm_init() earlier
- [sasha] This is perfect. The issue is clear now. Let me trace the problem:
  1. `xe_vm_create()` allocates the VM structure with `kzalloc()`, so `vm->svm.gpusvm` fields are zero-initialized
  2. In the original code, `xe_svm_init()` was called late in the creation process
  3. If an error occurred before `xe_svm_init()` but after the VM was allocated, the error path would call `xe_vm_close_and_put()`
  4. `xe_vm_close_and_put()` checks `if (xe_vm_in_fault_mode(vm))` and calls `xe_svm_fini(vm)`
  5. `xe_svm_fini()` calls `drm_gpusvm_fini(&vm->svm.gpusvm)` 
  6. `drm_gpusvm_fini()` dereferences fields like `gpusvm->mm` which would be NULL, causing a NULL pointer dereference
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The bug causes a NULL pointer dereference (NPD) that can be triggered during VM creation error paths. Specifically:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states this leads to "various splats followed by a fatal NPD" (Null Pointer Dereference)
  2. **Vulnerable Code Path**: When `xe_vm_create()` fails after allocation but before `xe_svm_init()` is called, the cleanup path (`xe_vm_close_and_put()`) will call `xe_svm_fini()` on uninitialized SVM state
  3. **Crash Mechanism**: `drm_gpusvm_fini()` will dereference NULL pointers in the uninitialized `vm->svm.gpusvm` structure, particularly `gpusvm->mm` (via `mmdrop(gpusvm->mm)`)
  4. **Exploitability**: While this appears to be triggered by error conditions during VM creation, a malicious user could potentially craft conditions to trigger the error path and cause a kernel crash
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This shares characteristics with other CVE-assigned commits that fix use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference issues in error handling paths
  The fix correctly moves `xe_svm_init()` earlier in the VM creation process and adds proper cleanup handling in the error path to ensure `xe_svm_fini()` is only called on initialized SVM state.
7632fedb266d9 seg6: Fix validation of nexthop addresses
- [sasha] Now I have all the information needed to make a determination.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Memory corruption vulnerability**: The commit fixes a clear memory corruption issue where the kernel reads uninitialized memory when parsing nexthop addresses.
  2. **Security impact**: The vulnerability allows userspace to provide a shorter buffer than expected. When `parse_nla_nh4()` or `parse_nla_nh6()` performs `memcpy()` with `sizeof(struct in_addr)` (4 bytes) or `sizeof(struct in6_addr)` (16 bytes), it reads beyond the user-provided data into uninitialized kernel memory.
  3. **Attack vector**: A local unprivileged user can trigger this by:
     - Sending a netlink message with SEG6_LOCAL_NH4 or SEG6_LOCAL_NH6 attributes
     - Providing attribute data shorter than expected (e.g., 2 bytes instead of 4 for IPv4)
     - The old validation with `.len = sizeof(struct in_addr)` only checks if `attrlen > pt->len`, allowing shorter buffers to pass
  4. **Comparison to similar CVEs**: The vulnerability pattern matches previous CVE-assigned commits that fixed similar validation issues:
     - Like the nvme-tcp commits that fixed header length validation to prevent memory corruption
     - Like the IPv6 commits that fixed uninitialized value access
  5. **Fix mechanism**: The change from `.len = sizeof(...)` to `NLA_POLICY_EXACT_LEN(sizeof(...))` enforces exact length matching, preventing both over-reading and under-reading of the attribute data.
  The vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure (reading uninitialized kernel memory) or memory corruption, making it a legitimate security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
feafc73f3e6ae net: prevent a NULL deref in rtnl_create_link()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Local-only impact**: The NULL dereference occurs in `rtnl_create_link()` during network link creation, which requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges. This is not accessible to unprivileged users.
  2. **Configuration-specific**: The issue only occurs when CONFIG_NET_SHAPER is defined and triggers a NULL pointer dereference in `netdev_need_ops_lock()` when `dev->netdev_ops` is NULL.
  3. **Non-exploitable crash**: This is a simple NULL pointer dereference that would cause a kernel panic/crash but cannot be leveraged for privilege escalation or other security exploits. The crash happens because at the time `rtnl_create_link()` runs, the device hasn't been fully initialized yet (`dev->netdev_ops` is still NULL).
  4. **Administrative operation**: Creating network links via rtnetlink requires administrative privileges, limiting the exposure to trusted users only.
  5. **Simple fix**: The fix simply replaces `dev_set_group()` (which tries to lock operations) with `netif_set_group()` (which doesn't require the lock), avoiding the NULL dereference during device creation.
  While this is a bug that causes a kernel crash, it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE as it requires privileged access and cannot be exploited for security gain beyond a DoS that only privileged users can trigger.
535caaca921c6 net: annotate data-races around cleanup_net_task
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with similar commits:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Harmless race condition**: The commit message explicitly states "even if the race is harmless", similar to commits marked as NO CVE (e.g., "netlink: annotate data-races around sk->sk_err" and "wireguard: send: annotate intentional data race").
  2. **No security impact**: The changes only add READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() annotations to avoid KCSAN warnings. The cleanup_net_task variable is used only for optimization purposes in from_cleanup_net() to decide whether to use expedited RCU synchronization.
  3. **Pattern of NO CVE assignments**: Similar commits that annotate harmless data races were marked as NO CVE:
     - "netlink: annotate data-races around sk->sk_err" - marked NO
     - "wireguard: send: annotate intentional data race" - marked NO
     - "debugobjects: Annotate racy debug variables" - marked NO
  4. **Contrast with YES CVE commits**: The commits marked YES involved:
     - "packet: annotate data-races around ignore_outgoing" - affects packet filtering behavior
     - "net: annotate races around sk->sk_bound_dev_if" - affects socket binding and routing decisions
  5. **Limited scope**: The variable is only used to optimize RCU synchronization timing in cleanup_net() - it doesn't affect security boundaries, access control, or data integrity.
  The race condition here is purely a performance optimization detail with no security implications.
e6854be4d80ea selftests: drv-net: tso: make bkg() wait for socat to quit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Test-only change**: The modification is purely in a selftest file (`tools/testing/selftests/drivers/net/hw/tso.py`), not in kernel code that runs in production systems.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The change simply adds `exit_wait=True` parameter to a `bkg()` function call to avoid a warning message about shell behavior. This is a cosmetic/correctness fix to suppress warning messages.
  3. **No functional impact**: The commit message explicitly states this is to avoid a warning ("Warning: combining shell and terminate is risky!") being printed. The actual test functionality remains unchanged.
  4. **Test infrastructure improvement**: This is a minor improvement to test infrastructure to handle process termination more cleanly across different shells (zsh/ksh).
  The change from:
  ```python
  with bkg(listen_cmd, host=cfg.remote) as nc:
  ```
  to:
  ```python
  with bkg(listen_cmd, host=cfg.remote, exit_wait=True) as nc:
  ```
  Simply tells the test framework to wait for the socat process to exit naturally instead of terminating it forcefully, which avoids potential issues with SIGTERM not reaching child processes in certain shells.
  This is similar to the other "NO CVE" examples provided, which are all selftest improvements or fixes that don't affect production kernel code or introduce any security vulnerabilities.
c68804c934e31 selftests: drv-net: tso: fix the GRE device name
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Test-only change**: The change is entirely within a selftest file (`tools/testing/selftests/drivers/net/hw/tso.py`). It does not modify any kernel production code that could affect system security or stability.
  2. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes a typo in the device type name used in a test - changing from "ipgre" to "gre" for IPv4 GRE tunnels. This is a test configuration issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The incorrect device type would cause the test to fail (likely with an error creating the device), but would not:
     - Create any privilege escalation opportunities
     - Cause memory corruption or leaks
     - Bypass any security controls
     - Affect production systems
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, none of them received CVEs despite fixing actual kernel networking code (not just tests). Those commits fixed:
     - IPv6 link-local address generation issues
     - UDP GRO test failures
     - Missing test configurations
     
     All were marked "CVE Status: NO" because they didn't introduce security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Code impact**: The change at line 219 simply corrects the device type string from "ipgre" to "gre" in test configuration data. This would only affect whether the test runs successfully, not any production functionality.
  The commit is a simple test fix to ensure the TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) selftest works correctly for IPv4 GRE tunnels. It has no security implications whatsoever.
db9ae3b6b43c7 wireguard: device: enable threaded NAPI
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change enables threaded NAPI for WireGuard devices by adding `dev_set_threaded(dev, true);`, which is a performance optimization, not a security fix.
  The issue being addressed is that multiple WireGuard tunnels experience performance degradation (from ~48 Gbps potential to ~13 Gbps actual) due to NAPI polling converging onto a single CPU core. This is a scalability/performance issue, not a security vulnerability. There is no:
  - Kernel crash or panic
  - Memory corruption
  - Information disclosure
  - Privilege escalation  
  - Denial of service (the system continues to function, just with reduced throughput)
  The fix simply moves NAPI polling from softirq context to dedicated kernel threads, allowing better CPU utilization across cores. This aligns with similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" that addressed performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
8af7a919c52f0 netlink: specs: rt-link: decode ip6gre
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a documentation/specification change to a YAML file (`Documentation/netlink/specs/rt-link.yaml`) that describes the netlink protocol structure. It does not modify any actual kernel code that runs in production.
  2. **Purpose**: The change adds decoding support for ip6gre tunnels in the YNL (YAML Netlink) tooling, which is used for testing and development purposes. As the commit message states, this is needed because "Driver tests now require GRE tunnels" and YNL complains when it sees unrecognized link types.
  3. **Type correction**: While the commit does correct the type of `encap-limit` from u32 to u8, this is a specification correction for documentation/tooling purposes, not a fix to actual kernel behavior. The commit message notes this attribute is "only used in ip6gre, so the mistake didn't matter until now."
  4. **No security impact**: There is no security vulnerability being fixed here. The change only affects:
     - How YNL tools decode/interpret netlink messages for ip6gre tunnels
     - Test infrastructure (fixing test failures)
     - Documentation accuracy
  5. **Similar commits**: The reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" show similar patterns - they are all netlink specification updates for documentation/tooling purposes without security implications.
  This is a functional fix for tooling/testing infrastructure, not a security vulnerability fix.
de92258e3b22b netlink: specs: rt-link: add missing byte-order properties
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Documentation/specification change only**: The commit only modifies YAML specification files in `Documentation/netlink/specs/rt-link.yaml`. These are documentation files that describe the netlink API specification - they don't change any actual kernel code or behavior.
  2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: The kernel code already correctly handles these fields in big-endian format (as evidenced by the use of `nla_put_be16()`, `nla_put_be32()`, `nla_get_be16()`, and `nla_get_be32()` functions). The specification was simply missing the proper `byte-order: big-endian` annotations.
  3. **No impact on kernel security**: This is purely a documentation fix to ensure that userspace tools parsing the YAML specification understand that these fields should be interpreted as big-endian. The kernel's actual handling of these values was already correct.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the reference commits shown (fixing YAML specs for mptcp, rtnetlink attributes, etc.) which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they only fix documentation/specification issues without addressing actual security vulnerabilities.
  The commit message confirms this is just fixing missing byte-order properties in the specification, not fixing any actual endianness handling bugs in the kernel code itself.
501fe52aa908c net: wwan: mhi_wwan_mbim: use correct mux_id for multiplexing
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a functional bug fix for incorrect mux_id mapping in multiplexed data calls for Qualcomm SDX72/75 chipsets. The issue was that sessionId = 1 was incorrectly mapped to muxId = 1 instead of muxId = 113 (112 + 1).
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The bug causes multiplexed data calls to fail with "bad packet session" errors
     - It's a connectivity/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data leakage occurs
  3. **Code changes examination**:
     - The fix moves the session_id assignment from `link->session = if_id` to `link->session = mhi_mbim_get_link_mux_id(link->mbim->mdev->mhi_cntrl) + if_id`
     - This ensures proper offset calculation for the mux_id
     - The change is purely arithmetic - adding an offset to properly map session IDs
  4. **Security implications**: 
     - No security boundaries are crossed
     - No unauthorized access is gained
     - No sensitive data is exposed
     - The error handling (line 299 in mhi_mbim_rx) properly rejects invalid sessions
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar to commit 2 (mt76 WCID phy_idx assignment) which was marked NO CVE - both are simple index/ID mapping fixes
     - Unlike commit 4 (qcom-spmi-pmic) which had CVE status YES due to NULL pointer dereference and race conditions
  This is a standard bug fix for device compatibility/functionality with no security impact.
1e1f706fc2ce9 wifi: cfg80211/mac80211: correctly parse S1G beacon optional elements
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the information I have:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability Fix**: This commit fixes incorrect parsing of S1G beacon frames, but the issue does not introduce a security vulnerability. The problem was that the code made incorrect assumptions about frame layout without checking frame control bits, leading to incorrect offset calculations.
  2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: While the commit mentions "incorrect offsets to the 'variable' portion of the frame," the existing code already had length validation (`WARN_ON(len < min_hdr_len)`) that would prevent out-of-bounds access. The issue was calculating the wrong offset within valid bounds, not accessing memory beyond bounds.
  3. **Functional Bug, Not Security Bug**: The old code assumed fixed layouts for S1G beacons:
     - Regular S1G beacon: fixed offset to `u.s1g_beacon.variable`
     - Short S1G beacon: fixed offset to `u.s1g_short_beacon.variable`
     
     The new code properly calculates offsets based on optional fields (Next TBTT, CSSID, ANO) indicated by frame control bits. This fixes functional parsing but doesn't address a security vulnerability.
  4. **Different from CVE-Assigned Commits**: Compare to similar commit 4 (CVE assigned) which validates HE operation element length to prevent buffer overruns. That commit added missing bounds checking. This commit just corrects offset calculations within already-validated bounds.
  5. **No Exploitable Condition**: The incorrect parsing would cause S1G beacons to be processed with wrong element offsets, potentially leading to failed connections or incorrect behavior, but not to memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.
  The commit is a correctness fix for IEEE 802.11ah (S1G) beacon parsing, ensuring proper handling of optional fields, but does not address any security vulnerability.
bc1a65eb81a21 net: dsa: b53: do not touch DLL_IQQD on bcm53115
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on what we have:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a hardware-specific configuration adjustment for the BCM53115 chip's RGMII register. The change prevents setting the RGMII_CTRL_TIMING_SEL bit (which controls DLL_IQQD) specifically for BCM53115.
  2. **No security impact**: The commit message indicates this bit has a different meaning on BCM53115 related to power management ("In the IDDQ mode, power is down"). The change ensures proper hardware operation by not setting a bit that has different semantics on this specific chip.
  3. **Functional fix**: The code change shows this is purely a functional correction - the RGMII delay configuration already works without setting this bit, so the change just avoids potentially incorrect hardware configuration.
  4. **Limited scope**: The change only affects BCM53115 chips specifically (`if (dev->chip_id != BCM53115_DEVICE_ID)`) and doesn't introduce any vulnerability or fix a security issue.
  5. **No exploitation potential**: There's no indication that the previous behavior could be exploited for any malicious purpose. It's simply ensuring correct hardware register configuration for a specific chip variant.
  The similar commits provided also show this pattern - they are functional fixes for the b53 driver (synchronization, link state management, loopback configuration) without security implications.
5ea0d42c1980e net: dsa: b53: allow RGMII for bcm63xx RGMII ports
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security issue. The commit fixes missing RGMII interface support for BCM63xx RGMII ports (ports 4-7), which prevented these ports from being configured properly.
  2. **Functionality issue only**: The error message in the commit shows this was causing validation failures during PHY setup:
     ```
     validation of rgmii with support 0000000,00000000,00000000,000062ff and advertisement 0000000,00000000,00000000,000062ff failed: -EINVAL
     ```
     This prevented the ports from working in RGMII mode, but didn't create any security vulnerability.
  3. **Simple omission fix**: The code change simply adds RGMII interface support for BCM63xx devices on ports 4-7 by calling `phy_interface_set_rgmii()`. The original commit (ce3bf94871f7) added RGMII configuration support but forgot to declare that these ports support RGMII interfaces.
  4. **No security impact**: There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service (beyond the port not working)
     - Input validation bypass
     - Access control issues
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the pattern of the "CVE Status: NO" reference commits which also fixed interface/capability declarations (like mv88e6320_phylink_get_caps and mv88e6250_phylink_get_caps).
  The commit is a straightforward bug fix that enables functionality that was supposed to work but was missing due to an incomplete implementation.
75f4f7b2b1300 net: dsa: b53: do not configure bcm63xx's IMP port interface
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit prevents writing to an undefined register (`B53_RGMII_CTRL_IMP`) for the IMP (Internal Management Port) on bcm63xx devices. The commit message states this "does not seem to have any side effects" - indicating no security impact was observed.
  2. **Code changes analysis**:
     - The main change is replacing the condition `port >= B53_63XX_RGMII0` with `in_range(port, B53_63XX_RGMII0, 4)`
     - This limits RGMII configuration to only the 4 actual RGMII ports (ports 4-7) and excludes the IMP port
     - The IMP port handling code that wrote to `B53_RGMII_CTRL_IMP` is removed
  3. **No security vulnerability characteristics**:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - No privilege escalation
     - No authentication bypass
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service impact mentioned
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: The reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show similar patterns - they fix configuration issues, MTU handling, and hardware errata workarounds without security implications.
  5. **Impact assessment**: This is a correctness fix that prevents touching an undefined register. The commit explicitly states it has no observed side effects, suggesting it's a preventive cleanup rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
  The change improves code correctness by ensuring only valid RGMII ports are configured, but does not address any security vulnerability.
e39d14a760c03 net: dsa: b53: implement setting ageing time
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **It's a feature addition, not a security fix**: The commit implements a new feature (setting ageing time) for the b53 DSA switch driver. It's not fixing any security vulnerability or addressing any existing security issue.
  2. **The code changes are benign**:
     - Adds `b53_set_ageing_time()` function that writes to hardware registers (`B53_AGING_TIME_CONTROL`)
     - Sets proper min/max ageing time bounds (1-1048575 seconds)
     - Adds the function to the switch operations structure
     - Uses proper bounds checking with `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()`
  3. **No security implications**: 
     - The ageing time controls how long the switch keeps MAC address entries in its forwarding database
     - This is a standard switch feature for managing FDB (Forwarding Database) entries
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant patterns
  4. **Similar to other DSA drivers**: The implementation follows the same pattern as other DSA drivers (mt7530, mv88e6xxx, etc.) that already have this functionality.
  The commit simply adds missing functionality to make the b53 driver comply with DSA framework expectations for bridge ageing time configuration, allowing it to pass FDB learning tests.
4af523551d876 net: dsa: b53: do not enable RGMII delay on bcm63xx
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the kernel code:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a functional issue with RGMII delay configuration on BCM63xx chips. The change removes code that was incorrectly enabling MAC-side delays when the hardware design requires the PHY to handle these delays. This is a timing/compatibility issue at the physical layer that affects link stability and functionality, not security.
  Key reasons:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: RGMII delays control electrical signal timing between MAC and PHY - misconfiguration causes link failures or packet corruption, not exploitable conditions
  2. **Physical layer issue**: Operating below any protocol layer where security vulnerabilities could exist
  3. **Functional fix**: Addresses hardware compatibility to ensure proper Ethernet operation with PHYs like BCM54612E
  4. **Similar commits**: All the referenced similar commits (mv88e6xxx timing erratum, b53 jumbo frames, GMAC phy-mode fixes) were marked "CVE Status: NO" as they're hardware configuration/compatibility fixes
  The RGMII_CTRL_DLL_RXC and RGMII_CTRL_DLL_TXC bits simply control 2ns delays on clock signals - their misconfiguration cannot be exploited for any security purpose.
1237c2d4a8db7 net: dsa: b53: do not enable EEE on bcm63xx
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The issue requires local access with administrative privileges to trigger. The system hang occurs when EEE is configured on BCM63xx hardware that doesn't support it, which requires root-level network configuration changes.
  2. **Hardware-Specific Functional Bug**: This is a hardware compatibility issue where BCM63xx internal switches don't support EEE registers, causing the system to hang when accessing non-existent registers. It's not a security vulnerability that can be exploited for unauthorized access, data theft, or privilege escalation.
  3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The bug doesn't cross any security boundaries - it's a kernel driver incorrectly assuming hardware capabilities, leading to a system hang. There's no path for:
     - Remote exploitation
     - Privilege escalation
     - Memory corruption
     - Information disclosure
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they deal with:
     - EEE configuration fixes (commit 1)
     - MTU handling (commits 2 & 3)
     - Initial EEE policy configuration (commit 4)
     - Disabling broken EEE support (commit 5)
     
     None of these functional fixes received CVEs despite fixing various network functionality issues.
  5. **Impact Classification**: While the system hang is disruptive, it's a local denial of service that requires privileged access to trigger. The fix prevents writes to non-existent registers by properly identifying hardware that doesn't support EEE.
  The commit is a proper bug fix that prevents system instability on specific hardware, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
919d763d60942 net: ti: icssg-prueth: Fix swapped TX stats for MII interfaces.
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No Security Impact**: This fix addresses incorrect TX statistics reporting in MII mode, which is purely an informational/monitoring issue. The actual data transmission functionality is not affected - only the statistics counters are being read from the wrong hardware slice.
  2. **No Exploitable Vulnerability**: The bug cannot be exploited to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Cause denial of service
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Escalate privileges
     - Affect system integrity
  3. **Limited to Statistics Reporting**: The code change only affects how TX packet/byte counters are read and reported to userspace. It doesn't impact:
     - Data flow or packet transmission
     - Memory safety
     - Access controls
     - Network security
  4. **Expected Hardware Behavior**: The commit message explicitly states this TX line swapping is "expected hardware behavior" in MII mode. The driver simply wasn't accounting for it when reading statistics.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This fix is similar in nature to the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO", which also dealt with driver improvements and bug fixes that don't introduce security vulnerabilities (stats locking, signedness fixes, filter counters).
  The commit is a functional bug fix for incorrect monitoring/statistics data, not a security vulnerability fix.
50d9ce9679dd5 netfilter: nf_nat: also check reverse tuple to obtain clashing entry
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: The bug causes incorrect NAT port allocation behavior that results in packet drops at `nf_conntrack_confirm()` time. The commit message explicitly states that "Such conntrack will then be discarded at nf_confirm time" - meaning packets are dropped rather than being misrouted or causing unauthorized access.
  2. **No Privilege Escalation or Security Bypass**: The code changes show this is a logic error in collision detection for NAT entries. When the bug occurs, it leads to connection failures/drops rather than security violations. There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
  3. **Functional Bug Rather Than Security Vulnerability**: The issue is that the NAT engine fails to detect certain collision cases when checking reverse tuples, leading to incorrect port allocation decisions. This causes legitimate connections to fail, which is a denial of service in the sense of "service not working correctly" but not a security vulnerability.
  4. **The IPS_SEQ_ADJUST Fix**: The change from `IPS_SEQ_ADJUST_BIT` to `IPS_SEQ_ADJUST` is fixing an incorrect bit test (using the bit position instead of the actual bitmask), but this only affects TCP sequence number adjustment detection, which the commit notes has "little consequence in practice."
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commit**: This commit is very similar to the first similar commit (d8f84a9bc7c4) which was marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both deal with NAT collision detection improvements without introducing security vulnerabilities.
  The commit fixes a functional bug that causes connection failures in specific NAT scenarios but does not introduce or fix a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
ea77c397bff8b netfilter: nf_set_pipapo_avx2: fix initial map fill
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination on whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security-Relevant Memory Corruption**: The bug causes incorrect initialization of bitmap memory, leading to "leaked" one-bits that corrupt the matching algorithm. The code shows that when `f->bsize < m->bsize_max`, the excess bits are not zeroed out, causing them to leak into subsequent matching rounds.
  2. **Firewall Bypass Potential**: The commit message explicitly states "This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where first field size is not the largest." This means firewall rules using pipapo sets could incorrectly match packets, potentially allowing unauthorized traffic through or blocking legitimate traffic.
  3. **Similar to Previous CVE**: The commit references "Fixes: 791a615b7ad2" which itself was assigned a CVE (as shown in the similar commits with CVE Status: YES). This is essentially fixing an incomplete fix of a security vulnerability - the original fix only addressed the generic C implementation but missed the AVX2 vectorized implementation.
  4. **Exploitable Condition**: The vulnerability affects production systems using nftables with pipapo sets where fields are concatenated and the first field has a smaller bitmap size than subsequent fields - a realistic configuration scenario.
  5. **Code Analysis**: The new `pipapo_resmap_init_avx2()` function shows the security-critical nature:
  ```c
  for (i = f->bsize; i < m->bsize_max; i++)
      res_map[i] = 0ul;
  ```
  Without this zeroing, arbitrary memory content (potentially all-ones from previous operations) would affect packet matching decisions.
  The security impact is clear: incorrect packet classification in a firewall component can lead to access control bypass, making this a legitimate security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
5dc1ea903588a drm/panel-simple: fix the warnings for the Evervision VGG644804
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. The code shows that:
  1. Missing connector_type causes a warning
  2. For LVDS panels with RGB666_1X7X3_SPWG format, bpc must be 6 (not 8)
  3. bus_flags for LVDS panels should only have specific flags (DE_LOW/HIGH, DATA_MSB_TO_LSB/LSB_TO_MSB)
  The commit fixes:
  - Missing connector_type (adds DRM_MODE_CONNECTOR_LVDS)
  - Wrong bpc (changes from 8 to 6 for RGB666 format)
  - Wrong bus_flags (removes DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_SAMPLE_NEGEDGE which is not allowed for LVDS)
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes fix configuration warnings and incorrect panel parameters:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: The issues are purely configuration/parameter problems that cause warnings, not security vulnerabilities
  2. **No memory corruption or exploitable conditions**: Wrong bpc (8 vs 6) and missing connector_type don't create exploitable conditions
  3. **Functional fixes only**: The changes ensure the panel operates with correct parameters and eliminates driver warnings
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Like the similar commits shown (adding missing bus_format, connector_type, etc.), these are display configuration corrections, not security fixes
  The commit is a simple bug fix that corrects panel configuration parameters to match hardware specifications and eliminate warnings during driver initialization.
960c7e6d38803 wifi: iwlwifi: mld: avoid panic on init failure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this commit should be assigned a CVE. Let me analyze the issue:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can cause a kernel panic. The issue occurs when:
  1. **Initialization fails** during device startup
  2. The `in_hw_restart` flag is incorrectly set to true even though the firmware never successfully started
  3. When attempting a retry, the code assumes it's in a restart scenario (where structures would already be initialized) rather than a fresh init
  4. This leads to attempting to cancel `rx_omi::finished_work` which was never initialized, causing a NULL pointer dereference
  The commit message explicitly states this causes a "panic on init failure" through a NULL pointer dereference. The fix adds a check to only set `in_hw_restart = true` when `mld->fw_status.running` is also true, ensuring the firmware was actually running before marking it as a restart scenario.
  This is a security vulnerability because:
  - It causes a kernel panic (system crash/DoS)
  - Can be triggered by hardware initialization failures
  - The NULL pointer dereference occurs in kernel space
  - It affects system availability
  The vulnerability pattern is similar to the CVE-assigned commit #5 which also involved improper state management leading to potential crashes.
791d76005de0a drm/i915/display: Fix u32 overflow in SNPS PHY HDMI PLL setup
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Mathematical Overflow, Not Memory Overflow**: The bug is a pure arithmetic overflow in PLL frequency calculations. The `do_div()` macro expects a 32-bit divisor but was being passed values that could exceed 32 bits at high HDMI data rates. This causes incorrect division results, not memory corruption.
  2. **Display Functionality Only**: The impact is limited to incorrect HDMI PLL configuration, which results in wrong display frequencies. This manifests as display malfunction (no signal, wrong resolution, garbled output) but poses no security risk.
  3. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The bug:
     - Does not allow privilege escalation
     - Does not expose sensitive information
     - Does not allow code execution
     - Does not corrupt memory
     - Cannot be exploited remotely
  4. **Limited Attack Surface**: To trigger this bug, one would need:
     - Very high HDMI data rates (approaching 16GHz)
     - Control over display mode settings
     - This typically requires physical access or already elevated privileges
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the "Similar Commit 1" and "Similar Commit 3" which were also display driver calculation fixes that were not assigned CVEs. In contrast, "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" that received CVEs involved actual integer overflows that could lead to memory corruption or other security-relevant impacts.
  The fix simply ensures correct arithmetic by using proper 64-bit division functions (`div64_u64` and `DIV64_U64_ROUND_UP`) instead of macros that internally truncate to 32 bits. This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
12c331b29c739 gve: add missing NULL check for gve_alloc_pending_packet() in TX DQO
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and commit, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Clear NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The code at line 766 in the original version directly dereferences `pkt` with `pkt->skb = skb;` without checking if `gve_alloc_pending_packet()` returned NULL.
  2. **Function can return NULL**: The `gve_alloc_pending_packet()` function explicitly returns NULL when it cannot allocate a pending packet (line 130 in the function shows `return NULL;`).
  3. **Remote triggerable in low-memory conditions**: This vulnerability can be triggered when the system is under memory pressure or when pending packets are exhausted, which could potentially be induced by remote network traffic.
  4. **Crash/DoS potential**: A NULL pointer dereference in the kernel network transmit path will cause a kernel panic, resulting in a system crash and denial of service.
  5. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: This matches the pattern of the similar commits shown that were assigned CVEs - they all involve missing NULL checks after memory allocation functions that can fail, particularly in network drivers where the failure can be triggered by external network conditions.
  6. **Production impact**: The Google Virtual Ethernet (gve) driver is used in production Google Cloud environments, so this vulnerability could affect cloud infrastructure.
  The fix correctly adds the NULL check and returns -ENOMEM, preventing the NULL pointer dereference and allowing the driver to handle the allocation failure gracefully.
c4b680ac28638 nvme: fix implicit bool to flags conversion
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a type conversion fix that changes from passing a bool value (`vec`) to explicitly passing the correct flag (`vec ? NVME_IOCTL_VEC : 0`). The code was already working correctly due to implicit conversion.
  2. **No security impact**: The change doesn't fix any security vulnerability. The previous code worked correctly because:
     - `vec` is a bool that converts to 0 or 1
     - `NVME_IOCTL_VEC` is defined as `(1 << 0)` which equals 1
     - When `vec` is true, it converts to 1, which matches `NVME_IOCTL_VEC`
     - When `vec` is false, it converts to 0, which correctly indicates no flags
  3. **Code quality improvement**: This is purely a code quality improvement to make the intent explicit and avoid relying on implicit bool-to-int conversion that happens to match the flag value.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information leak, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed here.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as references (like "nvme-ioctl: fix leaked requests on mapping error"), even commits that fix actual bugs like resource leaks are marked as "CVE Status: NO" when they don't have direct security implications.
  The commit improves code clarity and removes implicit behavior, but doesn't address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
10f4a7cd724e3 nvme: fix command limits status code
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a code cleanup/correctness fix that addresses a naming inconsistency and removes incorrect special handling, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit renames `NVME_SC_ONCS_NOT_SUPPORTED` to `NVME_SC_CMD_SIZE_LIM_EXCEEDED` to match the NVMe 2.0 specification, where this status code (0x183) is specifically defined for "Command Size Limits Exceeded" and only applies to DSM and Copy commands.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes are:
     - Renaming a constant to match the specification
     - Removing special case handling in `nvme_status_to_pr_err()` where it returned `-EOPNOTSUPP`
     - Removing special case handling in target code that was incorrectly returning this status for DSM and write_zeroes commands
     - All paths still return appropriate error codes (either `NVME_SC_INVALID_OPCODE` or other suitable errors)
  3. **No exploitable condition**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant bug being fixed. The code before and after the fix both handle errors appropriately - just with different (more correct) status codes.
  4. **Functional correctness only**: This is purely a spec compliance issue where the wrong status code was being used for certain conditions. The fix ensures that status codes match what the NVMe specification defines, improving interoperability and correctness but not security.
  The commit is similar to the other "NO CVE" examples shown, which also dealt with status code handling, naming corrections, and spec compliance without any security implications.
43a67dd812c5d block: flip iter directions in blk_rq_integrity_map_user()
- [sasha] Now I understand the flow better. The bug causes:
  1. For WRITE operations (data going TO the device):
     - Bug uses ITER_DEST (wrong - meant for destinations)
     - Should use ITER_SOURCE (correct - user buffer is the source)
     - This could cause the kernel to try to copy TO the user buffer instead of FROM it
  2. For READ operations (data coming FROM the device):
     - Bug uses ITER_SOURCE (wrong - meant for sources)
     - Should use ITER_DEST (correct - user buffer is the destination)
     - This could cause the kernel to try to copy FROM the user buffer instead of TO it
  This is a serious bug that could lead to:
  - Information disclosure (kernel memory being exposed to userspace)
  - Memory corruption (writing to wrong memory locations)
  - Potential privilege escalation if sensitive kernel data is exposed
  Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with similar commits marked as CVE:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug inverts the data flow direction for integrity metadata operations, which can lead to unauthorized memory access in both directions - reading kernel memory that shouldn't be accessible (information disclosure) and writing to unintended memory locations (memory corruption).
  2. **Wrong Direction Data Flow**: For write operations, the kernel would attempt to copy FROM the destination instead of TO it, and for read operations, it would copy TO the source instead of FROM it. This fundamental misdirection of data flow is a security vulnerability.
  3. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This bug pattern is similar to commit "block: Fix WARNING in _copy_from_iter" which was assigned a CVE - both involve incorrect iterator direction handling that can lead to memory safety issues.
  4. **Exploitable**: The bug affects the bio integrity mapping path used by storage drivers like NVMe, making it potentially exploitable through normal device I/O operations with integrity metadata.
  5. **Memory Safety Violation**: The incorrect iterator direction can cause the kernel to access memory in ways that violate expected security boundaries, potentially exposing sensitive kernel data or corrupting memory.
d46c4c839c20a PM: sleep: Fix power.is_suspended cleanup for direct-complete devices
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes more carefully. The commit moves the clearing of `dev->power.is_suspended` from after the resume callbacks to immediately after the check for `is_suspended`:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a logic bug in the PM (Power Management) subsystem that causes incorrect state tracking. The `power.is_suspended` flag remains set for direct-complete devices across suspend-resume cycles when it should have been cleared.
  2. **Impact**: The primary impact is that "scary error messages" are logged when they shouldn't be. The commit message explicitly states this causes error messages to be logged inappropriately, but doesn't indicate any security impact, data corruption, or system instability.
  3. **Not a security vulnerability**: The bug doesn't enable any of the following security-relevant issues:
     - No privilege escalation
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond cosmetic log messages
     - No bypass of security boundaries
  4. **Code change analysis**: The fix simply moves the line `dev->power.is_suspended = false;` from line 1006 (after resume callbacks) to line 943 (immediately after the is_suspended check). This ensures the flag is cleared for ALL devices that enter device_resume(), including direct-complete devices that skip the main resume path.
  5. **Similar commits pattern**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" deal with PM subsystem correctness issues, state management bugs, and proper handling of edge cases - none involve security vulnerabilities.
  This is a functional correctness bug in device power state tracking that results in incorrect but harmless error logging. It does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment.
d26625d034fb8 drm/amdgpu/gfx10: Refine Cleaner Shader for GFX10.1.10
- [sasha] Based on the analysis of the code changes and understanding of the security context:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of Changes**: The commit is fixing implementation bugs in the cleaner shader code that was recently added. The changes are:
     - Correcting hex values from `0xbe803080` to `0xbe803000`
     - Fixing the SGPR clearing logic to properly clear registers (changing from clearing to 0 to properly using s0 as source)
     - Fixing a typo in the assembly comments
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Introduction**: This commit is actually IMPROVING security by fixing bugs in the cleaner shader implementation. The original cleaner shader (commit 25961bad9212) was designed to prevent data leaks between GPU workloads by clearing registers. This commit makes that implementation work correctly.
  3. **Bug Fix vs Vulnerability Fix**: While this fixes bugs in security-related code, it's not fixing a security vulnerability per se. The cleaner shader feature itself addresses the security concern of data leakage between workloads. This commit just ensures the cleaner shader works as intended.
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: 
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Added the initial cleaner shader implementation
     - Similar Commit 2 & 3 (YES CVE): Fixed a memory leak by adding missing deinitialization
     - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Fixed when the cleaner shader is emitted
     - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Fixed a functional issue with cleaner shader execution
  5. **The Key Difference**: Commits that received CVEs (2 & 3) fixed actual memory leaks that could lead to denial of service or information disclosure. This commit is fixing implementation correctness in newly added code that hasn't yet reached end users in a way that would create an exploitable vulnerability.
  The cleaner shader code itself is a security feature, and this commit ensures it works correctly. It's a bug fix in new code rather than a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability.
120f28a6f314f iavf: get rid of the crit lock
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Fixes Critical Deadlock Vulnerabilities**: The commit explicitly fixes two deadlock scenarios ([splat1] and [splat2]) that are proven by lockdep traces. These deadlocks can hang kernel threads and make the network interface unresponsive, constituting a Denial of Service vulnerability.
  2. **Exploitable Attack Vector**: The commit message references that these deadlocks were introduced by a previous fix (d1639a17319b) which itself was fixing deadlocks. The analysis shows these can be triggered through normal network operations like VF configuration changes, making them exploitable with relatively low privileges.
  3. **Security Impact in Virtualized Environments**: In virtualized environments, a malicious VM guest controlling a VF could trigger these deadlocks and impact the host system, affecting other VMs and the overall system stability.
  4. **Precedent from Similar Commits**: All five similar commits provided that fix deadlock issues in network drivers were assigned CVEs:
     - netfilter IDLETIMER deadlock fixes
     - ice driver LAG and VF lock dependency fix  
     - IB/ipoib mcast list locking fix
     - igb driver rtnl_lock deadlock fix
  5. **Code Changes Show Security Fix**: The commit completely removes the problematic crit_lock and replaces it with proper netdev_lock usage, indicating this is not just a minor adjustment but a significant fix to prevent system hangs.
  The deadlocks enable local Denial of Service attacks that can require a system reboot to recover, making this a clear security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
05702b5c949bd iavf: sprinkle netdev_assert_locked() annotations
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit adds `netdev_assert_locked()` annotations, which are debug-only lockdep assertions used to verify proper locking discipline. These annotations:
  1. **Are not fixing a security vulnerability** - They're adding debugging checks via `lockdep_assert_held()` that only run when CONFIG_LOCKDEP is enabled
  2. **Do not change runtime behavior** - The `netdev_assert_locked()` macro expands to `lockdep_assert_held(&dev->lock)` which is a no-op in production kernels
  3. **Are preparation for future changes** - The commit message explicitly states these annotations are added because "next commit will remove crit lock"
  4. **Similar to commits marked NO** - This is analogous to the "net: ti: icssg-prueth: Add lock to stats" commit which added locking annotations for statistics and was marked NO
  The annotations help developers catch locking violations during development but don't fix any actual race conditions or security issues in the current code.
257a8241ad7f4 iavf: extract iavf_watchdog_step() out of iavf_watchdog_task()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit is a pure refactoring change that extracts the core logic of `iavf_watchdog_task()` into a separate function `iavf_watchdog_step()`. The security-relevant observations are:
  1. **No functional changes**: The commit merely moves code from one function to another without changing the logic or behavior. All the state transitions, error handling, and timing delays remain identical.
  2. **Locking remains consistent**: The new `iavf_watchdog_step()` function maintains the same locking requirements:
     - It requires `netdev_lock` to be held (enforced via `netdev_assert_locked()`)
     - It requires `adapter->crit_lock` to be held (enforced via `lockdep_assert_held()`)
     - The calling function `iavf_watchdog_task()` continues to acquire these locks in the same order
  3. **No new attack surface**: The refactoring doesn't introduce any new code paths, state transitions, or external interfaces that could be exploited.
  4. **Pure code organization**: This is a maintenance change to improve code readability and reduce function complexity (as noted in the commit message: "47 insertions(+), 82 deletions(-)").
  Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual bugs (deadlocks, memory corruption, race conditions), this commit is purely cosmetic and doesn't address any security vulnerability.
ecb4cd0461acc iavf: simplify watchdog_task in terms of adminq task scheduling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to provide a clear answer:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure code refactoring**: The commit message explicitly states this is a "simplification" of the watchdog_task scheduling logic. The condition for scheduling remains the same but executes in more scenarios.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The changes involve:
     - Moving the `watchdog_done` label location
     - Simplifying when `msec_delay` is set
     - Removing redundant code paths (the `skip_unlock` label is removed)
     - Consolidating the adminq task scheduling logic
  3. **Code flow improvements only**: The key changes show:
     - Setting `msec_delay = 20` at the beginning when mutex_trylock fails
     - Moving the adminq scheduling check after mutex_unlock
     - Removing duplicate delay setting logic
  4. **No security-relevant patterns**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commit (Similar Commit 2) which fixed a hang/DoS condition in io_uring, this commit shows no evidence of:
     - Race condition fixes
     - Memory corruption fixes
     - DoS vulnerability patches
     - Input validation improvements
     - Access control changes
  The commit is purely an internal driver code cleanup that makes the watchdog task logic clearer and more maintainable without addressing any security issues.
099418da91b7d iavf: centralize watchdog requeueing itself
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Pure refactoring with no functional changes**: The commit is a code cleanup that centralizes the watchdog task rescheduling logic. It replaces repetitive code patterns of `mutex_unlock(); netdev_unlock(); queue_delayed_work()` with a centralized goto-based approach using `msec_delay` variable and `watchdog_done`/`skip_unlock` labels.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit does not fix any security issues such as:
     - No buffer overflows or memory corruption fixes
     - No race conditions or deadlocks fixed
     - No privilege escalation or access control changes
     - No input validation improvements
     - No fixes to prevent DoS attacks
  3. **Locking order preserved**: The critical locking order is maintained - the code still unlocks `crit_lock` before `netdev` lock in the same order as before, just through a different control flow path.
  4. **No behavioral changes**: The watchdog task continues to be rescheduled with the same delays (30ms, 1ms, 1000ms, 2000ms, 5000ms, etc.) as before. The special case handling for `__IAVF_IN_REMOVE_TASK` that prevents rescheduling is preserved using the `IAVF_NO_RESCHED` constant.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to "Similar Commit 1" which was also a refactoring/fix for TC configuration comparison logic and was marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The commit is purely a code maintainability improvement that reduces code duplication without fixing any security vulnerabilities or changing the driver's behavior in ways that could have security implications.
dba35a4bb4a3d iavf: iavf_suspend(): take RTNL before netdev_lock()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Lock ordering issue, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a lock ordering violation between RTNL and netdev_lock(). The proper order is RTNL must be taken before netdev_lock() to avoid potential deadlocks. This is a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Preventative fix**: The commit message indicates this is fixing "an obvious violation of lock ordering" caught by lockdep standards, which means it's fixing a potential deadlock scenario detected by kernel debugging tools, not an actual exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - Moving `rtnl_lock()` before `netdev_lock()` in `iavf_suspend()`
     - Adjusting the unlock order appropriately
     - Using a `running` variable to avoid checking `netif_running()` multiple times
     
     These changes fix the lock ordering but don't address any security-sensitive operations like memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (IB/hfi1 deadlock fix) - marked NO CVE
     - Commits 2-5 (various lock ordering fixes) - marked YES CVE
     
     However, commits 2-5 that received CVEs involved actual system hangs during critical operations (reboot/shutdown) or incorrect lock usage that could cause real deadlocks in production. This commit is fixing a theoretical issue caught by lockdep before it could cause problems.
  5. **Development/debugging nature**: The issue was identified through lockdep (kernel lock debugging infrastructure) rather than actual deadlock occurrences in production, suggesting this is more of a code quality improvement than a security fix.
  The commit improves code correctness by following proper lock ordering conventions but does not fix an exploitable security vulnerability.
a869d3a5eb011 net: airoha: Initialize PPE UPDMEM source-mac table
- [sasha] NO
  This commit fixes a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. The issue was that IPv6 hardware-accelerated traffic was using an uninitialized source MAC ID (hardcoded to 0xf) without properly initializing the corresponding UPDMEM table entry. This would cause IPv6 packets to be sent with incorrect/garbage source MAC addresses, leading to network connectivity issues.
  Looking at the specific code changes:
  - The original code used `FIELD_PREP(AIROHA_FOE_MAC_SMAC_ID, 0xf)` for all IPv6 entries
  - The UPDMEM table at index 0xf was never initialized with an actual MAC address
  - The fix properly initializes the UPDMEM table with device MAC addresses and uses the correct port ID
  While this could cause network disruption, it doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability:
  1. It doesn't allow privilege escalation
  2. It doesn't expose sensitive information
  3. It doesn't enable remote code execution
  4. It's not exploitable by attackers - it's simply broken functionality that prevents proper IPv6 hardware acceleration
  This is consistent with the similar commits shown (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), which fix register definitions, error paths, and other functional issues in the airoha driver without security implications.
c683e378c0907 net: airoha: Add the capability to allocate hfwd descriptors in SRAM
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a performance enhancement feature, not a security vulnerability fix. The changes add the capability to allocate hardware forwarding descriptors in SRAM instead of DRAM on the EN7581 SoC to improve packet processing performance. The key changes are:
  1. Setting `LMGR_SRAM_MODE_MASK` flag in `airoha_qdma_init_hfwd_queues()` to enable SRAM mode
  2. Adding `AIROHA_FOE_IB2_FAST_PATH` flag for LAN GDM ports in the PPE (Packet Processing Engine) to enable SRAM usage for downlink traffic
  3. Moving `airhoa_is_lan_gdm_port()` function to header file (code refactoring)
  The commit message explicitly states this is for "improving packet processing and packet forwarding performances" - it's a feature addition to take advantage of the hardware's SRAM capabilities, not a fix for any security issue, memory corruption, access control problem, or other vulnerability.
d3f2a9587ebe6 selftests: net: build net/lib dependency in all target
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is a build system fix for kernel selftests that addresses a missing dependency in the Makefile. Specifically:
  1. **Build/Test Infrastructure Issue**: The commit fixes a build issue where `net/lib` dependency was only being built during `make install` but not during `make all` or `make run_tests`. This is purely a development/testing infrastructure problem.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The change only affects how kernel selftests are built - it doesn't modify any kernel code that runs in production systems. The modified line simply adds `$(INSTALL_DEP_TARGETS)` to the build loop to ensure dependencies are built correctly.
  3. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This change is similar to the referenced commits in the analysis which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO". Those commits dealt with:
     - Adding helper scripts to install targets (Commit 1)
     - Adding lib.sh file (Commit 2)
     - Makefile variable changes for test includes (Commit 3)
     - Fixing source paths for lib.sh (Commit 4)
     - Adding netlink helper library for tests (Commit 5)
  All of these were test infrastructure changes without security implications, just like this commit.
  The commit is fixing a developer convenience issue where certain build targets would fail unless using the specific `make install` command. This has no impact on kernel security or functionality.
982d30c30eaa2 vmxnet3: correctly report gso type for UDP tunnels
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functionality/compatibility fix rather than a security vulnerability. The commit fixes vmxnet3 to correctly report GSO type flags (SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL or SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM) for UDP tunnel packets to maintain compatibility with kernel commit 3d010c8031e3.
  2. **Limited security impact**: Unlike the similar CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples, this issue:
     - Does not cause kernel crashes or BUG_ON triggers
     - Does not lead to memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - Does not cause packet data leaks or privilege escalation
     - Is primarily about proper packet type identification for processing
  3. **Defensive check, not vulnerability**: The referenced commit 3d010c8031e3 added defensive checks to prevent incorrectly typed packets. The vmxnet3 driver was simply not setting the correct type flags, which would result in packets being dropped by these new checks - a functionality issue, not a security issue.
  4. **No exploitation path**: The code changes show this is about setting proper GSO type flags during LRO (Large Receive Offload) processing. There's no path for an attacker to exploit this for malicious purposes.
  5. **Different from CVE examples**: The CVE-assigned examples involve actual packet corruption, potential crashes in skb_segment(), and security boundary violations. This commit merely ensures proper type labeling for compatibility.
  The commit is a important fix for proper network functionality in virtualized environments using UDP tunnels, but does not represent a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
905fe0845bb27 net: wwan: t7xx: Fix napi rx poll issue
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a kernel NULL pointer dereference that leads to a system crash, as shown in the commit message with the BUG report showing "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000f1".
  2. **Race Condition Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a race condition between NAPI RX polling and network device deletion. When a user disconnects, the dellink logic can free the netdev while NAPI polling is still active and trying to use it.
  3. **Security Impact**: This vulnerability can be triggered by user actions (disconnect operation) and results in a kernel crash, which constitutes a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability.
  4. **The Fix**: The commit addresses this by using READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE memory barriers to ensure proper synchronization:
     - In `t7xx_ccmni_wwan_newlink`: `WRITE_ONCE(ctlb->ccmni_inst[if_id], ccmni);`
     - In `t7xx_ccmni_wwan_dellink`: `WRITE_ONCE(ctlb->ccmni_inst[if_id], NULL);`
     - In `t7xx_ccmni_recv_skb`: `ccmni = READ_ONCE(ccmni_ctlb->ccmni_inst[netif_id]);`
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the reference commits that were assigned CVEs - fixing NULL pointer dereferences in network drivers that can be triggered during normal operations (similar to the xen-netfront, mt76, and other network driver fixes shown in the examples).
  The vulnerability allows a local user to cause a kernel crash through normal operations (disconnecting a WWAN device), making it a security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
3382a1ed7f778 net: fix udp gso skb_segment after pull from frag_list
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis of this commit and the kernel tree, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service**: The commit fixes a kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:4278 that causes a system crash. The stack trace in the commit message shows this results in a kernel panic with "Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800". This is a clear DoS vulnerability.
  2. **Remote Exploitability**: The issue can be triggered through network packets. The commit message mentions "Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can modify fraglist skbs" - this means both remote attackers (through crafted packets) and local attackers (through BPF programs) can trigger this vulnerability.
  3. **Different from Previous CVE**: While this commit fixes an issue introduced by commit a1e40ac5b5e9 (which already has CVE status), this represents a new vulnerability. The previous fix addressed NULL pointer dereference in `__udpv4_gso_segment_list_csum`, while this fixes a different code path that causes BUG_ON in `skb_segment`.
  4. **Security Impact**: The vulnerability allows:
     - Remote denial of service through kernel panic
     - Potential memory corruption (the BUG_ON indicates skb structure inconsistency)
     - System instability in production environments
  5. **Affected Components**: This impacts critical networking code paths used by many systems, particularly those using UDP GSO with NAT or BPF programs.
  The fix (`__skb_linearize(gso_skb)`) prevents the vulnerability by consolidating the fragmented skb into a single buffer before segmentation, eliminating the conditions that lead to the kernel BUG.
fd054188999ff um: Fix tgkill compile error on old host OSes
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a build/compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit simply replaces a glibc function call (`tgkill()`) with a direct syscall (`syscall(__NR_tgkill, ...)`) to support older glibc versions that don't have the `tgkill()` wrapper function.
  2. **No security impact**: The change is functionally identical - both the glibc wrapper and the direct syscall do exactly the same thing. There's no change in behavior, no fix for a security vulnerability, and no impact on system security.
  3. **Build-time issue only**: The problem was a compile-time error ("implicit declaration of function 'tgkill'") on systems with glibc < 2.30. This prevented compilation but didn't introduce any runtime security issues.
  4. **UserMode Linux specific**: This code is in the UserMode Linux (UML) subsystem, specifically in the SIGIO workaround implementation. UML is a special case where Linux runs as a userspace process, not affecting regular kernel security.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the "CVE Status: NO" reference commits, this is similar to commit 2 (syscalls: fix sys_fanotify_mark prototype) and commit 4 (syscalls: fix compat_sys_io_pgetevents_time64 usage) which were also compatibility/build fixes without security implications.
  The change is purely a portability fix to allow UML to compile on older systems with older glibc versions. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issue.
0323a5127e7c5 drm/i915/guc: Handle race condition where wakeref count drops below 0
- [sasha] Now I'll analyze this commit based on the information gathered:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a race condition that causes a wakeref count to drop below 0, triggering an `INTEL_WAKEREF_BUG_ON()` check. From the header file, I can see that `INTEL_WAKEREF_BUG_ON` is defined as:
     - `BUG_ON(expr)` when `CONFIG_DRM_I915_DEBUG` is enabled
     - `BUILD_BUG_ON_INVALID(expr)` otherwise
  2. **Security Impact**: There is no security vulnerability here:
     - The issue only occurs in debug builds where it triggers a BUG_ON (kernel panic)
     - In production builds, the macro compiles to BUILD_BUG_ON_INVALID which has no runtime effect
     - This is purely a reference counting bug that affects system stability in debug builds only
  3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE assigned) fixed a deadlock in interrupt context - a real production issue
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE assigned) fixed a race condition in xe driver that caused actual functional problems
     - This commit only fixes a debug assertion failure
  4. **Code Changes**: The fix adds proper state checking (`context_destroyed(ce)`) before performing the wakeref put to avoid double-decrement. This is a correctness fix, not a security fix.
  5. **Attack Vector**: There is no exploitable attack vector. This is an internal kernel race condition that cannot be triggered by unprivileged users and has no security implications.
  The commit is fixing a legitimate bug in the reference counting logic, but it's a quality/stability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The worst outcome is a kernel panic in debug builds, which is not a security concern.
57d63c6cd0851 drm/i915/psr: Fix using wrong mask in REG_FIELD_PREP
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a simple copy-paste error in macro definitions where the wrong mask was used in `REG_FIELD_PREP`. Specifically:
  1. The bug: Both `PORT_ALPM_LFPS_CTL_FIRST_LFPS_HALF_CYCLE_DURATION` and `PORT_ALPM_LFPS_CTL_LAST_LFPS_HALF_CYCLE_DURATION` macros were incorrectly using `PORT_ALPM_LFPS_CTL_LFPS_HALF_CYCLE_DURATION_MASK` instead of their respective masks.
  2. The fix: Changed them to use the correct masks:
     - `PORT_ALPM_LFPS_CTL_FIRST_LFPS_HALF_CYCLE_DURATION_MASK` for the FIRST macro
     - `PORT_ALPM_LFPS_CTL_LAST_LFPS_HALF_CYCLE_DURATION_MASK` for the LAST macro
  3. Security impact analysis:
     - These macros are used in display/graphics code for Intel i915 Panel Self Refresh (PSR) functionality
     - The bug would cause incorrect bit field preparation when writing to hardware registers
     - This is a functional bug in display configuration, not a security vulnerability
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure risks
     - The worst case would be incorrect display behavior or power management issues
  This is similar to the reference commits which also dealt with display driver bugs (register configuration, power management, display features) that were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
c557fd1050f66 drm/i915/guc: Check if expecting reply before decrementing outstanding_submission_g2h
- [sasha] Now let me examine similar commits that were marked as not needing CVEs to compare the nature of this fix.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Bug Type**: This is a logic error in reference counting, not a security vulnerability. The bug causes `outstanding_submission_g2h` to be incorrectly decremented when a message send fails, even if no increment occurred (when `g2h_len_dw` is 0).
  2. **Impact**: The incorrect decrement could lead to:
     - An underflow in the atomic counter
     - Potential premature wake-ups in `intel_guc_wait_for_idle()`
     - Incorrect idle state detection
  3. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: This is internal driver state management within the i915 GPU driver. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Denial of service beyond driver functionality issues
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This fix is similar in nature to the referenced commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO":
     - Like commit 3 (drm/xe: Properly handle alloc_guc_id() failure), this fixes error handling logic
     - Like commit 4 (drm/amdgpu/pm: Check return value), this adds proper error checking
     - The fix is a simple conditional check addition: `if (ret && g2h_len_dw)` instead of just `if (ret)`
  5. **Driver Internal Logic**: The bug affects only the internal synchronization mechanism between the GPU driver and the GuC firmware, not any security-sensitive operations.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for driver correctness and reliability, but it does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
ead7f9b8de656 bpf: Fix L4 csum update on IPv6 in CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional bug that causes incorrect checksum calculations for IPv6 packets when using BPF helpers, but it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. The bug results in invalid `skb->csum` values, which would cause packet drops or checksum verification failures, not security exploits.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The issue only affects a specific use case:
     - When using `bpf_csum_diff` + `bpf_l4_csum_replace` together
     - On IPv6 packets 
     - In `CHECKSUM_COMPLETE` mode
     - For reverse SNAT operations
  3. **Incorrect Calculation, Not Memory Corruption**: The code shows that the bug is in the checksum calculation logic. In the `inet_proto_csum_replace_by_diff` function:
     ```c
     if (skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_COMPLETE && pseudohdr)
         skb->csum = ~csum_sub(diff, skb->csum);
     ```
     This line incorrectly updates `skb->csum` for IPv6 packets when it shouldn't (as the IPv6 address change and L4 checksum update cancel each other out).
  4. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The fix simply adds a new flag (`BPF_F_IPV6`) to skip the `skb->csum` update for IPv6 packets. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure involved.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, "bpf: Fix link info netfilter flags to populate defrag flag" (CVE Status: NO) is a comparable type of fix - it corrects flag handling without introducing security implications.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves the correctness of checksum handling for IPv6 packets in BPF programs, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it does not represent a security vulnerability.
5a15a050df714 bpf: Clarify the meaning of BPF_F_PSEUDO_HDR
- [sasha] Now let me understand what the commit message says about the issue:
  Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a **documentation-only change** that clarifies the meaning of the `BPF_F_PSEUDO_HDR` flag in the `bpf_l4_csum_replace` helper function. The changes are:
  1. **Only modifies comments** in `include/uapi/linux/bpf.h` and `tools/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h`
  2. Changes the description from "the checksum is to be computed against a pseudo-header" to "that the modified header field is part of the pseudo-header"
  3. **No code logic changes** - the actual implementation remains unchanged
  The commit message explains that the clarification is needed because users might misunderstand when to use `BPF_F_PSEUDO_HDR`. The example given (modifying UDP ports with `BPF_F_PSEUDO_HDR` incorrectly updates `skb->csum`) shows this is about preventing user confusion, not fixing a security vulnerability.
  This is similar to the historical commits marked with "CVE Status: NO" that involve:
  - Refactoring without changing behavior (commit 1)
  - Fixing function parameter attributes for correctness (commit 2)
  - Populating informational fields correctly (commit 3)
  Unlike commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) which fixed an actual security issue where packet pointers could be invalidated incorrectly, this commit merely improves documentation clarity without addressing any security vulnerability.
6043b794c7668 net: Fix checksum update for ILA adj-transport
- [sasha] Now I understand the bug better. When ILA performs address translation with CHECKSUM_COMPLETE:
  1. ILA changes the IPv6 destination address
  2. It updates the L4 (TCP/UDP) checksum to compensate for the address change
  3. The bug: it was also updating skb->csum (the hardware-computed checksum cache)
  4. Since the L4 checksum change cancels out the IPv6 address change for checksum purposes, skb->csum shouldn't be modified
  5. The incorrect skb->csum causes __skb_checksum_complete to fail, dropping valid packets
  **NO**
  This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. While it causes legitimate packets to be dropped after ILA translation (a denial of service in the broadest sense), this is:
  1. **Not exploitable by an attacker** - The bug only triggers when ILA translation is configured by the system administrator. An attacker cannot trigger this remotely without admin-configured ILA mappings.
  2. **Limited impact** - It only affects packets that:
     - Are received with CHECKSUM_COMPLETE 
     - Go through ILA translation with adj-transport mode
     - The result is dropped packets, not corruption or unauthorized access
  3. **Configuration-dependent** - Requires specific ILA configuration (adj-transport mode) which is not a default setting
  4. **Similar to reference commits** - The similar commits shown (dst ref loop fixes, GSO fixes) were also marked as NO for CVE assignment, and they had similar or potentially greater impact
  The commit fixes a checksum calculation error that causes functional issues in a specific network configuration scenario, but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
cbefe2ffa7784 net: stmmac: make sure that ptp_rate is not 0 before configuring EST
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Vulnerability - Division by Zero**: The code performs division operations `NSEC_PER_SEC / ptp_rate` at lines 53 and 57 in `stmmac_est.c` without checking if `ptp_rate` is zero. A division by zero will cause a kernel panic/crash.
  2. **Attack Vector**: The `ptp_rate` value comes from `priv->plat->clk_ptp_rate`, which can be 0 when:
     - `clk_get_rate()` fails or returns 0
     - The PTP clock is not properly initialized
     - Hardware/platform-specific issues cause the clock rate to be invalid
  3. **Impact**: This vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) through kernel panic when EST (Enhanced Scheduled Traffic) is configured with an invalid PTP rate.
  4. **Similar Pattern to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES", they also fixed division by zero vulnerabilities:
     - The first two similar commits fixed a zero-division error in `tc_setup_cbs()` where `port_transmit_rate_kbps` could be 0
     - Both were assigned CVEs for fixing similar division by zero issues
  5. **Exploitability**: While this may require specific hardware configurations or timing conditions, it's a clear security vulnerability that can crash the kernel, making it worthy of a CVE assignment.
  The fix adds a proper validation check (`if (!ptp_rate)`) before the division operations, preventing the kernel crash and returning an appropriate error instead.
030ce919e114a net: stmmac: make sure that ptp_rate is not 0 before configuring timestamping
- [sasha] Now let me look at the actual traces shown in the commit message more carefully. The stack trace shows:
  1. Division by zero occurs in `stmmac_init_tstamp_counter`
  2. At line 813: `temp = div_u64(1000000000ULL, sec_inc);`
  3. And at line 824: `priv->default_addend = div_u64(temp, priv->plat->clk_ptp_rate);`
  The commit adds a check to prevent the issue. Let me analyze the security impact:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability**: The commit fixes a division by zero error that causes a kernel panic/crash, which is a clear DoS vulnerability. The stack trace in the commit message shows "Division by zero in kernel" which crashes the system.
  2. **Easily triggerable**: The vulnerability can be triggered during normal network interface initialization when PTP (Precision Time Protocol) timestamping is enabled but `clk_ptp_rate` is 0. This can happen with certain hardware configurations or device tree settings.
  3. **Remote triggerable potential**: While the initial trigger might require local configuration, once a vulnerable system is configured with PTP enabled and clk_ptp_rate=0, bringing up the network interface (which could be triggered remotely in some scenarios) would crash the system.
  4. **Security boundary violation**: A kernel crash represents a violation of the availability security property, making this a legitimate security vulnerability rather than just a bug.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 5 (CVE Status: YES) also fixed a division by zero error in the same driver (`net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs`), establishing precedent that division by zero errors in kernel network drivers warrant CVE assignment.
  The fix properly validates that `priv->plat->clk_ptp_rate` is non-zero before proceeding with PTP configuration, preventing both direct division by zero (line 824) and indirect division by zero through `sec_inc` (line 813).
efdddc4484859 net: dsa: tag_brcm: legacy: fix pskb_may_pull length
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Buffer Overread Vulnerability**: The code was incorrectly using `BRCM_LEG_PORT_ID` (value: 0xf or 15) instead of `BRCM_LEG_TAG_LEN + VLAN_HLEN` (6 + 4 = 10 bytes) in the `pskb_may_pull()` check. However, the code later accesses `brcm_tag[5]`, which requires at least 6 bytes to be available.
  2. **Security Impact**: This creates a buffer overread vulnerability where:
     - The code validates that only 4 bytes are available (BRCM_LEG_PORT_ID was mistakenly used as a length)
     - But then reads byte at index 5 (6th byte), potentially reading beyond the validated buffer
     - This can lead to kernel memory disclosure or crashes
  3. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 4 (brcmfmac NULL pointer dereference) - Got CVE for kernel crash potential
     - Commit 5 (smsc75xx packet length validation) - Got CVE for buffer overread/memory leak
     - This vulnerability is very similar to commit 5 - both involve incorrect length validation leading to potential memory disclosure
  4. **Exploitability**: The vulnerability can be triggered by:
     - Sending specially crafted packets to a DSA-enabled network interface
     - Packets with specific sizes that pass the incorrect validation but lack sufficient data
     - This is accessible from the network, making it remotely exploitable
  5. **Impact**: Potential for:
     - Kernel memory disclosure (reading 2 bytes beyond validated buffer)
     - Denial of Service through kernel crashes when accessing unmapped memory
     - Information leak of kernel heap contents
  The fix correctly changes the validation to ensure sufficient bytes are available before accessing the tag data, preventing the buffer overread vulnerability.
9dc63d8ff1821 idpf: avoid mailbox timeout delays during reset
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The code changes fix operational timeout delays (up to 60 seconds) that occur when mailbox operations are attempted during device reset. This is a quality/reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.
  The fix involves calling `idpf_vc_xn_shutdown()` to properly shut down the virtchannel transaction manager before reset, preventing these long delays. However, there is no security impact - no memory corruption, null pointer dereferences, privilege escalation, or exploitable denial of service. The timeouts are expected behavior when operations conflict with reset operations, not a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker.
7292af042bcf2 idpf: fix a race in txq wakeup
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now make a determination.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a race condition in the TX queue wakeup logic that can cause performance degradation (queue stops when it shouldn't), not a security vulnerability. The commit message explicitly describes reproducing it with aggressive packet generation to stress the system.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The race condition results in:
     - TX queue unnecessarily stopping when resources are actually available
     - Potential performance degradation under high load
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  3. **Code pattern**: The fix replaces a broken implementation of the lockless queue stop/wake paradigm with the correct one using `netif_subqueue_maybe_stop()`. The old code was splitting the resource checks across multiple evaluations:
     ```c
     // Old broken pattern - checks split across multiple evaluations
     if (idpf_tx_maybe_stop_common(tx_q, descs_needed))
         goto out;
     if (unlikely(IDPF_TX_COMPLQ_PENDING(...)))
         goto splitq_stop;
     if (unlikely(IDPF_TX_BUF_RSV_LOW(tx_q)))
         goto splitq_stop;
     ```
     The fix consolidates all checks into a single atomic evaluation via `idpf_txq_has_room()`.
  4. **Similar commits reference**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) all deal with TX queue management and performance issues, none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Fix type**: This is a correctness fix for a performance/reliability issue under load, not a security fix. The paradigm being fixed is well-documented in the kernel as a pattern for "lockless queue stopping/waking" to avoid races, but failures result in performance issues, not security issues.
73145e6d81070 ice: fix rebuilding the Tx scheduler tree for large queue counts
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a functional bug in the Intel ice network driver's Tx scheduler tree algorithm, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes an issue where the driver fails to properly rebuild the scheduler tree when adding XDP (eXpress Data Path) transmit queues on systems with many CPUs.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The errors mentioned in the commit message:
     - "Failed VSI LAN queue config for XDP, error: -5" (-EIO)
     - "Failed to set LAN Tx queue context, error: -22" (-EINVAL)
     
     These are configuration failures that prevent XDP queues from being added, resulting in a denial of functionality rather than a security issue.
  3. **Code changes examination**: The fix involves:
     - Adding `ice_sched_find_next_vsi_node()` to properly traverse VSI nodes
     - Modifying `ice_sched_add_nodes_to_layer()` to use the new traversal function
     - Adding `ice_sched_recalc_vsi_support_nodes()` to calculate needed VSI support nodes
     - Updating `ice_sched_rm_vsi_subtree()` to properly remove all VSI nodes
  4. **No security implications**: The changes are purely algorithmic improvements to handle queue allocation correctly. There's no:
     - Memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote code execution potential
     - Access control bypass
  5. **Similar to CVE-marked commit #2**: While this commit shares some structural similarities with the CVE-assigned commit about queue configuration, the key difference is that the CVE commit fixed a crash/memory corruption ("general protection fault"), while this commit only fixes a functional limitation that causes operations to fail cleanly with error codes.
  The commit improves the driver's ability to handle configurations with many queues but does not address any security vulnerability.
6fa2942578472 ice: create new Tx scheduler nodes for new queues only
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is a logic error in the Tx scheduler tree calculation algorithm. The code incorrectly computes the tree structure for all queues (existing + new) instead of just the new queues being added. This is an efficiency/correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The commit message and code changes show this is about incorrect calculation of scheduler nodes:
     - Before: `ice_sched_calc_vsi_child_nodes(hw, new_numqs, new_num_nodes)`
     - After: `ice_sched_calc_vsi_child_nodes(hw, new_numqs - prev_numqs, new_num_nodes)`
     
     This causes unnecessary node creation in the scheduler tree but doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) involves a crash/GPF due to invalid pointer access after configuration failure
     - This commit just creates extra scheduler nodes which is inefficient but not dangerous
  4. **Security implications**: The bug doesn't:
     - Allow unauthorized access
     - Cause memory corruption or crashes
     - Lead to information leakage
     - Enable privilege escalation
     - Create a denial of service condition
  5. **Code behavior**: The scheduler simply creates more nodes than necessary (e.g., 272 instead of 144 in the example), which is a resource management issue but not a security vulnerability.
  This is a functional bug that affects performance/efficiency of the scheduler tree management, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
0153f36041b8e ice: fix Tx scheduler error handling in XDP callback
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Kernel crash/DoS vulnerability**: The commit message clearly shows this fixes a crash that results in a "general protection fault" with a full kernel oops trace. This represents a denial of service vulnerability where XDP operations can crash the kernel.
  2. **Incomplete error handling leading to memory corruption**: The bug involves incomplete rollback of XDP queue setup on error paths. When `ice_cfg_vsi_lan()` fails, the code was not properly unmapping XDP rings from interrupt vectors, leaving the system in an inconsistent state. This leads to accessing invalid memory later (as shown by the non-canonical address `0x50a2250a90495525` in the oops).
  3. **Exploitable through unprivileged operations**: XDP program loading can be triggered through standard network operations that don't require special privileges beyond CAP_NET_ADMIN, making this exploitable by users with network configuration access.
  4. **Clear security impact**: The crash trace shows the fault occurs in interrupt context (`__ice_update_sample+0x39/0xe0`) during NAPI polling, which is a critical kernel path. The invalid memory access could potentially be leveraged for more than just DoS.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 2 ("ice: protect XDP configuration with a mutex") was assigned a CVE for a race condition that could also cause crashes. This commit fixes a similar class of issue - improper state management leading to kernel crashes.
  The key code changes that fix the vulnerability:
  - Addition of `ice_unmap_xdp_rings()` function to properly clean up mappings
  - Changing the error path from `goto clear_xdp_rings` to `goto unmap_xdp_rings` after `ice_cfg_vsi_lan()` failure
  - Setting `vsi->xdp_rings = NULL` after cleanup to prevent use-after-free
  - Adding early return on ring preparation failure in `ice_xdp_setup_prog()`
03dba9cea72f9 Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix not responding with L2CAP_CR_LE_ENCRYPTION
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a protocol compliance fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes the response code sent when a connection request is made with insufficient security - changing from `L2CAP_CR_LE_AUTHENTICATION` to `L2CAP_CR_LE_ENCRYPTION` when `BT_SECURITY_MEDIUM` is set.
  2. **No security bypass**: The code still properly checks security with `smp_sufficient_security()` and rejects the connection if security is insufficient. The only change is which specific rejection code is returned - both codes result in connection rejection.
  3. **Qualification test compliance**: The commit message explicitly states this is to pass a Bluetooth qualification test (L2CAP/LE/CFC/BV-25-C), indicating this is about protocol compliance rather than fixing a security issue.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: The change doesn't allow any unauthorized access or bypass any security checks. It merely corrects the error code to properly distinguish between needing encryption (security mode 2) vs needing authentication (higher security modes).
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, protocol compliance fixes and response code corrections (like "Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix L2CAP_ECRED_CONN_RSP response") were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The fix ensures the correct error response is sent according to the Bluetooth specification, but it doesn't fix any condition that could be exploited to compromise security.
03f1700b9b4d4 Bluetooth: MGMT: reject malformed HCI_CMD_SYNC commands
- [sasha] Now I understand the vulnerability. Let me trace through the data flow:
  1. In `mgmt_hci_cmd_sync`, the code receives a `struct mgmt_cp_hci_cmd_sync *cp` with:
     - `params_len` field indicating how many bytes of params should follow
     - `params[]` flexible array member containing the actual parameter data
  2. The old validation only checked if `len < sizeof(*cp)` (which is 6 bytes - the fixed part), but didn't verify that the actual data buffer contains enough bytes for the declared `params_len`.
  3. In `send_hci_cmd_sync`, the code passes `cp->params_len` and `cp->params` to `__hci_cmd_sync_ev`.
  4. Eventually in `hci_cmd_sync_alloc`, the code does `skb_put_data(skb, param, plen)` which copies `plen` bytes from `param`.
  The vulnerability is that if `cp->params_len` is larger than the actual number of bytes available in the `params[]` array (i.e., `len - offsetof(struct mgmt_cp_hci_cmd_sync, params)`), then `skb_put_data` will read beyond the allocated buffer, causing an out-of-bounds read.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability where malformed HCI_CMD_SYNC commands could cause the kernel to read beyond the allocated buffer. The fix properly validates that the total size of the received data matches the expected size (fixed header + declared params_len). Without this check, an attacker could specify a large `params_len` value that exceeds the actual data provided, causing `skb_put_data()` to read from memory beyond the allocated buffer boundaries. This is a clear security vulnerability that could potentially lead to information disclosure or system instability.
3d6d84c8f2f66 spi: bcm63xx-hsspi: fix shared reset
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the key logic at line 799-800. The WARN_ON will trigger and return -EBUSY if:
  - An existing reset control is exclusive (!rstc->shared) and someone tries to get it as exclusive (!shared)
  - Or an existing reset control is shared (rstc->shared) and someone tries to get it as exclusive (!shared)
  - Or vice versa
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit changes `devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive()` to `devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared()`. This is fixing a functional issue where two SPI controllers (regular SPI and HSSPI) share the same reset line on certain Broadcom SoCs (bcm6362, bcm63268).
  2. **No security impact**: The issue being fixed is that when both drivers try to get exclusive access to the same reset line, the second one would fail with -EBUSY. This is a resource conflict issue that prevents proper driver initialization, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-4 are all SPI driver fixes for functional issues (mode settings, revert of problematic changes, missing pm_runtime_disable, native CS probing) - none assigned CVEs
     - Only commit 5 (phy: qcom-qmp: fix reset-controller leak) was assigned a CVE, but that was a resource leak which could potentially lead to denial of service
  4. **Code analysis confirms**: The device tree files show both `lsspi` and `hsspi` controllers use the same reset line (`BCM6362_RST_SPI` or `BCM63268_RST_SPI`). The kernel's reset control framework correctly prevents multiple exclusive users of the same reset line, which is what was causing the functional failure.
  This is purely a driver compatibility fix to allow proper hardware initialization on specific SoC models where the hardware design shares reset lines between controllers.
5ad20e3d8cfe3 spi: bcm63xx-spi: fix shared reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit changes the reset control from exclusive to shared, which is a functional fix, not a security fix. The issue being fixed is that some SoCs (bcm6362, bcm63268) share the same reset line between SPI and HSSPI controllers, and using exclusive reset control prevents both drivers from properly initializing.
  2. **No security impact**: The code change simply switches from:
     ```c
     reset = devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive(dev, NULL);
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     reset = devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared(dev, NULL);
     ```
     This doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues.
  3. **Functional/compatibility issue**: The problem this fixes is a driver initialization failure when both SPI and HSSPI drivers try to claim exclusive access to the same reset line. This is a functionality issue that prevents the drivers from working properly on certain hardware configurations, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed SPI controller initialization by properly writing control register values
     - Similar Commit 2 (NO CVE): Fixed controller enable/disable ordering  
     - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): Fixed GPIO provider lookup for certain configurations
     All these are functional fixes without security implications, just like this commit.
  The commit is a straightforward hardware compatibility fix that allows two drivers to share a reset line on specific SoC models, with no security implications whatsoever.
9f346f7d4ea73 md/raid1,raid10: don't handle IO error for REQ_RAHEAD and REQ_NOWAIT
- [sasha] Now let me provide my CVE assessment based on the analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The problem is that RAID1/RAID10 were incorrectly handling IO failures for REQ_RAHEAD (read-ahead) and REQ_NOWAIT (non-blocking) requests by treating them like normal IO errors, leading to unnecessary error recovery actions.
  2. **Performance/correctness issue**: The impact is primarily:
     - Performance degradation when read-ahead operations fail (which is expected behavior for speculative reads)
     - Incorrect behavior for REQ_NOWAIT operations that might block instead of failing immediately
     - Unnecessary badblock recording for transient failures
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: There's no:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control bypass
     - Data corruption affecting integrity
  4. **Expected failure handling**: The commit message explicitly states that IOs with REQ_RAHEAD or REQ_NOWAIT "can fail early, even if the storage medium is fine". This is documented, expected behavior - not a vulnerability.
  5. **Test case context**: The issue was found by an LVM2 test (lvcreate-large-raid) where dm-zero intentionally fails read-ahead IO. This is a test scenario, not an exploitable condition.
  The commit is a bug fix that prevents inappropriate error handling for specific IO types that are expected to fail without consequences. While it fixes incorrect behavior introduced by commit e879a0d9cb08, it doesn't address a security vulnerability.
27eab4c644236 net: lan966x: Make sure to insert the vlan tags also in host mode
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The bug being fixed is a functional issue where VLAN-tagged traffic fails to work properly when the lan966x interface is in host mode. The root cause is that the hardware wasn't configured to insert VLAN tags even though the driver was extracting them from the skb metadata.
  Key reasons this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. The bug causes legitimate VLAN traffic to fail (ping doesn't work), which is a denial of functionality, not a security issue
  2. There's no VLAN bypass, hopping, or unauthorized access to other VLANs
  3. The fix simply configures the hardware rewriter (REW_TAG_CFG) to properly insert VLAN tags for non-zero VIDs
  4. No security boundaries are violated - traffic simply doesn't flow when it should
  This is a straightforward functional bug fix for proper VLAN operation, not a security vulnerability fix.
54d34165b4f78 net/mlx4_en: Prevent potential integer overflow calculating Hz
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a theoretical integer overflow in timestamp calculation code. The overflow occurs when `freq_khz * 1000` exceeds the u32 range (4,294,967,295), which happens when the frequency is above ~4.29 GHz.
  2. **No security impact**: The overflow affects the calculation of `max_val_cycles`, which is used to determine the shift value for timestamp calculations. Even if an overflow occurs:
     - The value is immediately assigned to a u64 variable (`max_val_cycles`)
     - This would result in an incorrect (smaller) value for `max_val_cycles`
     - This leads to a suboptimal shift calculation, potentially affecting timestamp precision
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or denial of service
  3. **Limited exploitability**: 
     - The `hca_core_clock` value comes from hardware capabilities, not user input
     - An attacker cannot control this value
     - The hardware would need to report a frequency >4.29 GHz to trigger the overflow
  4. **Functional impact only**: The worst-case scenario is incorrect timestamp calculations, which is a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability. It doesn't enable any attacks or compromise system security.
  This is similar to the commits marked "CVE Status: NO" in the examples, particularly the PWM and cpufreq overflow fixes, which were also arithmetic overflows in calculations that didn't have security implications.
ba99c627aac85 driver: net: ethernet: mtk_star_emac: fix suspend/resume issue
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to determine if this represents a security vulnerability.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a suspend/resume hang issue but does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The bug causes the system to hang during suspend/resume when `netif_carrier_off()` is called during link state changes. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Impact**: The issue causes a denial of service (system hang) but only during legitimate suspend/resume operations. There's no:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote exploitation capability
     - Memory corruption
     - Unauthorized access
  3. **Fix mechanism**: The fix simply adds `netif_device_detach()` and `netif_device_attach()` calls during suspend/resume to properly detach the network device from the kernel. This is a standard pattern used in many network drivers to handle suspend/resume correctly.
  4. **Similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1, 2, and 5), none of these suspend/resume related fixes were assigned CVEs, as they are functional bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for a hang condition during normal system operation (suspend/resume), but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
f29ccaa07cf3d net: tipc: fix refcount warning in tipc_aead_encrypt
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the full context. Let me analyze whether this commit deserves a CVE.
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **This is fixing a warning, not a security vulnerability**: The commit specifically states it's fixing a "refcount warning" - not a use-after-free or other security issue. The warning is triggered when `get_net()` is called on a network namespace with refcount=0.
  2. **The original security issue was already fixed**: The previous commit (e279024617134) fixed the actual slab-use-after-free vulnerability by adding proper reference counting. That commit likely deserves a CVE as it fixed a real security issue.
  3. **This is a correctness fix**: The new commit changes `get_net()` to `maybe_get_net()` to handle the edge case where the namespace is already being destroyed (refcount=0). This prevents a warning but doesn't fix a security vulnerability - it just makes the code more robust by checking if the namespace is still valid before incrementing the reference.
  4. **No security impact**: If `maybe_get_net()` returns NULL (namespace being destroyed), the code returns -ENODEV early, which is the correct behavior. There's no memory corruption, use-after-free, or other security issue here.
  5. **The code change shows defensive programming**: The change from:
     ```c
     get_net(aead->crypto->net);
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     if (!maybe_get_net(aead->crypto->net)) {
         tipc_bearer_put(b);
         rc = -ENODEV;
         goto exit;
     }
     ```
     This properly handles the case where the namespace is being torn down, avoiding the refcount warning.
  This is similar to other commits that fix warnings or improve error handling without addressing actual security vulnerabilities. The original commit (e279024617134) that fixed the slab-use-after-free is the one that addressed the security issue.
f41a94aade120 gve: Fix RX_BUFFERS_POSTED stat to report per-queue fill_cnt
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a statistics reporting bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The code change fixes an incorrect indexing issue where `priv->rx[0].fill_cnt` was always used instead of `priv->rx[idx].fill_cnt`. This means all RX queues were incorrectly reporting the fill_cnt value from queue 0.
  2. **Impact**: This is purely a statistics/monitoring issue. The `fill_cnt` represents the "free-running total number of descriptors and buffers posted" for each RX queue. The bug causes incorrect per-queue statistics to be reported to userspace or the hypervisor.
  3. **No security implications**: 
     - There's no memory corruption or out-of-bounds access
     - No information disclosure of sensitive data
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No denial of service impact
     - The actual packet processing and driver functionality are unaffected
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits 3 and 4 which also fixed statistics reporting issues were marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern - it's fixing incorrect statistics reporting without any security impact.
  5. **Unlike CVE-worthy commits**: The similar commits marked as "CVE Status: YES" (commits 1 and 2) fixed an actual out-of-bounds array access issue that could lead to invalid memory access, which is a genuine security vulnerability.
  This is simply a quality/correctness issue in the driver's statistics reporting functionality, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
eb7fd7aa35bfc net: stmmac: platform: guarantee uniqueness of bus_id
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a functionality problem, not a security vulnerability. When multiple stmmac devices lack ethernet aliases and use the default bus_id of 0, they fail to register their MDIO buses properly due to naming conflicts. This results in probe failures, not any security compromise.
  2. **Denial of Service Classification**: While the duplicate bus_id prevents proper device initialization, this is a boot-time configuration issue that causes devices to fail to probe. It doesn't allow remote exploitation, privilege escalation, or data compromise. The kernel's device registration simply fails with an error when duplicate names are attempted.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The issue only affects systems with:
     - Multiple stmmac ethernet controllers
     - Missing ethernet aliases in device tree
     - No security boundary is crossed
  4. **Configuration Issue**: This is fundamentally a device tree configuration problem that can be worked around by properly setting ethernet aliases. The fix improves robustness but doesn't close a security hole.
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the provided similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern - it's a driver fix for proper hardware initialization/configuration rather than a security issue.
  The code change simply ensures unique bus_id generation by maintaining a static counter when aliases are not provided, preventing MDIO bus registration conflicts. This is a quality/functionality improvement, not a security fix.
271683bb2cf32 page_pool: Fix use-after-free in page_pool_recycle_in_ring
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Clear Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's page_pool subsystem, as evidenced by:
     - KASAN detection of slab-use-after-free
     - Detailed stack trace showing the vulnerability path
     - Clear explanation of the race condition
  2. **Exploitable Race Condition**: The vulnerability involves a race between:
     - `page_pool_recycle_in_ring()` which holds `producer_lock` while recycling pages
     - `page_pool_release()` which can free the entire pool structure
     - After the pool is freed, the producer thread tries to unlock `producer_lock` on freed memory
  3. **Remote Trigger Potential**: The stack trace shows this can be triggered through network packet processing paths, making it potentially exploitable remotely through crafted network traffic.
  4. **Security Impact**:
     - Kernel crashes (DoS)
     - Potential for more severe exploitation through use-after-free
     - Affects core networking infrastructure (page_pool is used by high-performance network drivers)
  5. **Similar to Other CVE-assigned Commits**: This matches the pattern of the similar commits shown which received CVEs:
     - Clear use-after-free vulnerability
     - Syzbot detection with KASAN
     - Race condition fixes
     - Affects kernel memory management
  6. **The Fix**: The patch adds proper synchronization by acquiring the producer lock in `page_pool_release()` to ensure all producers have exited before destroying the pool, preventing the UAF condition.
  The changes show adding `page_pool_producer_lock/unlock` calls in `page_pool_release()` and modifying `page_pool_recycle_in_ring()` to use the same locking mechanism consistently, which directly addresses the race condition that causes the use-after-free vulnerability.
8542d6fac25c0 Fix sock_exceed_buf_limit not being triggered in __sk_mem_raise_allocated
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis:
  **NO**, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a functional regression that affects system observability/debugging capabilities, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a bug where the `trace_sock_exceed_buf_limit` tracepoint fails to fire for SK_MEM_RECV allocations when processes are not part of any cgroup. 
  Key reasons this is not a security issue:
  1. **No memory corruption or safety issues** - The bug only affects whether a debug tracepoint fires
  2. **No bypass of security controls** - All memory limits and allocation controls work correctly
  3. **No information disclosure** - The tracepoint only exposes standard socket memory statistics already available through /proc
  4. **No denial of service** - Memory accounting and limits continue to function properly
  5. **Impact limited to debugging/monitoring** - Only affects visibility into buffer limit events for system administrators
  The regression simply causes missing trace events that would be useful for debugging network memory pressure situations, making it a quality/functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
40493d97b329f drm/xe: Add missing documentation of rpa_freq
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit only adds missing documentation comments to explain the `rpa_freq` (Render Performance A level) frequency parameter. The changes are purely in code comments within the DOC block - no actual code execution paths are modified. This is a documentation-only fix that has no security implications, as it doesn't change any functionality, fix any vulnerabilities, or alter any security boundaries. The "Fixes:" tag simply indicates it's correcting missing documentation from a previous commit, not fixing a security issue.
55f8aa083604c drm/xe: Make xe_gt_freq part of the Documentation
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is purely a documentation fix that:
  1. **Only modifies documentation files**: Adds `Documentation/gpu/xe/index.rst` and `Documentation/gpu/xe/xe_gt_freq.rst`
  2. **Only changes comment formatting**: In `drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_gt_freq.c`, only the DOC comment block is modified by fixing indentation and adding blank lines between list items
  3. **No executable code changes**: The commit does not alter any functional code, driver logic, or security controls
  The commit is addressing a documentation build warning by properly integrating the xe_gt_freq component documentation into the kernel documentation system. This is routine maintenance with no security implications.
fd03f82a026cc drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Fix clk-disable removal
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this is what happened:
  1. Commit 6579a03e68ff removed the `err_disable_clk` label and all `goto err_disable_clk` statements
  2. However, commit e5e9fa9f7aad (which added AUX bus support) was merged before 6579a03e68ff but introduced new code paths with `goto err_disable_clk`
  3. This created a **build breakage** where the code tries to jump to a non-existent label
  The current patch fixes this build breakage by removing the remaining `goto err_disable_clk` statement that was introduced after the original cleanup patch was created.
  **CVE Analysis:**
  NO
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It fixes a build breakage caused by conflicting patches being merged in the wrong order. The issue is:
  1. **Not a runtime bug**: This would cause a compile-time error, not a runtime vulnerability
  2. **No security impact**: The change simply removes a goto statement to a non-existent label, which would prevent the code from compiling
  3. **Pure build fix**: This is a mechanical fix to resolve a merge conflict issue where one patch removed a label that another patch (merged earlier but created later) was trying to use
  The commit is purely fixing a build regression introduced by the interaction of two patches, with no security implications whatsoever.
e5e9fa9f7aad4 drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Add support to get panel from the DP AUX bus
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context from the kernel tree:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The commit is adding support for getting panels from the DP AUX bus for eDP panels. This is a new feature enhancement that moves initialization earlier to support panel probing, not a fix for an existing security vulnerability.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Being Fixed**: Unlike the historical commit example #5 (which was assigned a CVE for fixing a NULL pointer dereference), this commit doesn't fix any existing bug that could be exploited. The code changes show:
     - Moving `drm_dp_aux_init()` from `bind()` to `probe()`
     - Moving runtime PM setup from `bind()` to `probe()`
     - These are architectural changes to support the new feature
  3. **Proper Initialization Order**: While there were previous commits (2d192f4a3acc, 3efe2ace7f5b) that fixed race conditions in this driver, this current commit is building on top of those fixes, not addressing a new vulnerability. The initialization order changes here are to enable panel detection during probe, not to fix a security issue.
  4. **No Attack Vector**: The changes don't expose or fix any attack vectors. They simply reorganize when certain initialization happens to support the new panel detection feature.
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-4 (marked NO CVE) are feature additions or enhancements
     - Commit 5 (marked YES CVE) fixed an actual NULL pointer dereference bug
     - This commit aligns with the feature addition pattern, not bug fixing
  The commit is a legitimate architectural change to support eDP panel detection via AUX bus during probe phase, which requires having power management and AUX initialization ready earlier. This is a planned enhancement, not a security vulnerability fix.
c71db051142a7 drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Remove CONFIG_PM related check in analogix_dp_bind()/analogix_dp_unbind()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code cleanup/refactoring commit that:
     - Removes conditional compilation checks for CONFIG_PM
     - Switches from manual pm_runtime_enable/disable to devm_pm_runtime_enable (managed resource)
     - Simplifies the code flow without changing fundamental functionality
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit does not fix any security issues such as:
     - Memory corruption/buffer overflows
     - Information leaks
     - Access control bypasses
     - Race conditions
     - Input validation problems
     - Resource leaks that could lead to DoS
  3. **Code analysis shows**:
     - The old code handled both CONFIG_PM enabled and disabled cases
     - When CONFIG_PM was disabled, it directly called analogix_dp_resume() during bind and analogix_dp_suspend() during unbind
     - The new code assumes CONFIG_PM is always available and uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() for automatic cleanup
     - This is a modernization that relies on CONFIG_PM being standard in modern kernels
  4. **Similar to the reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they show:
     - Power management adjustments
     - Configuration changes
     - Display driver improvements
     - None of these similar commits were assigned CVEs
  This is a quality-of-life improvement that makes the code cleaner and more maintainable by using the device-managed API (devm_*) pattern, which automatically handles cleanup on device removal. There are no security implications from this change.
4557cc834712e accel/ivpu: Reorder Doorbell Unregister and Command Queue Destruction
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here's my decision:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The ivpu (Intel Vision Processing Unit) driver is an accelerator driver with limited exposure. It requires specific hardware (Intel VPU) and privileged access to submit jobs through the DRM interface.
  2. **Local Access Required**: Exploiting this race condition would require:
     - Local access to the system
     - Permission to open the DRM device and submit jobs
     - Precise timing to trigger the race between doorbell operations and queue destruction
  3. **No Direct Security Boundary Crossing**: The bug affects ordering between host and VPU firmware communication. While it could cause firmware crashes or incorrect behavior, it doesn't directly cross security boundaries or allow privilege escalation on the host system.
  4. **Firmware-Side Impact**: The primary impact is on the VPU firmware side (potential use-after-free), not the host kernel. The firmware runs in an isolated environment.
  5. **Recent Feature**: The bug was introduced in commit 465a3914b254 (Jan 7, 2025), which added new command queue management APIs. This is a very recent feature with limited deployment.
  6. **Quality Issue vs Security Vulnerability**: The commit message describes this as ensuring "compliance with firmware expectations" and preventing "unnecessary NOP operations" rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The impact appears to be functional correctness rather than exploitable security issues.
  While the incorrect ordering could theoretically lead to firmware-side memory corruption, the practical exploitability is very limited due to the required access levels and hardware specificity. This appears to be a quality/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
6579a03e68ffa drm/bridge: analogix_dp: Remove the unnecessary calls to clk_disable_unprepare() during probing
- [sasha] Now I understand the full context. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It's a cleanup/refactoring commit**: The commit removes dead code (the `err_disable_clk` label and associated `clk_disable_unprepare()` calls) that became unreachable after commit f37952339cc2 moved clock management to runtime PM.
  2. **No security vulnerability is introduced or fixed**: The referenced commit f37952339cc2 moved the clock enable from `probe()` to `bind()`/runtime PM. After that change, the clock is never enabled during probe, so the error path attempting to disable it is unnecessary and harmless.
  3. **The code change is purely cosmetic**: Looking at the diff, the commit only:
     - Removes the `err_disable_clk:` label
     - Removes `goto err_disable_clk;` statements
     - Removes the `clk_disable_unprepare(dp->clock);` call in the error path
     - Changes error returns to direct returns (e.g., `return ERR_CAST()` instead of `goto err_disable_clk`)
  4. **No exploitable condition exists**: Even if the old code path was executed (which it couldn't be), calling `clk_disable_unprepare()` on a clock that was never prepared/enabled would at worst be a no-op or cause a warning, not a security issue.
  5. **Similar to the reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (commits 1-5) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" and they involve similar clock management cleanups without security implications.
  This is a standard kernel cleanup removing unreachable/dead code after a refactoring, with no security impact whatsoever.
be9b3f9a54101 drm/connector: only call HDMI audio helper plugged cb if non-null
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can cause a kernel crash (Oops). Here's why this warrants a CVE:
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug causes a null pointer dereference that leads to a kernel crash/panic when removing HDMI audio drivers. This is a denial of service vulnerability.
  2. **Vulnerability Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES", they all fix null pointer dereference issues in DRM/GPU drivers. This commit follows the exact same pattern - fixing a missing NULL check that leads to a crash.
  3. **Trigger Condition**: The vulnerability is triggered during driver removal when `sound/soc/codecs/hdmi-codec.c` calls `hook_plugged_cb` with NULL parameters (as seen in the `hdmi_remove` function). The original code at line 106 unconditionally calls `fn(codec_dev, connector->hdmi_audio.last_state)` without checking if `fn` is NULL.
  4. **Fix**: The patch adds a simple null check (`if (fn)`) before calling the function pointer, preventing the crash.
  5. **Exploitability**: While this requires the ability to remove/unload drivers (typically requiring elevated privileges), it's still a reliability/availability issue that can be triggered programmatically, similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the reference list.
  The commit message explicitly states it produces an "Oops" (kernel crash), and the fix is a classic null pointer dereference prevention, matching the pattern of other CVE-assigned commits in the DRM subsystem.
39d86db34e41b loop: add file_start_write() and file_end_write()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a correctness fix for missing filesystem freeze protection, not a security vulnerability fix. The `file_start_write()` and `file_end_write()` functions provide synchronization with filesystem freeze operations to ensure data consistency.
  2. **No Direct Security Impact**: While the missing calls could theoretically lead to writes during filesystem freeze operations, this would primarily cause:
     - Data consistency issues
     - Potential filesystem corruption in edge cases
     - Issues with backup/snapshot operations
     
     These are reliability/correctness issues rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities.
  3. **Limited Attack Surface**: 
     - Requires local access to use loop devices
     - Cannot be exploited remotely
     - No privilege escalation path
     - No information disclosure
  4. **Context from Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (loop: stop using vfs_iter_{read,write}) - marked NO CVE: Fixed a functional regression
     - Commit 2 (fs: create kiocb_{start,end}_write() helpers) - marked NO CVE: Added helper functions
     - Commits 3 & 4 (netfs: Fix kernel async DIO) - marked YES CVE: Fixed actual crashes/warnings
  5. **Code Analysis**: The change adds proper synchronization calls that were missing when the code switched from using `vfs_iter_write()` (which includes these calls) to direct `->write_iter()` calls. This is a missing synchronization issue, not a security boundary violation.
  The commit fixes a functional correctness issue where loop device writes could potentially interfere with filesystem freeze operations, but this doesn't constitute a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
ae4432e01dd96 USB: typec: fix const issue in typec_match()
- [sasha] Let me look at the actual change more carefully. The commit changes:
  ```c
  -	struct typec_altmode_driver *drv = to_altmode_driver(driver);
  +	const struct typec_altmode_driver *drv = to_altmode_driver(driver);
  ```
  This is changing the type of `drv` from a non-const pointer to a const pointer. The commit message mentions that `typec_match()` was casting away const from its parameter, which is bad practice.
  Looking at the function signature:
  ```c
  static int typec_match(struct device *dev, const struct device_driver *driver)
  ```
  The `driver` parameter is `const`, and when passed to `to_altmode_driver()`, it was likely being cast to non-const inappropriately.
  **Analysis:**
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a const-correctness fix. The function was improperly casting away the const qualifier from a pointer.
  2. **Security implications**: 
     - Casting away const is generally bad practice and could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the code attempts to modify what should be read-only data
     - However, in this specific case, the `drv` pointer is only used for reading (accessing `drv->id_table` in a read-only loop)
     - There's no actual modification of the driver structure
     - The fix prevents potential future bugs but doesn't fix an existing exploitable vulnerability
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" were fixing actual vulnerabilities like NULL pointer dereferences, race conditions, or access control issues
     - This commit is fixing a type safety/const-correctness issue that doesn't have immediate security implications
  4. **Impact assessment**:
     - No crashes, data corruption, or security bypass
     - No privilege escalation or information disclosure
     - Just improves type safety and prevents potential future issues
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a const-correctness fix that improves code quality and type safety but doesn't address an actual security vulnerability. The change prevents casting away const, which is good practice, but there's no evidence of any exploitable security issue being fixed. The function only reads from the driver structure and doesn't attempt to modify it, so the const violation was not causing any actual security problems.
5f5cc794fac60 USB: gadget: udc: fix const issue in gadget_match_driver()
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability.
  The commit message indicates this is fixing a "const issue" where `gadget_match_driver()` was casting away a const pointer. The change itself is simple - changing from:
  ```c
  struct usb_gadget_driver *driver = container_of(drv,
  ```
  to:
  ```c
  const struct usb_gadget_driver *driver = container_of(drv,
  ```
  This is a code quality/correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit:
  1. **Does not fix a security vulnerability** - It's fixing improper const casting, which is a code quality issue
  2. **No security impact** - The function `gadget_match_driver()` only performs string comparisons and boolean checks. It doesn't modify the driver structure, so casting away const was unnecessary but not dangerous
  3. **No memory corruption or access control issues** - The function only reads data for matching purposes
  4. **Part of a larger refactoring** - The commit references fixing issues introduced by a driver core change ("driver core: have match() callback in struct bus_type take a const *")
  Comparing to the similar commits provided:
  - Similar Commit 1 (CVE Status: YES) - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could crash the system
  - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) - Fixed a use-after-free bug that could cause memory corruption
  - Similar Commit 5 (CVE Status: YES) - Fixed a NULL pointer access with race condition
  This commit is fundamentally different - it's a const-correctness fix with no security implications.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a const-correctness fix that addresses a code quality issue introduced by a refactoring change. There is no security vulnerability being fixed - the function only performs read operations for device matching, and improperly casting away const in this context has no security impact.
92cd405b64860 USB: serial: bus: fix const issue in usb_serial_device_match()
- [sasha] Let me analyze this commit to determine if it should be assigned a CVE.
  **Analysis:**
  1. **Nature of the Change:**
     - This commit fixes a const-correctness issue in `usb_serial_device_match()`
     - The function was casting away const from a const pointer parameter
     - The fix changes `struct usb_serial_driver *driver` to `const struct usb_serial_driver *driver`
  2. **Security Implications:**
     - This is a type safety/const-correctness fix
     - The original code was casting away const qualification, which is a code quality issue
     - No actual vulnerability is being fixed - the cast was unnecessary but not exploitable
     - The driver pointer is only used for comparison (`driver == port->serial->type`)
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues are present
  3. **Comparison with Similar Commits:**
     - Similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (like commit 3) also deal with const qualifier additions
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fix actual vulnerabilities like:
       - NULL pointer dereferences (commits 1, 2, 4)
       - Device validation issues that could lead to crashes
       - Input validation problems
  4. **Impact:**
     - This is purely a code cleanliness/correctness issue
     - No functional change in behavior
     - No security boundary is crossed
     - No user-facing impact
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a const-correctness fix that improves code quality but does not address any security vulnerability. The change only affects compile-time type checking and has no runtime security implications. The driver pointer is only used for a simple comparison operation, and casting away const in this context, while poor practice, does not create any exploitable condition.
f62c49d8f32d6 iio: adc: mcp3911: fix device dependent mappings for conversion result registers
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit more carefully. The key issue is in the conversion result register mappings. Looking at the changes:
  1. **Before the fix**: The code was using `MCP3911_CHANNEL(channel->channel)` for all device variants, which uses the formula `MCP3911_REG_CHANNEL0 + (ch) * 3` where `MCP3911_REG_CHANNEL0 = 0x00`.
  2. **After the fix**: The code introduces device-specific `get_raw()` callbacks:
     - For MCP3911: Still uses `MCP3911_CHANNEL(channel)` 
     - For MCP3910 and variants: Uses `MCP3910_CHANNEL(channel)` which is defined as `(MCP3911_REG_CHANNEL0 + (ch))` - notice it's missing the `* 3` multiplication
  This is a critical difference! The MCP3910 family appears to have a different register layout where channel registers are consecutive (offset by 1), while MCP3911 has them spaced by 3 bytes.
  **Security Analysis:**
  This is **NOT a security vulnerability** because:
  1. **No memory safety issues**: The incorrect register mapping would cause reading from wrong registers within the device's register space, not from arbitrary memory locations.
  2. **No privilege escalation**: This is a driver bug that affects functionality (reading incorrect data) but doesn't provide any escalation paths.
  3. **No data corruption of sensitive data**: While incorrect data might be read, it's still within the ADC device's register space.
  4. **Limited impact**: The issue only affects reading ADC values - users would get incorrect/garbage ADC readings from the wrong registers, but this is a functional bug, not a security issue.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE examples**: This is similar to the first example commit (fixing realbits value) which was marked as NO CVE - both are fixing incorrect device configuration that leads to wrong data interpretation.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug where different MCP39xx family devices have different register layouts for channel data. The MCP3911 spaces channel registers by 3 bytes while MCP3910 and variants have consecutive channel registers. Using the wrong mapping would cause reading from incorrect registers, resulting in garbage ADC values, but this is a functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability. There are no memory safety issues, privilege escalation paths, or corruption of sensitive system data.
52c43d80fa837 iio: adc: PAC1934: fix typo in documentation link
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Documentation-only change**: The commit only fixes a typo in a documentation URL comment. The change is from `PAC1934-Integration-Notes` to `PAC193X-Integration-Notes` in a comment that provides a link to an application note.
  2. **No functional code changes**: The actual code logic remains unchanged. This is purely a comment correction that has no impact on:
     - The driver's functionality
     - Security behavior
     - Data processing
     - Access control
     - Memory handling
  3. **No security implications**: Unlike the similar commits with CVE Status: YES (which fixed actual security vulnerabilities like out-of-bounds array accesses), this commit:
     - Does not fix any buffer overflows
     - Does not fix any memory access issues
     - Does not change any array bounds checking
     - Does not modify any data validation
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits that received CVEs all involved fixing actual security vulnerabilities:
     - Similar Commit 1 & 2: Fixed out-of-bounds array index access in `pac1934_read_raw()` function
     - Similar Commit 3: Added sentinel to prevent array out-of-bound access
  This commit is fundamentally different as it only corrects a typo in a documentation reference and has no security relevance whatsoever.
97ce0fe2b7240 mei: vsc: Cast tx_buf to (__be32 *) when passed to cpu_to_be32_array()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a type-casting fix to address sparse warnings. The code changes from casting to `(u32 *)` to casting to `(__be32 *)` to satisfy the type checker.
  2. **No functional impact**: The actual runtime behavior is unchanged. Both casts result in the same memory operations:
     - `cpu_to_be32_array()` expects `__be32 *dst` as first parameter
     - `be32_to_cpu_array()` expects `const __be32 *src` as second parameter
     - The previous cast to `(u32 *)` worked correctly but triggered sparse type warnings
  3. **No security vulnerability**: This is a compile-time type checking issue, not a runtime security issue. There's no:
     - Buffer overflow
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control bypass
     - Information leak
     - Any exploitable condition
  4. **Similar to commit 4**: Like the "serial: max3100: Fix bitwise types" commit (CVE Status: NO), this is fixing sparse warnings about bitwise/endian types without changing the actual behavior.
  5. **Context from commit message**: The commit explicitly states it's fixing "type-check warning in sparse" and that the buffers are being re-used temporarily for a different purpose during ROM transfer, which is why the cast is needed.
  This is a code quality improvement to satisfy static analysis tools, not a security fix.
46a4d12a005c5 char: tlclk: Fix correct sysfs directory path for tlclk
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is purely a documentation update in the Kconfig help text, updating a sysfs path reference from `/sys/devices/platform/telco_clock` to `/sys/devices/faux/telco_clock`. This is simply correcting documentation to reflect a previous refactoring change (commit 72239a78f9f5) that converted the driver from using platform_device to faux_device. 
  The commit contains no actual code changes, no functional modifications, and introduces no security vulnerabilities. It's a benign maintenance commit that only ensures documentation accuracy and has no impact on system security, permissions, or functionality.
7b386d7454b61 misc: lis3lv02d: Fix correct sysfs directory path for lis3lv02d
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the additional context from exploring the kernel tree:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Documentation-only change**: The commit only updates documentation files (Documentation/misc-devices/lis3lv02d.rst and drivers/misc/lis3lv02d/Kconfig help text) to reflect the correct sysfs path after a previous code change.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The changes are purely informational - updating documentation from the old path `/sys/devices/platform/lis3lv02d` to the new path `/sys/devices/faux/lis3lv02d`. This doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  3. **Fixes documentation accuracy**: This is a documentation fix that ensures users and developers have the correct information about where to find the accelerometer sysfs attributes. Having incorrect documentation could cause confusion but doesn't constitute a security issue.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-4 that also made minor changes (adding device IDs, fixing error messages, updating manufacturer info) were marked as "CVE Status: NO"
     - Only Commit 5, which fixed a platform-device leak (memory leak) in an error path, was assigned a CVE
  This commit is most similar to commits 1-4 in that it's a minor documentation/informational update with no security implications.
81e9edc1a8d65 rust: miscdevice: fix typo in MiscDevice::ioctl documentation
- [sasha] Perfect! I can now see the actual typo that this commit is fixing. The word "utilties" on line 124 should be "utilities".
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a simple typo fix in documentation that changes "utilties" to "utilities" in a code comment. The change:
  1. **Only affects documentation** - It's in a comment (line starting with `///`) that explains how to use the ioctl handler
  2. **Has zero security impact** - Documentation changes cannot introduce vulnerabilities
  3. **Does not change any executable code** - The diff shows only a single character change in a comment
  4. **Does not affect kernel behavior** - Comments are stripped during compilation
  This is a pure documentation improvement with no functional or security implications whatsoever. CVEs are reserved for security vulnerabilities, not spelling corrections in comments.
5aac95320d0f1 staging: gpib: Fix secondary address restriction
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a functional bug, it does not address a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  The change removes a call to `gpib_address_restrict()` which was incorrectly mapping secondary address 31 to 0, causing address confusion. However, this is primarily a **functional correctness issue** rather than a security vulnerability for several reasons:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: GPIB drivers are in the staging directory and are used exclusively for controlling test/measurement equipment in controlled environments, not general-purpose computing.
  2. **No Privilege Boundary Crossed**: The bug causes incorrect device addressing within the same privilege context. There's no evidence of privilege escalation, memory corruption, or unauthorized access across security boundaries.
  3. **Hardware-Specific Context**: GPIB secondary addresses are used for addressing measurement instruments on an IEEE-488 bus. Address confusion between devices would cause functional failures but not security breaches.
  4. **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: While the bug could cause commands to go to the wrong instrument, this is a reliability issue in a specialized hardware control context, not a data confidentiality breach.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the format string warning fix (Similar Commit 1) and address preservation fix (Similar Commit 2), which were both marked as NO CVE - they fix functional bugs without security implications.
  The commit fixes a specification compliance issue (secondary addresses should support 0-31, not have 31 remapped to 0) but does not address any exploitable security condition that would warrant a CVE assignment.
034a456869a07 staging: gpib: Fix PCMCIA config identifier
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the changes provided:
  Looking at the commit changes:
  ```diff
  -#ifdef GPIB__PCMCIA
  +#ifdef CONFIG_GPIB_PCMCIA
  ```
  The commit fixes a typo in the preprocessor directive. The original code had `GPIB__PCMCIA` (with double underscore) when it should have been `CONFIG_GPIB_PCMCIA` to match the configuration identifier from gpib/Kconfig.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: This is a simple typo fix in a preprocessor directive that affects build configuration, not runtime behavior. The code inside the `#ifdef` block would never have been compiled due to the incorrect identifier.
  2. **No exploitable condition**: The misspelled identifier `GPIB__PCMCIA` would never be defined, so the code block for PCMCIA cleanup would simply be skipped during compilation. This doesn't create any security vulnerability - it's just dead code that never gets compiled.
  3. **Limited impact**: The affected code is in the module exit function (`ines_exit_module`), which only runs when the module is being unloaded. The missing cleanup code would at worst cause a resource leak when unloading the module, not a security issue.
  4. **Build-time issue**: This is a compile-time configuration issue, not a runtime vulnerability. The incorrect identifier means certain cleanup code was never included in the binary, rather than causing incorrect behavior at runtime.
  While this is indeed a bug that needed fixing (as indicated by the Fixes: tag), it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it doesn't represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
c4c7ead7b86c1 vt: remove VT_RESIZE and VT_RESIZEX from vt_compat_ioctl()
- [sasha] Both VT_RESIZE and VT_RESIZEX require permissions (perm), which means the user must either own the tty or have CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability. This limits who can trigger the issue.
  ## Analysis Summary:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a bug in the compat ioctl handling where VT_RESIZE and VT_RESIZEX were incorrectly categorized as ioctls that treat their argument as an integer, when they actually expect pointers to structures. While this is a legitimate bug that could cause incorrect behavior when 32-bit applications use these ioctls on 64-bit kernels, it does not represent a security vulnerability worthy of a CVE because:
  1. **Limited impact**: The bug would likely result in -EFAULT errors when `get_user()` or `copy_from_user()` try to access the incorrectly converted pointer address, rather than any exploitable condition.
  2. **Permission requirements**: Both affected ioctls require either tty ownership or CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, significantly limiting who can trigger the issue.
  3. **No security boundary crossing**: There's no indication this could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise. The worst case appears to be a failed ioctl call.
  4. **Long-standing bug with no security reports**: The bug has existed since 2009 without any reported security implications, suggesting it manifests as a functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The commit correctly fixes a functionality bug in the compat layer, but does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
408c97c4a5e0b coresight: prevent deactivate active config while enabling the config
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Clear Security Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability that can occur during a race condition between configuration activation/deactivation and device enabling. The commit message clearly states "This could make UAF issue in below scenario."
  2. **Memory Corruption Risk**: The vulnerability allows access to freed memory (`config_desc`) after a module has been unloaded. This is a classic UAF pattern that can lead to:
     - Kernel memory corruption
     - Potential privilege escalation
     - System crashes/DoS
  3. **Exploitable Race Condition**: The detailed race condition scenario in the commit message shows how an attacker could trigger this vulnerability through concurrent operations on different CPUs.
  4. **Reference Counting Fix**: The code changes implement proper reference counting (`cscfg_config_desc_get/put`) to prevent the config descriptor from being freed while still in use, which is a security-critical fix.
  5. **Similar CVE Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 4 (cgroup/cpuset UAF) was assigned a CVE for a similar UAF issue
     - Commit 5 (another cgroup/cpuset UAF) was also assigned a CVE
     - Both involved race conditions leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities
  The vulnerability has real security impact as it could allow a local attacker with appropriate permissions to cause kernel memory corruption through careful timing of sysfs operations and module loading/unloading.
53b9e2659719b coresight: holding cscfg_csdev_lock while removing cscfg from csdev
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Race Condition Leading to Use-After-Free**: The commit explicitly describes a race condition where one CPU is iterating through `config_csdev_list` while another CPU is deleting entries from that same list through `cscfg_remove_owned_csdev_configs()`. This is a classic use-after-free vulnerability in kernel space.
  2. **Security Impact**: The race condition occurs between:
     - CPU0: Enabling a configuration via `cscfg_csdev_enable_active_config()` which holds the lock and iterates the list
     - CPU1: Unloading a module which calls `cscfg_unload_config_sets()` → `cscfg_remove_owned_csdev_configs()` which deletes list entries WITHOUT holding the lock
  3. **Exploitable Scenario**: The commit message shows this can happen through normal sysfs operations:
     - Activating/deactivating configurations via sysfs
     - Loading/unloading kernel modules
     - These are operations that can be performed by users with appropriate privileges
  4. **Kernel Memory Corruption**: When the race is triggered, CPU0 could be accessing freed memory (the deleted list entry), which can lead to:
     - Kernel crashes (DoS)
     - Potential privilege escalation if the freed memory is reallocated and controlled
     - Information disclosure
  5. **Fix Pattern**: The fix adds proper locking (`guard(raw_spinlock_irqsave)(&csdev->cscfg_csdev_lock)`) around the list deletion operations, which is a standard security fix for race conditions.
  This is similar to the "configfs: fix a race in configfs_{,un}register_subsystem()" commit which was assigned a CVE, as both involve race conditions in configuration management that can lead to kernel memory corruption.
895b12b7d7b8c coresight/etm4: fix missing disable active config
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a resource management bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a missing call to `cscfg_csdev_disable_active_config()` in the `etm4_disable_sysfs()` function.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - When enabling via sysfs, `etm4_enable_sysfs()` calls `cscfg_csdev_enable_active_config()` if a configuration is active (lines 827-831)
     - However, when disabling via sysfs, the corresponding `cscfg_csdev_disable_active_config()` was not being called
     - This creates an imbalance in the reference counting mechanism (atomic counters seen in `_cscfg_activate_config` and `_cscfg_deactivate_config`)
  3. **Security implications**: 
     - This is a reference counting bug that could lead to resource leaks
     - There's no evidence of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - The impact is limited to incorrect reference counts which could prevent proper cleanup or configuration changes
     - No user data is exposed, and no security boundaries are crossed
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: All the similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) deal with:
     - Hardware register access fixes
     - Power management issues  
     - State save/restore problems
     - Resource management fixes
     
     None of these were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Code context**: The coresight subsystem is a debugging/tracing infrastructure. While bugs in it should be fixed, a missing disable call that leads to reference count imbalance doesn't constitute a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
  The fix ensures proper cleanup and resource management but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
ee811bc733be5 coresight: etm4x: Fix timestamp bit field handling
- [sasha] Based on my thorough analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Functional Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: This is a regression that breaks timestamp functionality in the CoreSight ETM4x trace driver. The timestamps appear as zeros due to incorrect bit field handling after the TRFCR macro definitions were changed.
  2. **No Security Impact**: 
     - The bug doesn't create any exploitable condition
     - It doesn't expose sensitive information
     - It doesn't allow privilege escalation or unauthorized access
     - It doesn't enable memory corruption or code execution
  3. **Limited Scope**: 
     - Only affects trace debugging/monitoring functionality
     - CoreSight ETM4x is primarily used for debugging and performance analysis
     - The broken timestamps make traces less useful but don't create security risks
  4. **Similar to Historical Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 3 (coresight fixes for register access) - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 4 (ice PHY timestamp extraction fix) - NO CVE
     - Both were functional fixes for timestamp/trace issues without security implications
  5. **Nature of the Fix**: The fix simply corrects bit field manipulation using `FIELD_PREP()` and `FIELD_GET()` macros to properly set timestamp source bits. This is a straightforward coding error correction, not a security patch.
  While this is an important functional fix that restores proper trace timestamping, it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it lacks any security implications or exploitable conditions.
d23bc38e8aa4e coresight: tmc: fix failure to disable/enable ETF after reading
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze the security implications. Let me create a summary of the issue:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a functional bug where the `drvdata->reading` flag can get stuck in the true state if `__tmc_etb_enable_hw()` fails during `tmc_read_unprepare_etb()`. This prevents subsequent enable/disable operations on the ETF (Embedded Trace FIFO) component, but it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug affects the CoreSight debug/trace infrastructure which is typically only accessible to privileged users (root or users with specific debug permissions). The stuck reading flag simply prevents the trace hardware from being re-enabled/disabled properly.
  3. **Impact is limited to functionality**: The commit message and code changes show this is purely a state management issue. When re-enabling the TMC fails, the driver leaves `drvdata->reading = true`, which blocks future operations with -EBUSY errors. The fix ensures the reading flag is always cleared regardless of the enable operation's success.
  4. **No memory corruption or privilege escalation**: The code changes show the fix simply moves `drvdata->reading = false` to always execute, even if `__tmc_etb_enable_hw()` fails. This prevents the driver from getting stuck in a "reading" state but doesn't fix any memory safety issues or access control problems.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix state management issues, unbalanced operations, or hardware readiness checks (like commits 2 and 3 in the examples) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", while only the global-out-of-bounds access (commit 1) received a CVE.
  The fix is important for proper driver functionality but does not represent a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
499a8cee81258 iio: adc: ad4851: fix ad4858 chan pointer handling
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the vulnerability in detail. Based on the code analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a memory corruption vulnerability. Here's the specific issue:
  1. **Out-of-bounds pointer access**: In the original `ad4858_parse_channels()` function, the pointer `ad4851_channels` is incremented in line 1053 (`ad4851_channels++`) within the `device_for_each_child_node_scoped()` loop.
  2. **Double pointer increment problem**: The `ad4851_parse_channels_common()` function already increments the pointer internally (line 1006) as it populates each channel. When `ad4858_parse_channels()` receives the returned pointer, it points to **past the end** of the allocated array.
  3. **Memory corruption**: When the code then accesses `ad4851_channels->has_ext_scan_type` (line 1045) and other fields in the loop, it's writing to memory beyond the allocated buffer. This causes:
     - Buffer overflow when writing to unallocated memory
     - Potential corruption of adjacent memory structures
     - When `indio_dev->channels` is set to this invalid pointer (line 1056), any subsequent access through this pointer would be out-of-bounds
  4. **Security impact**: This vulnerability could lead to:
     - System crashes/denial of service
     - Memory corruption that could potentially be exploited
     - Unpredictable behavior when the driver operates on corrupted channel data
  The fix correctly addresses this by using an index-based approach (`ad4851_channels[i]`) instead of pointer arithmetic, ensuring all accesses remain within the allocated array bounds.
  This matches the pattern of similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which also fixed out-of-bounds array accesses in IIO ADC drivers (e.g., the PAC1934 and ti-ads8688 fixes).
921fece3268c3 iio: dac: adi-axi-dac: fix bus read
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Functional fix, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a timing issue where the driver was not waiting for the hardware busy flag to clear before reading data. This caused "wrong reads" and "wrong DAC chip ID read at first boot" - these are functionality/reliability issues, not security vulnerabilities.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue manifests as incorrect data reads from the DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) hardware registers. This does not lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure of sensitive data
     - System crashes that could be exploited
     - Any other security-relevant consequences
  3. **Hardware interface bug**: This is a bug in the hardware interface implementation where the driver wasn't following the proper protocol (waiting for busy flag) when communicating with the DAC hardware via AXI bus.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The fix pattern is similar to the reference commits which also deal with hardware interface improvements and fixes (register bit fixes, timing improvements) - none of which were assigned CVEs.
  The commit simply adds a `regmap_read_poll_timeout()` call to wait for the `AXI_DAC_UI_STATUS_IF_BUSY` bit to clear before proceeding with the read operation, ensuring proper synchronization with the hardware.
6ebf1982038af fpga: fix potential null pointer deref in fpga_mgr_test_img_load_sgt()
- [sasha] Now let me compare this with the similar commits that were assigned CVEs:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Test Code Only**: The vulnerability exists exclusively in KUnit test code (`drivers/fpga/tests/fpga-mgr-test.c`), not in production kernel code. This test code only runs when KUnit tests are explicitly executed during development/testing.
  2. **No Security Impact**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed NULL pointer dereferences in core driver code like `drivers/base/module.c` or production test infrastructure), this fix is in an FPGA manager unit test that:
     - Is only compiled when `CONFIG_FPGA_KUNIT_TESTS` is enabled
     - Only runs during KUnit testing
     - Cannot be triggered during normal system operation
  3. **Limited Scope**: The code path can only be triggered when:
     - Running KUnit tests specifically for FPGA manager
     - Memory allocation fails during test execution
     - This would only crash the test harness, not the production system
  The similar commits that received CVEs (commits 1, 3, 4, and 5) all fixed NULL pointer dereferences in production code paths that could be triggered during normal system operation, potentially causing kernel panics or system instability. In contrast, this fix addresses a bug that can only manifest in a controlled test environment.
7351312632e83 counter: interrupt-cnt: Protect enable/disable OPs with mutex
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications. Looking at the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a race condition in the enable/disable operations of an interrupt counter driver that could lead to an inconsistent state (priv->enabled == false but IRQ left enabled). While this is a legitimate bug, it doesn't represent a security vulnerability.
  2. **Impact Analysis**:
     - The worst case is that the interrupt remains enabled when it should be disabled
     - This would cause the counter to continue counting interrupts when it shouldn't
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or system crash potential
     - No sensitive information disclosure
  3. **Attack Surface**: 
     - This driver is used for measuring interrupt frequency (e.g., rotation speed of agricultural equipment)
     - The race condition requires specific timing between two CPUs accessing the enable/disable interface
     - It's a functional correctness issue rather than a security issue
  4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE Status: YES) involved enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt-disabled section, which could affect system-wide interrupt handling
     - This commit only affects the local state of a counter device driver
  5. **Security Relevance**:
     - No security boundaries are crossed
     - No system stability impact beyond incorrect counter readings
     - No potential for exploitation to gain unauthorized access or cause denial of service
  The fix adds mutex protection to prevent the race condition, which is good practice for concurrent access, but the original bug doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
f6028eeeb5e4c coresight: core: Disable helpers for devices that fail to enable
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional research on the coresight subsystem, let me provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: While the bug does leave helper devices enabled after a failure, the actual security implications are minimal:
     - CoreSight is a hardware tracing/debugging infrastructure that requires privileged access (typically root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
     - The helper devices (like CATU) are support components that don't directly handle sensitive data
     - The bug is a resource cleanup issue rather than a security vulnerability
  2. **No Direct Exploitability**: 
     - This is purely a resource management bug where helper devices aren't properly disabled on error paths
     - There's no evidence this can be exploited to gain privileges, leak information, or cause system instability
     - The commit message and code changes show this is about proper cleanup, not fixing a security hole
  3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the other coresight cleanup/fix commits were assigned CVEs except for one memory leak (commit 5)
     - The CVE-assigned commit (cscfg_create_device memleak) was a direct memory leak that could be triggered repeatedly
     - This commit is more similar to the non-CVE commits that fix functional issues without security implications
  4. **Nature of the Fix**:
     - The fix simply adds `coresight_disable_helpers()` calls in error paths
     - This is defensive programming to ensure proper cleanup, not patching a vulnerability
     - The impact is limited to leaving some helper devices in an enabled state, which doesn't pose a security risk
  The bug is a legitimate functional issue that should be fixed, but it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it lacks meaningful security implications or exploitability.
a03a0a08c6fe5 coresight: catu: Introduce refcount and spinlock for enabling/disabling
- [sasha] Now let me look at the actual code changes in the commit to understand the race condition better. The commit shows:
  1. Adding a spinlock (`raw_spinlock_t spinlock`) to the `catu_drvdata` structure
  2. Using reference counting (`csdev->refcnt`) to track enable/disable state
  3. Protecting enable/disable operations with `guard(raw_spinlock_irqsave)`
  The key issue is in the enable/disable functions where multiple CPUs can simultaneously access the CATU device. Looking at the original code:
  ```c
  static int catu_enable(struct coresight_device *csdev, enum cs_mode mode,
  		       void *data)
  {
  	int rc;
  	struct catu_drvdata *catu_drvdata = csdev_to_catu_drvdata(csdev);
  	CS_UNLOCK(catu_drvdata->base);
  	rc = catu_enable_hw(catu_drvdata, mode, data);
  	CS_LOCK(catu_drvdata->base);
  	return rc;
  }
  ```
  Without synchronization, if multiple CPUs call this simultaneously, they could:
  1. Both check that the device is not enabled
  2. Both try to enable it, causing the second one to fail with -EBUSY
  3. Or worse, cause inconsistent hardware state
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit fixes a race condition in the CATU device enable/disable operations when multiple CPUs access it concurrently via the perf interface. While this is a legitimate bug fix for a race condition, it does not qualify for a CVE because:
  1. **No security boundary crossing**: The race condition occurs within kernel space between CPUs accessing debugging/tracing hardware. This doesn't allow unprivileged users to gain elevated privileges or access restricted data.
  2. **Limited impact**: The race condition can cause:
     - Device enable/disable operations to fail with -EBUSY
     - Potential inconsistent hardware state in the tracing unit
     - But no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  3. **Debugging/tracing context**: The CATU (CoreSight Address Translation Unit) is part of ARM's debug and trace infrastructure, typically used for system debugging and performance analysis, not a security-critical component.
  4. **No exploitation vector**: The commit message describes this as occurring "when tracing ETM data on multiple CPUs concurrently via the perf interface" - this is a normal operational scenario, not an attack vector.
  This is a reliability/correctness fix for proper synchronization in a debug component, not a security vulnerability fix.
9f52aecc952dd coresight: Fixes device's owner field for registered using coresight_init_driver()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a security vulnerability where:
  1. **Module reference counting bug**: The `coresight_init_driver()` function uses macros `amba_driver_register()` and `platform_driver_register()` which both use `THIS_MODULE`. When called from a sub-module (like tmc/stm/funnel), these macros incorrectly capture the coresight-core module's reference instead of the actual sub-module's reference.
  2. **Use-after-free vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states "The sub coresight modules can be removed while their callbacks are running, resulting in a general protection failure." This is a classic use-after-free scenario where:
     - A sub-module (e.g., coresight-tmc) registers callbacks via coresight-core
     - The kernel incorrectly tracks the module ownership as coresight-core instead of coresight-tmc
     - The sub-module can be unloaded while its callbacks are still executing
     - This leads to the kernel executing code that has been freed, causing a general protection fault
  3. **Exploitable condition**: This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by:
     - Loading a coresight sub-module
     - Triggering operations that use the module's callbacks
     - Unloading the module while callbacks are executing
     - Causing kernel crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution
  4. **Fix validates the security issue**: The fix adds a `struct module *owner` parameter to properly track module ownership, preventing premature module unloading.
  This is similar to the CVE-assigned commit in the examples (igb driver's invalid memory access) - both involve incorrect module reference handling leading to memory safety issues.
6d223b8ffcd15 MIPS: Loongson64: Add missing '#interrupt-cells' for loongson64c_ls7a
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change adds a missing `#interrupt-cells = <1>` property to the MSI controller device tree node to fix a dtc (device tree compiler) warning. This is purely a device tree syntactic fix that:
  1. **Does not fix a security vulnerability** - It fixes a compilation warning about missing device tree properties
  2. **Has no security impact** - The MSI controller is used as an `msi-parent` (not `interrupt-parent`), and the missing property only caused a harmless dtc warning
  3. **No functional change** - The MSI controller driver doesn't use or require the `#interrupt-cells` property for its operation, as evidenced by the driver code
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits** - The referenced similar commits (98a9e2ac3755 and d89a415ff8d5) that fixed identical warnings were also marked as "CVE Status: NO"
  5. **Documentation issue** - The device tree binding documentation for this controller doesn't even list `interrupt-controller` or `#interrupt-cells` as required properties
  The warning was triggered because the node had `interrupt-controller` property but was missing the corresponding `#interrupt-cells` property, which is a device tree specification requirement for completeness, not a security issue.
73fb0ec9436ae usb: acpi: Prevent null pointer dereference in usb_acpi_add_usb4_devlink()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer.
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's the explanation based on the code changes:
  1. **Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a clear null pointer dereference where `usb_hub_to_struct_hub()` can return NULL, but the code immediately dereferences it with `hub->ports[udev->portnum - 1]` without checking.
  2. **Security Impact**: This is a kernel null pointer dereference that can cause a system crash (DoS). The vulnerability occurs in the USB subsystem's ACPI companion lookup path, which is triggered during USB device enumeration.
  3. **Exploitability**: The vulnerability can be triggered during USB device operations, particularly:
     - When a USB3 device is tunneled through USB4/Thunderbolt
     - During hub driver unbind or teardown race conditions
     - When hub's actconfig or maxchild is 0
  4. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The commit message explicitly references commit 12783c0b9e2c which fixed a nearly identical issue in `update_port_device_state()`. Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 fixed the same pattern and was assigned a CVE
     - Similar Commits 2 and 3 fixed identical patterns in port.c and were assigned CVEs
     - Similar Commit 4 fixed a null pointer dereference in ACPI code and was assigned a CVE
  5. **Code Pattern Consistency**: The fix adds a NULL check after `usb_hub_to_struct_hub()`, which is the established pattern throughout the codebase. The original code violated this pattern by not checking for NULL.
  The vulnerability allows a local attacker or malicious USB device to cause a kernel crash through a null pointer dereference, making it a denial of service vulnerability worthy of CVE assignment.
8712e4986e7ce iio: adc: ad7124: Fix 3dB filter frequency reading
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that corrects incorrect filter coefficient values (0.23 vs 0.272 for sinc3, and 0.262 vs 0.230 for sinc4) used in calculating the 3dB filter frequency. The fix simply swaps/corrects these coefficients according to the datasheet specifications.
  2. **No Exploitable Condition**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (which fixed division by zero vulnerabilities that could cause kernel crashes), this commit only affects the accuracy of filter frequency calculations. There's no crash, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant impact.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The bug results in incorrect frequency readings/settings for the low-pass filter, which is a functionality issue rather than a security issue. Users would get incorrect filter behavior but no system compromise.
  4. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to leverage this incorrect calculation to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or violate any security properties of the system.
  The commit is purely a correctness fix for filter coefficients that were incorrectly implemented, making it a regular bug fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
9016776f13016 iio: filter: admv8818: Support frequencies >= 2^32
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that adds support for frequencies >= 2^32 Hz. The issue is that without the `write_raw_get_fmt` callback returning `IIO_VAL_INT_64`, the IIO framework would incorrectly handle frequency values above ~4.29 GHz when writing to the device.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes are:
     - Adding a `write_raw_get_fmt` function that tells the IIO framework to expect 64-bit values
     - Adding a negative frequency check (`if ((s64)freq < 0) return -EINVAL;`)
     
     Neither of these changes fix a security vulnerability. The negative frequency check is just input validation to prevent nonsensical values.
  3. **No memory safety issues**: There's no buffer overflow, out-of-bounds access, or other memory safety issue being fixed. The code simply wasn't properly declaring the data format for frequencies above 2^32.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix documentation, add missing Kconfig dependencies, or format issues are marked as "NO CVE". This commit falls into a similar category of functional fixes rather than security fixes.
  5. **The actual impact**: Without this fix, users trying to set filter frequencies above ~4.29 GHz would experience incorrect behavior due to integer truncation, but this would not lead to any security compromise of the system.
d542db7095d32 iio: filter: admv8818: fix range calculation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a calculation issue in the ADMV8818 filter driver that resulted in "suboptimal clock rates" and incorrect filter corner frequency calculations. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Hardware filter control**: The ADMV8818 is a hardware high-pass and low-pass filter device (2-18 GHz range) used in RF/microwave applications. The bug affects the calculation of filter corner frequencies, which would result in the filter not operating at the exact intended frequency - this is a performance/accuracy issue.
  3. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - Old algorithm had incorrect frequency range calculations
     - New algorithm properly searches for minimum error while ensuring HPF corner is lower than target and LPF corner is higher than target
     - Added support for margin properties via device tree
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure risks
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the other commits shown as examples (e.g., "iio: adc: ad7192: fix channel select", "clk: analogbits: Fix incorrect calculation of vco rate delta") which were also calculation/configuration fixes without security implications.
  The commit improves the accuracy of filter frequency selection in an RF filter driver, which is a quality/functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
fb6009a28d77e iio: filter: admv8818: fix integer overflow
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: While this is an integer overflow bug on 32-bit systems, it only affects the configuration of a hardware filter's frequency band selection. The bug causes incorrect filter band selection for certain frequencies (around 3.4-3.9 GHz would incorrectly use band 3 settings instead of band 1-2).
  2. **Hardware-Specific Driver**: This is a driver for the ADMV8818 RF filter chip, which is specialized hardware used in RF/microwave applications. The incorrect filter configuration would result in suboptimal RF performance but not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No Memory Corruption or Privilege Escalation**: The overflow doesn't lead to memory corruption, out-of-bounds access, or privilege escalation. The values `hpf_band` and `hpf_step` are bounded (hpf_band is written to a 3-bit field, hpf_step to a 4-bit field via FIELD_PREP macros).
  4. **Functional Bug, Not Security Bug**: This is a functional correctness issue where the filter might be misconfigured for certain frequency ranges on 32-bit systems. It would cause the RF filter to use wrong settings, affecting signal quality but not system security.
  Unlike the similar commits with CVE status YES (which involved buffer overflows with potential memory corruption), this overflow only affects a numerical comparison that determines hardware configuration settings.
ef0ce24f590ac iio: filter: admv8818: fix band 4, state 15
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination about whether this commit requires a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The change corrects the upper frequency range limit for LPF (Low-Pass Filter) Band 4 from 18.5 GHz to 18.85 GHz. This is a datasheet specification correction, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The ADMV8818 is a digitally tunable high-pass and low-pass filter device for microwave frequencies (2-18 GHz)
     - The incorrect range (18.5 GHz instead of 18.85 GHz) would only affect frequency selection accuracy for the highest band
     - This is a functional correctness issue, not a security issue
  3. **No security implications**:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - No privilege escalation possibilities
     - No access control bypass
     - No information disclosure
     - Simply an incorrect hardware specification that affects filter tuning accuracy
  4. **Code behavior**: Looking at the `__admv8818_lpf_select` function, the frequency ranges are used to:
     - Select the appropriate filter band (1-4)
     - Calculate filter steps within that band
     - The incorrect upper limit would only cause slightly inaccurate filter configuration for frequencies between 18.5-18.85 GHz
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: This is similar to the reference commits shown which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they fix Kconfig formatting, documentation, and missing driver dependencies, all non-security issues.
  This is a simple specification correction to match the hardware datasheet, with no security implications whatsoever.
1a760d10ded37 thunderbolt: Fix a logic error in wake on connect
- [sasha] So device_may_wakeup() checks if the device has wakeup capability enabled via the power management subsystem (typically controlled via sysfs).
  **CVE Analysis Decision: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a logic error that causes incorrect behavior in the wake-on-connect/disconnect feature, but it does not introduce any security vulnerability. The bug causes the system to wake up more often than intended (when it shouldn't), but this doesn't create any security risk.
  2. **Feature Correctness Issue**: The issue is that the wake functionality was working even when the user had explicitly disabled it via sysfs (defaulting to disabled). This is a functionality bug where the system doesn't respect user preferences, but not a security issue.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Information Disclosure**: The bug doesn't allow unprivileged users to gain elevated access, doesn't expose sensitive information, and doesn't allow any form of system compromise.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they involve:
     - Wake configuration fixes (Similar Commit 1)
     - USB suspend/resume clock fixes (Similar Commits 2, 5)
     - Port reset functionality (Similar Commit 3)
     - Wake notification fixes (Similar Commit 4)
     
     None of these were assigned CVEs because they are functionality/correctness fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Impact Limited to Power Management**: The worst-case scenario is that the system wakes up from sleep when it shouldn't, which is an annoyance but not a security concern.
  The commit simply fixes a logic error where OR was used instead of AND, ensuring that both the wake flag must be set AND the user must have enabled wakeup via sysfs for the wake functionality to work as originally intended.
86bcae88c9209 serial: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in mlb_usio_probe()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and the similar commits provided, here's my conclusion:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a clear NULL pointer dereference vulnerability where `devm_ioremap()` can return NULL on error (e.g., out of memory conditions), but the original code doesn't check for this before using `port->membase`.
  2. **Exploitable Path**: After `port->membase` is assigned (potentially NULL), the code continues to:
     - Set up various port parameters
     - Call `uart_add_one_port()` which registers the port with the serial core
     
     During or after `uart_add_one_port()`, various uart operations could be triggered that dereference `port->membase`, such as:
     - `mlb_usio_tx_empty()` - directly reads from `port->membase + MLB_USIO_REG_SSR`
     - `mlb_usio_startup()` - reads/writes to multiple registers via `port->membase`
     - Console operations if configured
  3. **Similar CVE Precedent**: All the similar commits shown were assigned CVEs:
     - "ata: pata_pxa: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference" - CVE assigned
     - "iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference" - CVE assigned
     - "serial: liteuart: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ->remove()" - CVE assigned
     - "serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: Fix potential NULL dereference" - CVE assigned
  4. **Security Impact**: This could lead to:
     - Kernel crash/DoS when memory allocation fails
     - Potential for controlled exploitation if an attacker can influence memory allocation failures
     - System instability in resource-constrained environments
  5. **Pattern Match**: The fix pattern exactly matches other CVE-assigned commits - adding a NULL check after `devm_ioremap()` and returning `-ENOMEM` on failure.
  The vulnerability is in a probe function of a serial driver, making it triggerable during device initialization, which could be exploited through various means including hot-plugging devices or during system boot with specific configurations.
ffb34a60ce866 usb: renesas_usbhs: Reorder clock handling and power management in probe
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a critical crash vulnerability (synchronous external abort) that occurs when accessing hardware registers before enabling clocks. This is a denial-of-service vulnerability that can crash the system.
  2. **Root Cause**: The problematic code flow shows:
     ```
     usbhs_probe()
         usbhs_sys_clock_ctrl()
             usbhs_bset()
                 usbhs_write()
                     iowrite16()  <-- Register access before enabling clocks
     ```
     This causes a kernel panic with "Internal error: synchronous external abort: 0000000096000010"
  3. **Impact**: The vulnerability causes a system crash during driver probe on affected hardware (RZ/V2H SoC), making the USB functionality unusable and potentially causing system instability.
  4. **Fix Pattern**: The fix reorders initialization to enable PM runtime and clocks before any register access:
     - Moves `pm_runtime_enable()` and clock acquisition earlier in probe
     - Ensures clocks are enabled before any register operations
     - Properly manages PM state throughout initialization
  5. **Similar CVE Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 3 and 4 with "Flush the notify_hotplug_work" were assigned CVEs for fixing NULL pointer dereference crashes
     - This commit fixes a similar crash vulnerability (synchronous external abort)
  6. **Exploitability**: While this appears to trigger during normal driver loading rather than requiring special conditions, it still represents a denial-of-service vulnerability that crashes the kernel.
  The commit clearly fixes a security vulnerability that causes kernel crashes due to improper initialization ordering, which aligns with the pattern of other CVE-assigned commits in this driver.
9960be72a54cf sched_ext: idle: Skip cross-node search with !CONFIG_NUMA
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes from the commit message directly. Based on the diff provided, I can see:
  1. The commit adds `#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA` around the `pick_idle_cpu_from_online_nodes()` function
  2. It provides a stub implementation that returns `-EBUSY` when `CONFIG_NUMA` is not defined
  3. This prevents cross-node searches when NUMA is disabled
  Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit is a compile-time optimization/simplification for systems built without CONFIG_NUMA. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability - it simply avoids unnecessary complexity when NUMA support is disabled.
  2. **Performance/Logic Optimization**: The change is purely about avoiding cross-node searches in non-NUMA configurations where the concept of nodes doesn't exist. This is a logical improvement rather than a security fix.
  3. **No Attack Vector**: The original code wasn't exploitable. Without CONFIG_NUMA, the cross-node search logic would likely be a no-op or return quickly anyway. This change just makes that explicit at compile time.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1, 2, and 5 all deal with NUMA-related optimizations and none were assigned CVEs
     - Only commit 4 (SGX deadlock fix) received a CVE because it fixed an actual deadlock that could be triggered
  5. **Build Configuration Change**: The fix is achieved through conditional compilation (`#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA`), which is a build-time configuration change rather than a runtime security fix.
  The commit is a cleanup/optimization that prevents unnecessary code execution in non-NUMA builds, but it doesn't address any security vulnerability, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issues.
793908d60b874 PCI: endpoint: Retain fixed-size BAR size as well as aligned size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit fixes a functional bug where the aligned size (potentially larger than the fixed BAR size) was incorrectly stored in `epf_bar[bar].size` instead of the actual fixed BAR size. This caused `pci_epc_set_bar()` to fail because it validates that the size matches the fixed BAR size (line 610 in pci-epc-core.c).
  2. **No memory corruption or security impact**: The issue is purely functional - it prevents proper BAR configuration but doesn't lead to:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory leaks (the allocation/deallocation still worked correctly)
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  3. **The bug causes denial of functionality, not exploitation**: When the bug occurs, `pci_epc_set_bar()` simply returns -EINVAL due to the size mismatch check. This prevents the BAR from being configured correctly but doesn't create any exploitable condition.
  4. **Safe failure mode**: The validation check at line 610 (`epc_features->bar[bar].fixed_size != epf_bar->size`) actually prevents any potential misuse - it fails safely rather than allowing incorrect configuration.
  The commit is a correctness fix that separates the fixed BAR size (stored in `.size`) from the aligned allocation size (stored in new `.aligned_size`), ensuring that `dma_free_coherent()` uses the correct allocation size while `pci_epc_set_bar()` sees the correct BAR size.
1dbaf8b1bafb8 rust: pci: fix docs related to missing Markdown code spans
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Documentation-only changes**: All changes in this commit are purely documentation improvements:
     - Adding missing Markdown code spans around code references
     - Improving the title for `DeviceId` struct documentation
     - Converting a TODO from documentation comment to a normal comment
     - Adding a link to the C struct documentation
  2. **No functional code changes**: The commit only modifies comments and documentation strings. No actual executable code is changed:
     - Line 120: Changed comment from `/// Abstraction for bindings::pci_device_id.` to include proper markdown link
     - Line 178: Changed `/// IdTable type for PCI` to `/// \`IdTable\` type for PCI.` (adding code spans)
     - Lines 229-234: Converted TODO from doc comment (`///`) to normal comment (`//`)
  3. **No security impact**: Documentation changes cannot introduce security vulnerabilities. They don't affect:
     - Memory management
     - Access control
     - Input validation
     - Any runtime behavior
  4. **Similar to historical non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the historical commits shown with "CVE Status: NO" that were formatting/documentation fixes:
     - "xhci: pci: Fix indentation in the PCI device ID definitions" - formatting only
     - "drm/panic: fix overindented list items in documentation" - documentation formatting
     - "rust: block: fix formatting in GenDisk doc" - documentation formatting
  The commit is purely cosmetic, improving code documentation readability without any functional or security implications.
5af9f1fa57687 rtc: loongson: Add missing alarm notifications for ACPI RTC events
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The problem is that RTC alarm notifications fail to reach userspace applications that are waiting via `select()` or `poll()`. This is a functionality issue where alarms don't properly notify waiting processes.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The missing `rtc_update_irq()` call in the ACPI handler simply means that applications won't receive alarm notifications. This doesn't allow:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - System compromise
     - Denial of service (beyond the specific functionality not working)
  3. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed interrupt clearing issue that caused multiple triggers
     - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): Fixed incorrect interrupt line configuration
     - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Fixed alarm offset calculation issue
     - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Added RTC support to device tree
  4. **Code Analysis**: The changes show:
     - Adding `rtc_update_irq()` to notify userspace of alarm events
     - Moving `TOY_MATCH0_REG` clearing to fix multiple interrupt triggers
     - These are functional fixes to ensure proper alarm behavior
  5. **Unlike CVE-worthy Commit**: Similar Commit 2 (YES CVE) fixed a null pointer dereference that could crash the system - a clear security issue. This commit has no such system stability or security implications.
  The commit simply ensures that RTC alarms work correctly by properly notifying userspace applications - a functional fix rather than a security fix.
8b926f237743f PCI/pwrctrl: Cancel outstanding rescan work when unregistering
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in the PCI power control (pwrctrl) subsystem. Here's why this warrants a CVE:
  1. **Security Impact - Use-After-Free**: The commit explicitly mentions "It's possible to trigger use-after-free here" which is a classic memory safety vulnerability that can potentially lead to:
     - Kernel crashes/DoS
     - Information disclosure
     - Potential privilege escalation
  2. **Race Condition Vulnerability**: The issue involves a race between:
     - The `rescan_work_func()` running on a workqueue (lines 41-49 in core.c)
     - Module unloading that frees the `pwrctrl` structure
  3. **Exploitable Scenario**: The commit describes a realistic attack scenario:
     - Force `rescan_work_func()` to take a long time (e.g., by manipulating PCI bus conditions)
     - Unload a pwrctrl driver module while the work is still pending/executing
     - The work function will then access freed memory when it tries to use `pwrctrl->dev`
  4. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the fix:
     ```c
     +	cancel_work_sync(&pwrctrl->work);
     ```
     This ensures the scheduled work completes before the data structures are freed, preventing the use-after-free.
  5. **Similar CVE Patterns**: This matches patterns in similar commits marked as CVE-worthy:
     - Similar Commit 3 (mhi_pci_remove) - CVE assigned for timer-based use-after-free
     - Similar Commit 5 (mpc52xx_spi_remove) - CVE assigned for work-based use-after-free
  The vulnerability allows local attackers with ability to load/unload kernel modules to potentially crash the system or exploit the use-after-free for further attacks.
a0b62cc310239 PCI/DPC: Log Error Source ID only when valid
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a logging/diagnostic improvement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit changes how DPC (Downstream Port Containment) error information is logged to dmesg.
  2. **No security impact**: The key change is that the code now only reads and logs the DPC Source ID (indicating which device triggered the error) when it's actually valid according to the PCIe specification - specifically only when DPC was triggered by ERR_NONFATAL or ERR_FATAL messages.
  3. **Previous behavior**: Before this patch, the code was always reading the DPC_SOURCE_ID register at line 264, even when the PCIe spec says it's undefined/invalid for certain trigger reasons. This could lead to logging misleading information, but not a security issue.
  4. **Specification compliance**: The commit message explicitly states "DPC Error Source ID is only valid when the DPC Trigger Reason indicates that DPC was triggered due to reception of an ERR_NONFATAL or ERR_FATAL Message (PCIe r6.0, sec 7.9.14.5)." This is fixing a spec compliance issue in logging.
  5. **Code changes**: The actual changes show:
     - Restructuring the logging to use a switch statement
     - Only reading PCI_EXP_DPC_SOURCE_ID when reason is PCI_EXP_DPC_STATUS_TRIGGER_RSN_NFE or PCI_EXP_DPC_STATUS_TRIGGER_RSN_FE
     - Improving log message clarity
  6. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: There's no security boundary being crossed, no information disclosure to unprivileged users, and no potential for exploitation.
  This is similar to the "Similar Commit 1" example which also dealt with PCI error response definitions and was marked as "CVE Status: NO".
a424b598e6a6c PCI/DPC: Initialize aer_err_info before using it
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me provide my analysis:
  **CVE Status: YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability involving uninitialized memory usage that can lead to:
  1. **Out-of-bounds array access**: The uninitialized `info->severity` field is used as an index into the `aer_error_severity_string[]` array at lines 707, 717, and other places. Since severity is a 2-bit field in the struct but contains garbage, it can have values 0-3, while the array only has 3 elements (indices 0-2). This causes an out-of-bounds read when severity=3.
  2. **Kernel information disclosure**: The `aer_print_error()` function prints multiple fields from the uninitialized struct:
     - `info->status` and `info->mask` (line 721)
     - `info->tlp` header data if `tlp_header_valid` is non-zero (line 726)
     - These fields contain random kernel stack data that gets logged/printed
  3. **Unpredictable error handling**: The code at line 223 checks `if (info->severity == AER_CORRECTABLE)` with uninitialized data, potentially taking wrong code paths based on random stack contents.
  The commit message "PCI/DPC: Initialize aer_err_info before using it" and the fix (`struct aer_err_info info = {}`) clearly demonstrate this is fixing a security-relevant uninitialized memory usage bug that can leak kernel memory and cause out-of-bounds accesses.
631b2af2f3573 PCI/ACPI: Fix allocated memory release on error in pci_acpi_scan_root()
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the issue. When acpi_pci_root_create succeeds:
  1. It sets up a release callback that will eventually call info->ops->release_info(info)
  2. In our case, this is pci_acpi_generic_release_info which frees ri->cfg, ci->ops (which is root_ops), and ri
  But when acpi_pci_root_create fails and returns NULL, these allocations (ri, root_ops, and ri->cfg) are never freed, causing a memory leak.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a memory leak that occurs when `acpi_pci_root_create()` fails in `pci_acpi_scan_root()`. While this is indeed a resource leak, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The memory leak only occurs during PCI root bridge initialization failure, which is typically a boot-time operation. The leaked memory (ri, root_ops, and ri->cfg structures) cannot be exploited by an attacker to gain privileges, execute code, or cause system instability beyond the failed initialization itself.
  2. **Limited Scope**: This only happens when PCI root bridge creation fails, which is an error path during system initialization. It's not a condition that can be repeatedly triggered by an unprivileged user.
  3. **No Exploitability**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (which fixed issues in runtime-accessible paths like ACPI processor power management that could be triggered during normal operation), this leak occurs only in the error path of boot-time PCI initialization.
  The commit correctly fixes the leak by adding proper cleanup labels (free_cfg, free_root_ops, free_ri) to ensure all allocated memory is freed when `acpi_pci_root_create()` fails, but this is a code quality fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
fd447415e74bc dmaengine: ti: Add NULL check in udma_probe()
- [sasha] So the request_irq calls are in udma_alloc_chan_resources, which is NOT called during probe but is set as a callback that gets called later when channels are actually allocated for use.
  Based on this analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. The code allocates channel names using `devm_kasprintf()` at line 5625 but doesn't check if the allocation succeeded. The unchecked `uc->name` pointer is later dereferenced in multiple places:
  1. In `dma_pool_create(uc->name, ...)` calls (lines 2205, 2488, 2677)
  2. In `request_irq(..., uc->name, uc)` calls (lines 2335, 2353, 2524, 2542, 2709)
  These dereferences occur in `udma_alloc_chan_resources()` and similar functions that are called when DMA channels are actually allocated for use (not during probe). If `devm_kasprintf()` fails due to memory pressure and returns NULL, accessing `uc->name` in these functions will cause a kernel NULL pointer dereference, potentially leading to a denial of service.
  The fix properly adds a NULL check after the allocation, preventing this vulnerability. This matches the pattern of the similar commits provided that were assigned CVEs - they all fix missing NULL checks after `devm_kasprintf()` calls that could lead to NULL pointer dereferences.
62ada17a6217a soundwire: only compute port params in specific stream states
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the commit and code context I have:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a logic error in bandwidth calculation for SoundWire audio streams. The code was incorrectly including streams in ALLOCATED or DEPREPARED states when computing port parameters, leading to incorrect bandwidth calculations.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The fix adds a state check to exclude streams that are not in CONFIGURED, PREPARED, ENABLED, or DISABLED states
     - This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability
     - Incorrect bandwidth calculation could lead to audio quality issues or stream setup failures, but not security issues
  3. **No security boundaries crossed**: 
     - The code operates entirely within the kernel's audio subsystem
     - There's no privilege escalation potential
     - No memory corruption or overflow issues
     - No information disclosure
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (commits 1-5) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" and dealt with:
     - Bandwidth calculation fixes
     - Port mapping corrections  
     - Stream state handling
     - Audio configuration issues
  5. **Code changes**: The fix simply adds a state check:
     ```c
     if (m_rt->stream->state > SDW_STREAM_DISABLED ||
         m_rt->stream->state < SDW_STREAM_CONFIGURED)
         continue;
     ```
     This prevents incorrect inclusion of streams in bandwidth calculations but doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
  This is a quality/correctness fix for the SoundWire audio subsystem, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
25c36b54eafc9 phy: qcom-qusb2: reuse the IPQ6018 settings for IPQ5424
- [sasha] Now I can analyze the differences. The key differences between IPQ5424 and IPQ6018 init tables are:
  - QUSB2PHY_PORT_TUNE1: 0x00 (IPQ5424) vs 0xF8 (IPQ6018)
  - QUSB2PHY_PORT_TUNE2: 0x53 (IPQ5424) vs 0xB3 (IPQ6018)
  - QUSB2PHY_PORT_TUNE3: Not present in IPQ5424 vs 0x83 (IPQ6018)
  - QUSB2PHY_PORT_TUNE4: 0xc3 (IPQ5424) vs 0xC0 (IPQ6018)
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a hardware configuration change for USB PHY tuning parameters. The commit is fixing compliance test failures (specifically eye-diagram tests for High-speed Signal Quality) by adjusting electrical signal parameters.
  2. **Hardware Tuning, Not Security**: The changes are to PHY (Physical Layer) tuning registers that control electrical characteristics like voltage swing, pre-emphasis, and signal quality. These are hardware-specific calibration values that affect USB signal integrity, not security boundaries.
  3. **Functional Fix**: The commit message clearly states this is to fix compliance test failures - it's improving the electrical characteristics to meet USB specification requirements. The original values caused the hardware to fail USB compliance testing.
  4. **No Exploitable Condition**: There's no indication that the incorrect tuning values could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security impact. They simply caused the USB interface to not meet electrical specifications.
  5. **Similar Pattern to Other Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve PHY tuning adjustments for various Qualcomm hardware, and none were assigned CVEs because they're hardware calibration changes, not security fixes.
  The commit is simply reverting to known-good tuning values from IPQ6018 to fix USB compliance issues on IPQ5424 hardware.
8a040e13afd94 Revert "phy: qcom-qusb2: add QUSB2 support for IPQ5424"
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a revert that fixes incorrect PHY initialization settings that caused USB compliance test failures, specifically eye diagram tests. The changes affect signal quality parameters like:
     - HSTX_TRIM (transmitter current trimming) 
     - HSDISC_TRIM (disconnect threshold)
     - Pre-emphasis settings
     - Other electrical characteristics
  2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: While incorrect PHY settings can theoretically create conditions that might be exploited (poor signal integrity, unreliable detection), this commit is addressing:
     - Compliance test failures
     - Signal quality issues
     - Functional correctness per Hardware Design Document
  3. **Similar commits analysis**: All the provided similar commits (CVE Status: NO) follow the same pattern - they update PHY initialization sequences for proper hardware functionality, not to fix security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Impact assessment**: The commit message explicitly states the issue is "compliance tests especially eye diagram tests are failing" - this is a quality/standards compliance issue, not a security vulnerability fix.
  5. **Code changes**: The diff shows removal of ipq5424_init_tbl and ipq5424_phy_cfg structures, effectively making IPQ5424 fall back to using IPQ6018 settings. This is a configuration change for proper hardware operation, not a security patch.
  While poor PHY settings could theoretically be exploited in sophisticated attacks, this commit is fundamentally fixing a functional/compliance issue discovered through standard USB testing, not addressing an actual security vulnerability that was being exploited or could realistically be exploited in practice.
d14402a38c2d8 phy: qcom-qmp-usb: Fix an NULL vs IS_ERR() bug
- [sasha] Based on this analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  While this is a bug fix that addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The bug only occurs during the probe initialization phase when `devm_ioremap()` fails to map memory. This typically happens due to resource constraints or configuration issues, not from external input that could be controlled by an attacker.
  2. **No Security Boundary Crossing**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" that fix NULL pointer dereferences in runtime PM callbacks (which can be triggered during normal operation), this bug is confined to the driver probe/initialization phase.
  3. **Error Path Issue**: The code path where this NULL could cause problems (line 2159: `qmp->pcs_usb = qmp->pcs + cfg->pcs_usb_offset`) would only execute if the IS_ERR() check on line 2155 passes. Since NULL is not an error pointer, it would pass through and cause arithmetic on a NULL pointer.
  4. **Initialization-Time Only**: This issue can only occur during driver probe, not during normal runtime operation. An attacker would need the ability to cause driver probing with specific memory allocation failures, which is not a realistic attack vector.
  The similar commits that received CVEs (phy: qcom: qmp-usb: fix NULL-deref on runtime suspend) were assigned CVEs because they fixed NULL pointer dereferences that could occur during runtime PM operations, which represents a more accessible attack surface and could potentially be triggered by unprivileged users through sysfs.
4d4c10f763d78 PCI: Explicitly put devices into D0 when initializing
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional issue where NVMe devices fail to resume from suspend due to missing ACPI _REG method calls. This is a power management/device initialization bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The code changes are in the PCI device initialization path (`pci_pm_init`) which runs during device probe with kernel privileges. There's no user-controlled input or privilege escalation potential.
  3. **No memory safety issues**: The changes simply reorder existing function calls - moving `pci_pm_power_up_and_verify_state()` to execute before the runtime PM setup calls. The function itself just calls `pci_power_up()` and `pci_update_current_state()` which are standard PCI power management operations.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (Asus B1400 D3cold disable) - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 2 (VMD D0 state fix) - NO CVE  
     - Similar Commit 4 (AMD Renoir D3 quirks) - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 5 (StorageD3Enable force) - NO CVE
     All these commits deal with power state management issues and none received CVEs.
  5. **Only functional impact**: The issue manifests as devices not resuming properly from suspend, which is a functionality/reliability issue rather than a security issue. There's no potential for data disclosure, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
  The only similar commit that received a CVE (Similar Commit 3) was for an actual memory leak that could lead to OOM conditions through malicious repetition - a clear security issue. This commit has no such security implications.
e4d66131caaf1 PCI: imx6: Save and restore the LUT setting during suspend/resume for i.MX95 SoC
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific changes and their implications:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This commit adds functionality to save and restore the Look Up Table (LUT) settings during suspend/resume operations for the i.MX95 SoC. The LUT maps PCIe Request IDs to Stream IDs for IOMMU/MSI operations.
  2. **Not a Security Vulnerability Fix**: While the LUT is security-relevant (it controls IOMMU mappings), this commit doesn't fix an existing security vulnerability. Instead, it:
     - Adds new save/restore functionality that was missing
     - Prevents functional issues after suspend/resume
     - Is more of a feature completion/bug fix rather than a security fix
  3. **Impact Analysis**:
     - Without this fix: LUT settings would be lost during suspend/resume, causing PCIe devices to malfunction after resume
     - This is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability
     - The system would fail to work correctly rather than expose a security risk
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - The two similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fix actual suspend/resume failures that cause system crashes and kernel panics
     - This commit prevents functional degradation but doesn't fix crashes or security exposures
     - Similar to commit 3 (CVE Status: NO) which fixed a functional issue with reset flags
  5. **Code Changes**:
     - Adds `struct imx_lut_data` to store LUT entries
     - Implements `imx_pcie_lut_save()` and `imx_pcie_lut_restore()` functions
     - Integrates these into existing suspend/resume flow
     - These are preventive measures, not fixes for exploitable conditions
  The commit improves system reliability and functionality but doesn't address any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
7334364f9de79 PCI: apple: Use gpiod_set_value_cansleep in probe flow
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Security Impact**: This commit fixes a kernel warning that can be triggered when using GPIO controllers that require sleeping contexts (e.g., I2C/SPI GPIO expanders). As shown in `drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c`, using `gpiod_set_value()` on a GPIO that `can_sleep` triggers a `WARN_ON()`.
  2. **Denial of Service Risk**: On systems configured with `panic_on_warn=1`, this warning would cause a kernel panic, resulting in a system crash. This is a denial of service vulnerability that can be triggered by hardware configuration.
  3. **Pattern Matches CVE-Assigned Commits**: All five similar commits provided as reference were assigned CVEs, and they all fix the exact same issue - replacing `gpiod_set_value()` with `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` to avoid kernel warnings when using sleeping GPIO controllers.
  4. **Code Changes**: The commit changes two instances in `apple_pcie_setup_port()`:
     - Line 565: `gpiod_set_value(reset, 1)` → `gpiod_set_value_cansleep(reset, 1)`
     - Line 575: `gpiod_set_value(reset, 0)` → `gpiod_set_value_cansleep(reset, 0)`
  5. **Affected Component**: The PCI subsystem is a critical kernel component, and the Apple PCIe controller driver handles fundamental hardware initialization. A crash during PCIe initialization would prevent the system from booting properly.
  This commit prevents potential kernel panics on systems using the Apple PCIe controller with GPIO expanders that require sleeping contexts, making it a security-relevant fix that warrants CVE assignment.
8805f32a96d3b PCI: cadence: Fix runtime atomic count underflow
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. The issue is:
  1. The caller (cdns_plat_pcie_probe) calls `pm_runtime_get_sync()` before calling `cdns_pcie_host_setup()`
  2. If `cdns_pcie_host_setup()` fails, it was incorrectly calling `pm_runtime_put_sync()` 
  3. The caller also calls `pm_runtime_put_sync()` in its error path
  4. This results in a double-decrement of the PM runtime counter
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Bug Type**: This is a runtime PM reference counting error that causes a warning ("runtime PM usage count underflow") but does not have security implications. It's a double-decrement issue in error handling paths.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The code changes show this is purely a cleanup/correctness fix. The bug:
     - Does not allow privilege escalation
     - Does not cause memory corruption
     - Does not expose sensitive information
     - Does not allow denial of service beyond a warning message
     - Only affects error paths when `pci_host_probe()` fails
  3. **Limited Scope**: The issue only manifests when:
     - The PCI host probe fails (error condition)
     - Results in an incorrect PM runtime reference count
     - Causes a warning but no actual security vulnerability
  4. **Pattern Recognition**: Looking at the provided similar commits, none of the PM-related fixes received CVEs. For example, the "PCI: starfive: Enable controller runtime PM before probing host bridge" commit (similar commit 3) also fixes PM ordering issues but has CVE Status: NO.
  5. **Code Change**: The fix simply removes the erroneous `pm_runtime_put_sync()` call, preventing the double-decrement. This is a straightforward correctness fix with no security implications.
b584ab12d59f6 PCI: rcar-gen4: set ep BAR4 fixed size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit adds a documentation/constraint declaration for BAR4 having a fixed size of 256 bytes. This is a hardware constraint documentation, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only adds metadata (`bar[BAR_4] = { .type = BAR_FIXED, .fixed_size = 256 }`) to properly document a hardware limitation. Without this, the system would still enforce constraints through other mechanisms (pci_epc_set_bar() checks).
  3. **Defensive programming**: This is a defensive programming measure to ensure proper validation of BAR sizes. The pci_epc_set_bar() function (as shown in similar commit 1) already validates that fixed BARs match their declared size, preventing misconfigurations.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no evidence that the missing constraint declaration could lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Any other security impact
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (commits 1-5) all deal with BAR size constraints and configurations, and none were assigned CVEs because they are configuration/correctness fixes rather than security fixes.
  The commit is a correctness fix that ensures the endpoint controller properly advertises its hardware limitations to prevent potential configuration errors, but it does not address any security vulnerability.
c7540e5423d7f PCI: rockchip: Fix order of rockchip_pci_core_rsts
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific commit and similar commits to determine if this warrants a CVE:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional regression but does not represent a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that PCIe link speed gets downgraded from 5 GT/s (Gen2) to 2.5 GT/s (Gen1) due to incorrect reset sequence ordering. This is a performance/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes only reorder the reset sequence to account for `reset_control_bulk_deassert()` deasserting in reverse order. There's no:
     - Memory corruption or overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service (system remains functional, just at lower performance)
  3. **Similar commits analysis**: All the similar commits shown (CVE Status: NO) are also non-security fixes:
     - Error code fixes (returning -ENOMEM instead of success)
     - GPIO initialization values
     - Vendor ID definitions
     - Function argument ordering
     - Device tree fixes
  4. **Limited scope**: The impact is confined to Rockchip PCIe controller functionality, specifically affecting link negotiation speed. The system continues to function correctly, just at a reduced performance level.
  5. **Root cause**: This is a typical integration issue when refactoring code to use bulk APIs - the developer didn't account for the reverse order behavior of `reset_control_bulk_deassert()`.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that restores proper PCIe link speed negotiation, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it lacks any security implications.
d24eba726aadf PCI: Print the actual delay time in pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit only fixes a debug print statement to display the actual delay value instead of a hardcoded "1000 msec". The change is purely cosmetic and has no security implications:
  ```diff
  - pci_info(dev, "Data Link Layer Link Active not set in 1000 msec\n");
  + pci_info(dev, "Data Link Layer Link Active not set in %d msec\n", delay);
  ```
  This is a trivial logging improvement that:
  - Does not fix any vulnerability
  - Does not change program behavior or control flow
  - Only corrects misleading debug information
  - Has no impact on system security, reliability, or functionality
  The commit simply makes the debug message more accurate by showing the actual delay value that was used, rather than always printing "1000 msec" regardless of the real delay.
2af781a9edc4e PCI: pciehp: Ignore Link Down/Up caused by Secondary Bus Reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional issue where PCIe bandwidth control shares an interrupt with PCIe hotplug, causing spurious device teardowns during Secondary Bus Reset. This is a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability. The commit message states:
     - "As a result, Joel reports VFIO passthrough failure of a GPU"
     - The issue causes incorrect device removal, not a security breach
  2. **Impact is Limited to Functionality**: The code changes show this is about preventing spurious link change events from being misinterpreted. The new functions added (`pci_hp_ignore_link_change()`, `pci_hp_unignore_link_change()`, `pci_hp_spurious_link_change()`) are designed to properly handle expected link state changes during operations like:
     - Secondary Bus Reset
     - Suspend to D3cold
     - Firmware updates
     - FPGA reconfiguration
  3. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: The changes don't involve:
     - Memory safety issues
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Any security-sensitive operations
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit #4 with subject "PCI: pciehp: Don't enable HPIE when resuming in poll mode" was marked as NO CVE, and that fixed a similar type of PCIe hotplug functionality issue.
  5. **The Fixed Commit (665745f27487)**: The commit being fixed simply re-added bandwidth notification functionality that had been previously removed due to log spam issues. It's a feature addition, not a security fix.
  This is a straightforward bug fix for device management functionality in the PCIe hotplug subsystem that prevents incorrect device removal due to spurious events. It has no security implications.
c3be50f7547cc PCI: pciehp: Ignore Presence Detect Changed caused by DPC
- [sasha] Based on my detailed analysis of the commit and examination of the kernel code:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a functional issue, not a security vulnerability. The changes address spurious Presence Detect Changed (PDC) events that occur as a side effect of DPC (Downstream Port Containment) recovery on older PCIe ports using in-band presence detection. 
  Key points from the code analysis:
  1. DPC is an error containment mechanism that temporarily disables links when errors occur
  2. On ports with in-band presence detection, link state changes during DPC recovery trigger false PDC events
  3. The fix adds logic to ignore these spurious events by checking `!ctrl->inband_presence_disabled` and calling `pciehp_device_replaced()` to verify if an actual device replacement occurred
  4. The `pciehp_device_replaced()` function performs thorough device identity verification (vendor/device IDs, class, revision, subsystem IDs, and DSN)
  This is a reliability improvement that prevents unnecessary device teardown and re-enumeration during error recovery. There's no security boundary crossed, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure, and no denial of service vulnerability being fixed. The commit simply makes PCIe error recovery more robust by avoiding false positive device removal detections.
1f4d382769e3b phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Do no set rk_hdptx_phy->rate in case of errors
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. 
  The issue is about the order of operations in `rk_hdptx_ropll_tmds_cmn_config()`. Previously, the function would set `hdptx->rate = rate * 100` at the beginning of the function, before performing any actual hardware configuration. If any of the subsequent operations failed (like `rk_hdptx_post_enable_pll()`), the function would return an error, but `hdptx->rate` would remain set to the incorrect value.
  This is problematic because:
  1. **Clock framework inconsistency**: The `hdptx->rate` field is used by the clock framework operations:
     - `rk_hdptx_phy_clk_prepare()` uses `hdptx->rate / 100` to configure the PHY
     - `rk_hdptx_phy_clk_recalc_rate()` returns `hdptx->rate` to report the current clock rate
  2. **Stale rate value on failure**: If `rk_hdptx_ropll_tmds_cmn_config()` fails after setting `hdptx->rate`, the driver state becomes inconsistent - it reports a rate that was never successfully configured in hardware.
  3. **Subsequent operations may use wrong rate**: Later calls to `rk_hdptx_phy_clk_prepare()` would use this stale rate value, potentially causing incorrect hardware configuration.
  The fix moves the `hdptx->rate = rate * 100` assignment to after `rk_hdptx_post_enable_pll()` succeeds, ensuring the rate is only updated when the hardware configuration is successful.
  **NO**
  This is a logic error that causes driver state inconsistency but does not have security implications. The issue:
  - Does not involve memory corruption, buffer overflows, or out-of-bounds access
  - Does not affect access control or privilege levels
  - Does not create exploitable conditions
  - Only affects the correctness of clock rate reporting/configuration within the driver
  - The worst case is incorrect display timing, not a security vulnerability
  Similar to commit 1 (CVE Status: NO) which was a missing header include, this is a driver correctness fix without security impact.
0422253ac1919 phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Fix clock ratio setup
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that corrects the clock ratio setup for HDMI PHY configuration. The change is from `rate >= 3400000` to `rate > HDMI14_MAX_RATE / 100` (where HDMI14_MAX_RATE is 340000000, so this becomes `rate > 3400000`).
  2. **No security impact**: The bug only affects the incorrect selection of clock ratios when operating at exactly 340 MHz (the HDMI 1.4 maximum rate). This would cause incorrect PHY settings but does not create any security vulnerabilities such as:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond simple functional issues
  3. **Limited scope**: The impact is limited to incorrect display functionality when operating at the exact boundary between HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 rates. It's a boundary condition error in hardware configuration.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, they all deal with display/PHY driver fixes for functional issues (clock frequencies, timing configurations, etc.) and none were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves hardware compatibility and functionality, but it does not meet the criteria for CVE assignment as it does not pose any security risks.
8f2efdbc303fe rtc: sh: assign correct interrupts with DT
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security impact. Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes an interrupt assignment bug in the rtc-sh driver where interrupts were mixed up when using Device Tree configuration. While this is a functional bug that causes incorrect interrupt handling, it does not represent a security vulnerability for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited scope**: The bug only affects RTC (Real-Time Clock) functionality, which is not a security-critical component. The RTC is used for timekeeping and alarms, not for access control or security enforcement.
  2. **No privilege escalation**: The incorrect interrupt mapping does not allow unprivileged users to gain elevated privileges or bypass security mechanisms.
  3. **No memory corruption**: The bug simply causes the wrong interrupt handler to be called for each interrupt type (alarm handler for periodic interrupts, etc.). Each handler still operates within its normal bounds - they just clear the wrong status bits and generate incorrect event types.
  4. **No information disclosure**: While the wrong event types are reported to userspace (e.g., RTC_UF instead of RTC_AF), this does not leak sensitive information.
  5. **Denial of Service impact is minimal**: The worst case is that RTC alarms might not work correctly or wake-up functionality could be impaired, but this doesn't compromise system security.
  6. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked as CVE Status: NO), they also fix functional bugs in drivers (incorrect interrupt assignments, clock ordering, memory leaks) without security implications.
  The commit is a straightforward bug fix that restores proper functionality but does not address any security vulnerability.
fb1bf1067de97 rust: alloc: add missing invariant in Vec::set_len()
- [sasha] I'll continue with the analysis based on the provided commit information.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It adds documentation (an invariant comment) to the `Vec::set_len()` method in the Rust kernel allocator code. The change is:
  1. **Nature of change**: The commit only adds a comment (`// INVARIANT: By the safety requirements...`) to document an existing safety requirement. No actual code logic is changed.
  2. **No security fix**: The commit message states it "adds missing invariant" - this refers to adding documentation, not fixing a security issue. The safety requirements already existed and were enforced by the `unsafe` marker and the debug assertion.
  3. **Documentation improvement**: This is a documentation improvement to make the code's safety requirements more explicit for future developers and code reviewers.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve implementing new Rust infrastructure for the kernel (Vec type, ArrayLayout, IntoIterator, Allocator trait, Vmalloc allocator). These are feature additions and infrastructure improvements, not security fixes.
  The commit improves code clarity and maintainability but does not address any security vulnerability that could be exploited.
56e84c64fc257 cifs: Fix validation of SMB1 query reparse point response
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Missing Input Validation Leading to Potential Buffer Overruns**: The original code did not validate the `SetupCount` field before accessing `ByteCount`. The structure layout shows that `SetupCount` determines how many setup words follow, and if it's not 1, the offset to `ByteCount` would be incorrect, potentially leading to out-of-bounds reads.
  2. **Insufficient Data Truncation Check**: The commit adds a critical validation that `data_count != le16_to_cpu(io_rsp->ReturnedDataLen)`. Without this check, the server could claim to have returned more data than was actually transmitted, which could lead to reading beyond the buffer boundaries when parsing the reparse point data.
  3. **Security Impact**: These validation failures could allow a malicious SMB server to:
     - Cause the client to read memory beyond the allocated buffer
     - Potentially crash the client system or expose sensitive memory contents
     - This is especially concerning as SMB clients often connect to untrusted or compromised servers
  4. **Attack Vector**: This vulnerability can be triggered remotely by any SMB server that the client connects to, making it a network-accessible vulnerability with no user interaction required beyond establishing the SMB connection.
  The commit message explicitly states it "Fixes" a previous commit and adds multiple validation checks that were missing, confirming this addresses security-relevant bugs in SMB1 protocol handling.
a913ef6fd883c perf callchain: Always populate the addr_location map when adding IP
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit is a bug fix for the perf profiling tool, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when the `symbols` parameter is false (introduced in commit 02b2705017d2e5ad), the code was not populating the map information in the addr_location structure. This caused problems finding the DSO (Dynamic Shared Object) when symbols were disabled.
  The fix ensures that even when symbols are disabled, the map information is still populated by calling `thread__find_map()` instead of `thread__find_symbol()`. This is a functional correctness issue in a userspace profiling tool, not a security vulnerability:
  1. It only affects the perf tool's ability to correctly resolve callchains when symbols are disabled
  2. There's no privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure
  3. The worst case is that perf fails to find DSO information when profiling
  4. It's a regression fix for functionality, not a security issue
  The similar commits analyzed also show that perf tool bugs like NULL pointer dereferences and map resolution issues are consistently marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are userspace tool functionality issues rather than kernel security vulnerabilities.
5402c4d4d2000 exportfs: require ->fh_to_parent() to encode connectable file handles
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit adds a validation check to prevent encoding connectable file handles when the filesystem lacks the required `fh_to_parent` operation. Without this check, the system could create file handles marked as "connectable" that would later fail to decode with `-ESTALE` when the missing `fh_to_parent` operation is needed.
  This is a correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The code already handles the missing operation gracefully during decode by returning an error. The fix is preventive - ensuring invalid file handles aren't created in the first place. Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed triggerable WARN_ON assertions causing potential DoS), this commit doesn't fix an exploitable security issue, just improves input validation.
15ecd83dc0627 rust: file: mark `LocalFile` as `repr(transparent)`
- [sasha] NO, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  While this commit fixes a memory safety issue where unsafe code assumes `LocalFile` has the same layout as `bindings::file`, this is primarily a correctness fix rather than an exploitable security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Theoretical vs Practical Impact**: The missing `#[repr(transparent)]` could theoretically cause layout mismatches, but in practice, Rust compilers typically don't add padding to single-field structs, making exploitation highly unlikely.
  2. **Unsafe Code Analysis**: Looking at the affected methods like `dec_ref()` which performs `obj.cast().as_ptr()` and `from_raw_file()` which casts pointers, these operations assume layout compatibility. However, since `LocalFile` contains only a single `Opaque<bindings::file>` field, the compiler would need to actively add padding or change alignment for this to cause issues.
  3. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The provided similar commits (rust type fixes, signature corrections, casting cleanups) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" despite fixing type safety issues. This commit follows the same pattern of preventative correctness fixes.
  4. **No Evidence of Exploitation**: There's no indication this has been or could be practically exploited. The fix is preventative to ensure future compiler compatibility rather than addressing an active vulnerability.
  This is an important correctness fix that prevents potential future issues, but doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it doesn't represent an exploitable vulnerability in current implementations.
dd59137bfe70c fs/dax: Fix "don't skip locked entries when scanning entries"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Bug Type**: This is a functional correctness bug in the XArray iterator handling, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that `xas_pause()` advances the XArray index, causing the current entry to be skipped when the iterator resumes.
  2. **Impact Analysis**:
     - The bug causes `wait_entry_unlocked_exclusive()` to skip entries after waiting for them to become unlocked
     - This leads to a WARNING (WARN_ON_ONCE) in the truncate path, indicating an unexpected DAX entry was found
     - The code handles this gracefully by deleting the mapping entry to prevent infinite loops
  3. **Not a Security Boundary Crossing**: 
     - The bug does not allow:
       - Privilege escalation
       - Information disclosure
       - Denial of service beyond a warning message
       - Memory corruption
     - File systems already have proper locking mechanisms (as mentioned in the truncate.c comment) to prevent race conditions
  4. **Comparison with Similar CVE-assigned Commits**:
     - The CVE-assigned similar commits (erofs and NFS) involved:
       - Potential oops/crashes when dereferencing invalid entries
       - Deadlock scenarios that could cause system hangs
       - Race conditions that could lead to use-after-free
     - This commit only causes incorrect iteration that triggers a warning
  5. **Recovery Path**: The code has explicit handling for this scenario - when an unexpected DAX entry is found, it deletes the mapping entry to recover, preventing any serious consequences.
  The fix simply changes `xas_pause()` to `xas_reset()` to prevent the index advancement, ensuring the correct entry is reloaded after waiting. This is a correctness fix rather than a security fix.
8c56bfe53bd88 perf trace: Set errpid to false for rseq and set_robust_list
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a display bug in the perf trace userspace tool, not a kernel security vulnerability. The change removes incorrect `.errpid = true` flags from the `rseq` and `set_robust_list` syscall definitions in `tools/perf/builtin-trace.c`.
  The bug causes perf trace to incorrectly interpret the return values of these syscalls as process IDs:
  - `rseq` returns 0 on success or negative error codes (-EINVAL, -EFAULT, -EPERM, -EBUSY)
  - `set_robust_list` returns 0 on success or -EINVAL on error
  Neither syscall returns a PID, so the errpid flag should be false. With errpid=true, perf trace would attempt to look up a thread with ID 0 (on success) or a negative ID (on error) and display its name, resulting in incorrect output formatting.
  This is purely a userspace diagnostic tool issue with no security implications - it only affects how perf trace displays syscall results to users. Similar to the provided examples (commits 1-4) which were all perf tool fixes marked as "CVE Status: NO", this commit does not warrant a CVE.
c25a89770d1f2 nfs_localio: change nfsd_file_put_local() to take a pointer to __rcu pointer
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is a code refactoring and compiler compatibility fix that addresses warnings with gcc-8, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit:
  1. **Fixes compiler warnings**: The primary purpose is to address compiler complaints from older gcc-8 about RCU pointer handling where "the internals of struct nfsd_file are not known"
  2. **Refactors code organization**: It moves `xchg()` and `unrcu_pointer()` operations from call sites into the `nfsd_file_put_local()` function itself, improving code organization
  3. **No security impact**: The functionality remains identical - it's purely moving where certain operations happen to satisfy compiler type checking. No race conditions, memory corruption, or other security issues are being fixed
  4. **Type safety improvement**: The change involves casting between `__kernel` and `__rcu` pointers in a safe manner (weakening pointer attributes) to work around compiler limitations
  This is a typical maintenance commit that improves code quality and compiler compatibility without addressing any security vulnerability.
21fb440346951 nfs_localio: protect race between nfs_uuid_put() and nfs_close_local_fh()
- [sasha] Let me analyze what I can see from the code changes and commit message:
  Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a race condition fix between internal NFS LOCALIO operations (`nfs_uuid_put()` and `nfs_close_local_fh()`). The race condition could lead to:
     - Files not being properly purged from the cache
     - Use-after-free of the `nfs_file_localio` structure
     
     However, these are functional/reliability issues rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The NFS LOCALIO feature is a performance optimization that allows local file operations when NFS client and server are on the same machine. The race condition affects only this specific optimization path, not general NFS security.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The commit message and code changes show this is about proper synchronization during cleanup operations. There's no indication of:
     - Unauthorized access to files
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote exploitation
  4. **Timing-Dependent Race**: The race requires specific timing between cleanup operations and would be difficult to reliably trigger for malicious purposes.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked as "CVE Status: NO"), they involve:
     - Reference counting fixes
     - Cache management improvements  
     - File handle cleanup issues
     - Race condition fixes in file operations
     
     None of these were assigned CVEs, and this commit follows the same pattern.
  The commit fixes a functional bug that could cause resource cleanup issues but does not represent a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
74fc55ab2a6a0 nfs_localio: duplicate nfs_close_local_fh()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Answer: YES**
  This commit fixes a race condition in the NFS LOCALIO subsystem that could lead to several security issues:
  1. **Use-After-Free vulnerability**: The race between `nfs_uuid_put()` and `nfs_close_local_fh()` could result in one path accessing memory that has been freed by the other path.
  2. **Memory corruption**: The concurrent manipulation of shared data structures (particularly the list operations and pointer clearing) without proper synchronization could corrupt kernel memory.
  3. **Double-free potential**: Both paths could attempt to free the same `nfsd_file` resources if the race timing allows.
  The commit message explicitly states "These two can race, and handling the race properly while avoiding excessive locking will require different handling on each side." This acknowledges the security-relevant race condition.
  The fix addresses this by:
  - Open-coding the cleanup logic in `nfs_uuid_put()` with proper ordering
  - Ensuring atomic exchanges of file pointers using `xchg()`
  - Carefully ordering the clearing of `nfl->nfs_uuid` AFTER removing from the list
  - Adding a comment "Now we can allow racing nfs_close_local_fh() to skip the locking"
  While the most likely impact would be denial of service through kernel crashes, race conditions involving memory management in the kernel can sometimes be exploited for privilege escalation, making this a security vulnerability worthy of a CVE assignment.
e6f7e1487ab52 nfs_localio: simplify interface to nfsd for getting nfsd_file
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is primarily a code refactoring that simplifies the interface between NFS and NFSD for handling local I/O operations. While it does mention fixing "possible races", these are not described as security vulnerabilities.
  2. **Race condition prevention, not exploitation fix**: The commit states it "avoids possible races with the nfsd_file being freed before the final reference can be taken" by getting an extra reference *before* storing the nfsd_file. This is a preventive measure to improve code robustness, not a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability.
  3. **Compiler compatibility issue**: A significant part of the motivation is fixing compilation errors with older GCC versions (gcc-8) related to rcu_dereference() usage, which is clearly not a security issue.
  4. **Similar commits without CVEs**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (NO CVE): "nfsd: allow nfsd_file_get to sanely handle a NULL pointer" - defensive programming
     - Commit 2 (NO CVE): "NFSD: Ensure nf_inode is never dereferenced" - code hardening
     - Commit 3 (NO CVE): "nfsd: add list_head nf_gc to struct nfsd_file" - fixing leaks through proper list management
  5. **Contrast with CVE-assigned commits**: The commits that received CVEs (4 and 5) explicitly fixed use-after-free vulnerabilities in nfsd_file_put(), where dereferencing could occur after the structure was freed. This commit doesn't fix such a condition - it prevents it from potentially occurring.
  The commit is a proactive improvement to prevent potential race conditions rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability.
77e82fb2c6c27 nfs_localio: always hold nfsd net ref with nfsd_file ref
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. It fixes multiple race conditions and use-after-free vulnerabilities in the NFS LOCALIO functionality:
  1. **Use-after-free vulnerability**: The improper reference counting between `nfsd_file` and `nfsd_net` could lead to scenarios where NFSD structures are freed while NFS clients still hold references, causing memory corruption and potential crashes.
  2. **Module unload race**: Without proper reference counting, the NFSD module could be unloaded while NFS clients were still accessing NFSD functions, leading to crashes when trying to execute code that no longer exists.
  3. **Shutdown synchronization failure**: The commit message explicitly states that "nfsd might think it has completely shut down local IO, but hasn't and has no way to wait for those active IO requests to complete." This could leave files accessible after NFSD believes they've been cleaned up.
  The security impact includes:
  - **Availability**: System crashes, kernel panics, and RCU stalls
  - **Integrity**: Memory corruption from use-after-free conditions
  - **Potential for exploitation**: Use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for privilege escalation
  The fix ensures that whenever a client holds a valid `nfsd_file`, there's an associated reference count on the `nfsd_net`, preventing premature cleanup and eliminating the race conditions.
ed9be317330c7 nfs_localio: use cmpxchg() to install new nfs_file_localio
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this warrants a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit is a race condition fix in the NFS LOCALIO subsystem that could potentially lead to resource leaks (orphaned file handles) when multiple threads race between opening and closing local file handles. While this is a legitimate bug fix, it does not appear to meet the threshold for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: The primary consequence is resource leakage (memory/file handles), not memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data corruption that could be exploited by an attacker.
  2. **Local-only Impact**: The LOCALIO feature is for optimizing NFS performance when client and server are on the same system. This limits the attack surface significantly.
  3. **Requires Specific Race Timing**: The race condition requires precise timing between threads opening and closing file handles, making it difficult to reliably exploit.
  4. **No Data Integrity Issues**: Unlike the similar commits shown (which involved actual data corruption like "memory corruption can occur" and "NFSv3 data corruption"), this fix prevents resource leaks rather than data corruption.
  5. **No Direct Exploitability**: There's no clear path for an attacker to leverage this race condition to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause system compromise.
  The commit is fixing a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. While the race could theoretically lead to resource exhaustion over time, this would require sustained activity and is more of a denial-of-service concern in extreme cases rather than a direct security vulnerability.
dd862da61e911 nfs: fix incorrect handling of large-number NFS errors in nfs4_do_mkdir()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this commit fixes a security vulnerability.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in error handling, not a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that `nfs4_do_mkdir()` was returning NFS-specific error codes (like NFS4ERR_DELAY = 10008) via `ERR_PTR()`. Since these values exceed MAX_ERRNO (4095), `IS_ERR()` would not recognize them as errors, and `PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO()` would return 0 (success) instead of the actual error.
  2. **Impact**: This would cause the kernel to:
     - Treat certain NFS errors as success (returning 0)
     - Potentially dereference an invalid pointer value (10008) as if it were a valid dentry pointer
     - This could lead to a kernel crash/oops
  3. **Security implications**: While this bug could cause a kernel crash, it does not:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Expose sensitive information
     - Allow unauthorized access
     - Enable any form of exploit beyond a DoS
  4. **Trigger conditions**: The bug only manifests when:
     - An NFS4 mkdir operation fails with specific NFS error codes > 4095
     - This is a normal error path, not an attack vector
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Commit 2 (CVE assigned) fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could be triggered
     - This commit fixes an error handling bug that results in incorrect behavior, similar to commits 1, 3, 4, and 5 which were not assigned CVEs
  The commit is a bug fix for incorrect error handling that could lead to a crash, but it does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
80c4de6ab44c1 nfs: ignore SB_RDONLY when remounting nfs
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and its context, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional issue where multiple mounts of the same NFS filesystem with different ro/rw flags would create redundant superblocks and cause mount state confusion. This is primarily a usability and correctness issue.
  2. **No Direct Security Exploitation**: The code changes don't fix a vulnerability that could be exploited for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data compromise. The issue is about mount state consistency rather than security boundary violations.
  3. **Limited Security Impact**: While the bug could cause confusion about whether a mount is read-only or read-write, it doesn't bypass NFS server-side permissions or allow unauthorized operations. The NFS server still enforces its own access controls regardless of client-side mount flags.
  4. **Preventive Measure**: The change is more about preventing mount state inconsistencies than fixing an exploitable security flaw. The addition of `fc->sb_flags_mask &= ~SB_RDONLY;` in nfs_reconfigure() ensures consistent behavior during remounts.
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, the ext4 commits that removed SB_RDONLY manipulation (commits 2 and 3) were assigned CVEs because they fixed race conditions that could lead to system freezes, deadlocks, or filesystem corruption - actual security issues. This NFS commit doesn't have such severe implications.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves NFS mount handling consistency, but it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability.
8cd9b785943c5 nfs: clear SB_RDONLY before getting superblock
- [sasha] Now I understand the full issue. Let me summarize my analysis:
  ## Analysis
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  ## Explanation
  This commit fixes a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: The bug causes NFSv3 rw mounts to incorrectly share a read-only superblock, resulting in write operations being rejected at the VFS layer with EROFS. This is a denial-of-service to legitimate operations, not a security bypass.
  2. **Security Impact**: The bug actually makes the system MORE restrictive than intended, not less. Users who should have write access (mounting with rw option) are denied write access. This is the opposite of a security vulnerability - it's an availability issue that prevents authorized operations.
  3. **Code Analysis**: 
     - The VFS layer properly checks `sb_rdonly()` before allowing writes (as seen in fs/namei.c)
     - The bug causes legitimate rw mounts to inherit the SB_RDONLY flag from a previous ro mount
     - The fix clears SB_RDONLY from `fc->sb_flags` before calling `sget_fc()` to ensure proper superblock selection
  4. **Comparison with Similar CVE-assigned Commits**: The CVE-assigned commits (ext4 and f2fs) involved improper manipulation of SB_RDONLY that could lead to system hangs, deadlocks, or race conditions with filesystem freezing operations. Those had actual security implications (DoS through system hang). This NFS bug simply denies writes that should be allowed.
  5. **Attack Surface**: There's no privilege escalation, data corruption, information leak, or system compromise possible through this bug. An attacker cannot gain unauthorized access or cause system instability.
  The commit fixes a functional regression where legitimate write operations fail, but does not address any security vulnerability.
c7a48ea9b919e perf trace: Always print return value for syscalls returning a pid
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a display/formatting bug in the `perf trace` tool where certain syscalls (like `set_robust_list` and `rseq`) were not printing their return values properly. The change simply ensures the return value is always printed for syscalls marked with `errpid`.
  2. **No security impact**: The bug only affects the output formatting of the perf trace tool - it doesn't:
     - Allow unauthorized access
     - Cause memory corruption
     - Enable privilege escalation
     - Expose sensitive information
     - Create any exploitable condition
  3. **Purely cosmetic fix**: The change moves the `fprintf(trace->output, "%ld", ret);` line outside the `if (child != NULL)` condition, ensuring the return value is printed even when the child process cannot be found. This is purely a user interface improvement.
  4. **Limited scope**: This only affects the perf trace tool's output display and has no impact on kernel security, system stability, or data integrity.
  The commit message clearly indicates this is fixing a display issue where return values weren't being shown for certain syscalls. The code change confirms it's just adjusting when the return value gets printed to the output stream.
a4a859eb6704a perf record: Fix incorrect --user-regs comments
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a trivial documentation fix that corrects an incorrect help message comment for the `--user-regs` option in perf record. The change is:
  ```diff
  - "sample selected machine registers on interrupt,"
  + "sample selected machine registers in user space,"
  ```
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **No code logic change**: The commit only changes a help text string. It does not modify any functional code, control flow, or data handling.
  2. **Documentation accuracy**: The original comment was copied incorrectly from the `--intr-regs` option. The `--user-regs` option samples user space registers, not registers "on interrupt". This is purely a documentation clarification.
  3. **No security impact**: The incorrect help text could at worst cause user confusion about what the option does, but it cannot lead to any security issues like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Information disclosure
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Memory corruption
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and involve:
     - Debug message placement fixes
     - Memory leak fixes in error paths
     - Test harness improvements
     - Other help message fixes
  This commit falls into the same category of minor quality/documentation improvements that do not warrant a CVE assignment.
ab73b29efd36f s390/uv: Improve splitting of large folios that cannot be split while dirty
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Functionality issue, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a livelock/hang condition when starting Protected Virtualization VMs on certain filesystems. While this prevents VMs from starting, it's not exploitable for malicious purposes - it's a compatibility issue between large folio support and PV VM initialization.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes in `s390_wiggle_split_folio()` add logic to handle dirty folios that can't be split by triggering writeback. This doesn't fix any:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  3. **Commit message explicitly states non-critical**: The message says "it simply not working is not critical in stable kernels", indicating this is a functionality/compatibility fix rather than a security fix.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is most similar to commits 1, 2, and 5 from the reference list, which were optimization/compatibility fixes that didn't receive CVEs. The commits that received CVEs (3 and 4) were fixing actual bugs with incorrect behavior in the memory management subsystem.
  5. **Specific use case**: The issue only occurs under specific conditions (PV VMs + iomap-based filesystems with large folio support) and doesn't create an attack vector - it simply prevents legitimate VM startup operations from completing.
bd428b8c79ed8 s390/uv: Always return 0 from s390_wiggle_split_folio() if successful
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and its context:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **It's a cleanup/refactoring commit**: The commit only changes the return value convention of `s390_wiggle_split_folio()` to make it more consistent and cleaner. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes are purely cosmetic - the function now returns 0 for success (including when no split was needed) instead of returning -EAGAIN when split was not requested. The caller (`make_hva_secure()`) is updated to handle this new convention correctly.
  3. **The actual security fix was in the parent commit**: The parent commit (3ec8a8330a1a) with the message "s390/uv: Don't return 0 from make_hva_secure() if the operation was not successful" was the actual fix that prevented a potential VM boot failure. That commit has a Fixes: tag and Cc: stable, indicating it was a real bug fix.
  4. **This is follow-up cleanup**: As stated in the parent commit message: "We'll cleanup s390_wiggle_split_folio() a bit next, to also return 0 if no split was required." This commit is that promised cleanup.
  5. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The changes don't introduce or fix any security boundary violations, information leaks, or access control bypasses.
  The commit simply improves code clarity by making the return value convention more consistent - returning 0 for all successful cases rather than mixing 0 and -EAGAIN for different success scenarios.
3ec8a8330a1aa s390/uv: Don't return 0 from make_hva_secure() if the operation was not successful
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. When `unpack_one()` returns 0 (success), the loop increments the offset and moves to the next page. If it returns `-EAGAIN`, it retries the same page.
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  The bug is a security vulnerability in s390's Protected Virtualization (PV) implementation. When unpacking a protected VM image:
  1. **The Bug**: If `make_hva_secure()` encounters a large folio that needs splitting, after successfully splitting it via `s390_wiggle_split_folio()` (which returns 0), the function incorrectly returns 0 instead of -EAGAIN.
  2. **Security Impact**: This causes `kvm_s390_pv_unpack()` to skip securing the page entirely, moving to the next page as if the current one was successfully secured. The result is that guest memory pages that should be encrypted and protected from the hypervisor remain unprotected and accessible.
  3. **Code Evidence**: In `kvm_s390_pv_unpack()`:
     ```c
     if (ret == -EAGAIN) {
         continue;  // Retry same page
     }
     if (ret)
         break;     // Error, stop unpacking
     offset += PAGE_SIZE;  // Success (ret=0), move to next page
     ```
  4. **Violation of Security Model**: Protected Virtualization guarantees that guest memory is encrypted and inaccessible to the hypervisor. This bug violates that guarantee by leaving pages unprotected while the system believes they are secure.
  5. **Exploitability**: While requiring hypervisor-level access and specific conditions (large folios), this represents a confidentiality breach where protected guest memory could be exposed to an untrusted hypervisor.
  The commit message confirms this is a real issue observed "with follow-up patches where we split large pagecache XFS folios" and results in "issues and fail booting the VM" - indicating the pages are not properly secured.
fef8f648bb477 perf symbol: Fix use-after-free in filename__read_build_id
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I'll provide my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Tool vs Kernel**: This is a bug in the `perf` userspace tool, not in the kernel itself. The file path `tools/perf/util/symbol-minimal.c` indicates this is part of the perf userspace utility.
  2. **Local Tool Bug**: The use-after-free occurs in `filename__read_build_id()`, which is a function that reads ELF files from the filesystem. This is a local tool bug that affects the tool's operation but doesn't represent a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
  3. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The bug occurs when parsing ELF files that the user running perf already has access to. There's no privilege escalation, no ability to access unauthorized data, and no way for an attacker to exploit this to compromise the system.
  4. **AddressSanitizer Detection**: The bug was found by AddressSanitizer during development/testing, not as a security vulnerability in the wild. It's a memory safety issue that causes the tool to crash, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the perf tool bugs (commits 1-5) were assigned CVEs. They were all treated as regular bugs despite involving memory issues like use-after-free, memory leaks, etc.
  6. **Impact Limited to Tool Functionality**: The worst outcome is that the perf tool crashes when trying to read build IDs from certain ELF files. This doesn't allow code execution, data exfiltration, or any other security-relevant impact.
  The commit is fixing a legitimate bug that could cause perf to crash, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it's not a security vulnerability that could be exploited to harm the system or its users.
2a2a7f5e7deff perf pmu: Avoid segv for missing name/alias_name in wildcarding
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Looking at the commit changes:
  The fix adds a NULL check in the final loop at lines 2052-2059:
  ```c
  for (size_t i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(names); i++) {
      const char *name = names[i];
      
      if (!name)  // THIS CHECK WAS MISSING
          continue;
          
      if (wildcard && perf_pmu__match_wildcard_uncore(name, to_match))
          return true;
      if (!wildcard && perf_pmu__match_ignoring_suffix_uncore(name, to_match))
          return true;
  }
  ```
  The issue is that `names[i]` could be NULL (either `pmu->name` or `pmu->alias_name`), and passing NULL to `perf_pmu__match_wildcard_uncore()` or `perf_pmu__match_ignoring_suffix_uncore()` would cause a segmentation fault when those functions try to dereference the pointer.
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This is a NULL pointer dereference bug in the perf tool (userspace tool), not in the kernel itself. CVEs are typically not assigned for bugs in userspace tools that are part of the kernel source tree unless they have significant security implications. This is a simple programming error that would cause the perf tool to crash with a segmentation fault if it encounters a PMU with a missing name or alias_name field during wildcard matching.
  The bug:
  1. Only affects the perf userspace tool, not kernel code
  2. Would result in a denial of service (crash) of the perf tool itself
  3. Does not provide privilege escalation or information disclosure
  4. Does not affect system stability or security boundaries
  5. Is a simple oversight where NULL checks were present in other loops but missing in this specific wildcard matching loop
  Similar to the reference commits which were marked "CVE Status: NO", this is a bug fix for functionality/stability issues in the perf tool rather than a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
34ecde3c56066 iomap: don't lose folio dropbehind state for overwrites
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes provided:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Performance/Optimization Bug Only**: The commit fixes a bug where the DONTCACHE flag was being lost during overwrites in the iomap buffered write path. This caused pages to remain in the cache when they should have been dropped - a performance issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No Data Integrity Issues**: The code changes show this is purely about preserving the `IOMAP_IOEND_DONTCACHE` flag through the write completion path. The bug doesn't cause data corruption, data loss, or allow unauthorized data access.
  3. **Specific Code Changes**:
     - In `iomap_add_to_ioend()`: Adds check for `folio_test_dropbehind(folio)` to set the flag
     - In XFS: Adds helper `xfs_ioend_needs_wq_completion()` to ensure DONTCACHE completions run in workqueue context (needed for page invalidation)
     - These changes ensure proper cleanup behavior, not security enforcement
  4. **Impact is Limited to Performance**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes "extra page cache being instantiated" - meaning pages stay cached when they shouldn't. This affects memory usage and cache efficiency but poses no security risk.
  5. **Similar to Historical Non-CVE Commits**: The provided similar commits (commits 1-5) all deal with iomap/filesystem correctness issues and race conditions but were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they don't have security implications.
  This is a legitimate bug fix that ensures the RWF_DONTCACHE feature works correctly for overwrites, but it's a functional/performance issue rather than a security vulnerability.
9fcebcb37c3e0 mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Refine GCE_GCTL_VALUE setting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a code refactoring/cleanup commit that improves the design of GCE_GCTL_VALUE register handling. The commit refactors `cmdq_sw_ddr_enable()` into `cmdq_gctl_value_toggle()` and moves it to runtime PM callbacks.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The changes don't fix a security vulnerability. They address a design issue where:
     - The old code enabled/disabled clocks unnecessarily when writing to GCE_GCTL_VALUE
     - The new code properly handles the register writes within the runtime PM framework
     - For SoCs with GCE in MMINFRA using MMINFRA_AO power, this allows writing without enabling clocks
  3. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The original code from commit 7abd037aa581 had a suboptimal design but not a security flaw
     - The issue was about power management efficiency and proper clock handling
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issues
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: The similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" all fixed actual bugs:
     - Wrong sizeof usage (memory allocation bug)
     - Race conditions in PM runtime handling
     - Improper shutdown sequences
     
     This commit, however, is a design improvement without security implications.
  5. **Code changes show**:
     - Removal of `cmdq_sw_ddr_enable()` function
     - Introduction of `cmdq_gctl_value_toggle()` with better logic
     - Moving the toggle calls to appropriate runtime PM callbacks
     - No fixes for buffer overflows, access control issues, or other security bugs
  The commit improves code quality and power management but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
f5cb07ec6aabd mailbox: imx: Fix TXDB_V2 sending
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a timeout issue in mailbox communication, not a security vulnerability. The change increases a timeout from 1ms to 10ms and adds retry logic to handle timing variations in SCMI firmware processing.
  2. **Functional Fix Only**: The commit addresses a functional problem where Linux MU TXDB_V2 could timeout when communicating with SCMI firmware during high-priority operations. This is a reliability/stability issue, not a security issue.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The timeout condition described:
     - Cannot be triggered maliciously
     - Does not lead to privilege escalation
     - Does not expose sensitive information
     - Does not cause memory corruption or other security issues
  4. **Design Limitation, Not Bug**: The commit message explicitly states this is due to NXP SCMI firmware design where "all processing logic codes are in interrupt context" and there's "no recover logic" for timeouts. This is addressing a known design limitation, not fixing a security flaw.
  5. **Similar to Commit 1**: This is similar to the first reference commit which also dealt with timeout/timing issues in SCMI communication and was marked "CVE Status: NO".
  The change simply makes the driver more robust by increasing the timeout value and adding retry logic to handle cases where the firmware needs more time to process requests. This is a quality-of-service improvement, not a security fix.
d635ba4207c31 mailbox: mchp-ipc-sbi: Fix COMPILE_TEST build error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a build configuration error, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a compilation failure that occurs when `COMPILE_TEST` is enabled but `RISCV_SBI` is disabled.
  2. **Root cause**: The driver uses RISC-V SBI (Supervisor Binary Interface) functions like `sbi_ecall()` and the `struct sbiret` type, which are only available when `CONFIG_RISCV_SBI` is enabled. When `COMPILE_TEST` allows building without RISCV_SBI, these symbols are undefined, causing a build failure.
  3. **No security impact**: This is purely a build-time configuration issue that prevents the kernel from compiling in certain configurations. There is no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Any runtime security issue
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 4 (rockchip typo fix) which was marked "CVE Status: NO" is also a build/configuration fix with no security implications, similar to this one.
  5. **The fix**: The change simply adjusts the Kconfig dependencies to ensure the driver can only be built when the required RISCV_SBI infrastructure is available, moving `COMPILE_TEST` to a different dependency line.
  This is a standard build dependency fix that ensures proper compilation, not a security vulnerability fix.
628e124404b3d perf tests switch-tracking: Fix timestamp comparison
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The fix is in `tools/perf/tests/switch-tracking.c`, which is purely test infrastructure code for the perf tool's test suite. The bug causes incorrect sorting of events due to integer overflow when the `compar` function returns a 64-bit timestamp difference as an int, potentially causing test failures on ARM64 platforms.
  This is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It's in test code only (built as `perf-test-$(CONFIG_LIBTRACEEVENT) += switch-tracking.o`)
  2. It cannot be exploited by attackers
  3. It has no security impact - only affects test reliability
  4. The commit message explicitly states it fixes intermittent test failures ("The test might fail on the Arm64 platform")
  The fix properly converts the comparison result to -1, 0, or 1 as expected by qsort(), which is a standard bug fix for test infrastructure with no security implications.
96959283a58d9 Drivers: hv: Always select CONFIG_SYSFB for Hyper-V guests
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a security vulnerability involving uninitialized variable usage that can lead to undefined behavior.
  **Security Analysis:**
  1. **Uninitialized Variable Bug**: In `vmbus_reserve_fb()` (drivers/hv/vmbus_drv.c:2232), when running on Gen2 VMs with CONFIG_SYSFB disabled:
     - The `size` variable is declared at line 2234 but never initialized in the Gen2 VM path
     - At line 2271, this uninitialized `size` is used: `for (; !fb_mmio && (size >= 0x100000); size >>= 1)`
  2. **Security Impact**:
     - **Undefined behavior**: Using uninitialized stack memory can contain arbitrary values
     - **MMIO allocation issues**: Wrong size values could lead to incorrect MMIO space reservations
     - **Driver conflicts**: As described in the commit message, this can cause framebuffer MMIO space to be assigned to other drivers (e.g., NVMe controllers), leading to system instability and boot failures
     - **Potential information disclosure**: Stack memory contents could influence MMIO allocation patterns
  3. **Attack Scenario**: While not easily exploitable remotely, this could be leveraged by:
     - Local attackers to cause denial of service
     - Potentially influence MMIO allocations to create driver conflicts
     - In virtualized environments, this could lead to guest instability
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This issue is similar in nature to commit 2 and 3 in the reference list, which dealt with framebuffer memory access issues in Hyper-V and were assigned CVEs because they could cause system hangs and undefined behavior.
  The fix correctly addresses this by ensuring CONFIG_SYSFB is always selected for HYPERV (except in VTL mode where framebuffers aren't used), preventing the uninitialized variable path from ever being taken.
db26d62d79e40 netfs: Fix undifferentiation of DIO reads from unbuffered reads
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that addresses incorrect differentiation between DIO reads (O_DIRECT) and unbuffered reads (cache=none mount option) in CIFS. The commit message explicitly states this is about protocol correctness - "The difference is flagged in the protocol and the server may behave differently."
  2. **No security impact in the code changes**: The changes simply add a new enum value `NETFS_UNBUFFERED_READ` to differentiate from `NETFS_DIO_READ` and update various checks to handle both cases appropriately. This is purely a logical correction.
  3. **Contrast with CVE-marked similar commits**: The similar commit that was marked with CVE (3f6bc9e3ab9b) fixed a kernel crash/warning condition that could be triggered by userspace operations, which represents a potential denial of service vulnerability. In contrast, this commit only fixes protocol-level behavior differences.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: The issue being fixed is that Windows Server requires DIO reads to be block-aligned, while unbuffered reads don't have this requirement. Without this fix, some operations might fail that should succeed, but there's no security boundary violation, privilege escalation, or crash condition.
  5. **Code analysis shows benign changes**: Looking at the actual changes, they mostly involve adding checks like:
     ```c
     if (subreq->rreq->origin != NETFS_UNBUFFERED_READ &&
         subreq->rreq->origin != NETFS_DIO_READ)
     ```
     These are simple logic corrections to ensure both read types are handled appropriately.
  This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
59d60c16ed414 mfd: stmpe-spi: Correct the name used in MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit without CVEKERNELTREE access.
  Looking at the commit:
  **Subject**: mfd: stmpe-spi: Correct the name used in MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
  **Changes**: 
  - In `drivers/mfd/stmpe-spi.c`, line 132 changes from:
    ```c
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(spi, stmpe_id);
    ```
    to:
    ```c
    MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(spi, stmpe_spi_id);
    ```
  **Analysis**:
  1. **Type of issue**: This is a compilation error fix. The commit message clearly states there was an "error: use of undeclared identifier 'stmpe_id'". The code was referencing a non-existent identifier.
  2. **Security implications**: None. This is purely a build/compilation fix that corrects an incorrect identifier name in the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE macro.
  3. **What MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE does**: This macro creates module aliases for automatic module loading. The incorrect identifier prevented proper module metadata generation but did not create any security vulnerability.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked CVE Status: NO), they all involve:
     - Adding missing device ID tables
     - Fixing device ID table references
     - Correcting module aliases
     None of these were assigned CVEs because they don't fix security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Impact**: The bug would cause a compilation error, preventing the module from building. It's not a runtime security issue.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a compilation error where MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE referenced an undeclared identifier 'stmpe_id' instead of the correct 'stmpe_spi_id'. This is a build-time issue that prevents the module from compiling, not a security vulnerability. The fix simply corrects the identifier name to match the actual spi_device_id array defined in the same file.
f41cc37f4bc0e mfd: exynos-lpass: Fix another error handling path in exynos_lpass_probe()
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific changes in the commit patch we're evaluating:
  Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a resource management problem in an error handling path. If `devm_of_platform_populate()` fails during probe, the driver doesn't properly clean up the resources it initialized (pm_runtime state and hardware enablement via `exynos_lpass_enable()`).
  2. **Limited impact**: The bug only occurs when the probe function fails, which is typically during system initialization. This is not an exploitable condition that could be triggered by an attacker.
  3. **No security boundaries crossed**: The leak involves:
     - PM runtime reference count not being disabled
     - Hardware not being properly disabled via `exynos_lpass_disable()`
     - These are driver state management issues, not memory disclosure or privilege escalation
  4. **Resource leak nature**: While this is indeed a resource leak (similar to the CVE-assigned commits shown), the key difference is:
     - The similar commits fixed leaks of system resources like memory mappings (iounmap), DMA channels, IRQs, and dynamically allocated memory
     - This commit fixes PM runtime state and hardware enablement state, which are less critical from a security perspective
  5. **No attack vector**: There's no way for an unprivileged user to trigger this error path maliciously. The probe failure would happen due to system configuration issues, not user input.
  The fix properly adds cleanup via `devm_add_action_or_reset()` to ensure resources are cleaned up on error, which is good practice but doesn't address a security vulnerability.
b70b84556eeca mfd: exynos-lpass: Avoid calling exynos_lpass_disable() twice in exynos_lpass_remove()
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. The issue is that:
  1. The original code calls `exynos_lpass_disable()` unconditionally first
  2. Then it calls `pm_runtime_disable()`
  3. Then it conditionally calls `exynos_lpass_disable()` again if the device is not suspended
  This creates a scenario where if the device is not runtime suspended, `exynos_lpass_disable()` is called twice, which means:
  - `clk_disable_unprepare()` is called twice on the same clock
  - This triggers WARN() messages in the kernel due to reference count imbalance
  - The clock subsystem detects this as a programming error
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The issue is a reference counting bug that causes WARN() messages but does not create any security vulnerability. Double-calling `clk_disable_unprepare()` is caught by the kernel's defensive programming and results in warnings, not exploitable conditions.
  2. **No Memory Corruption**: The clk subsystem has proper checks (as seen in the code with `WARN(core->enable_count == 0, "%s already disabled\n", core->name)`) that prevent any memory corruption or undefined behavior.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation**: This bug cannot be exploited to gain elevated privileges or bypass security boundaries.
  4. **Limited Impact**: The worst outcome is kernel warning messages in the log. The kernel's clock framework is designed to handle such programming errors gracefully.
  5. **Driver-Specific**: This is a simple logic error in a specific MFD driver's remove path, not a systemic security issue.
  This is similar to the "ppdev: Remove usage of the deprecated ida_simple_xx() API" commit which was marked as NO CVE - it's a code cleanup/fix that addresses a programming error but has no security implications.
484f0f59f09ed mfd: exynos-lpass: Fix an error handling path in exynos_lpass_probe()
- [sasha] Let me analyze what I know about this commit:
  Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the leak**: This is a resource leak in an error handling path where `regmap_exit()` was not called if `devm_of_platform_populate()` fails after a successful `regmap_init_mmio()`. The fix switches to using `devm_regmap_init_mmio()` which automatically handles cleanup.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The leak only occurs in the probe failure path, not during normal operation
     - It's a one-time leak that happens only if device probing fails
     - The leaked resource is a regmap structure, which is relatively small
     - This cannot be triggered repeatedly by an attacker since probe only runs once per device
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a simple resource management bug in kernel driver initialization code with no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service potential.
  4. **Comparison to similar commits**:
     - Similar to commit 2 (rt5033) which was marked NO - both fix missing cleanup in error paths by switching to devm_ functions
     - Unlike commit 1 and 4 which were marked YES - those involved more significant resource leaks (ioremap, kzalloc) that could potentially be triggered in ways that impact system resources
  5. **Limited exploitability**: An attacker cannot control when probe fails, and even if they could, the impact would be negligible - a small memory leak during device initialization that cannot accumulate.
  This is a code quality fix that improves error handling but does not address a security vulnerability.
2b1424cd131cf netfs: Fix wait/wake to be consistent about the waitqueue used
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is fixing inconsistencies in the use of waitqueues between `clear_and_wake_up_bit()` and private waitqueue implementations, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. 
  The changes are:
  1. Consolidating wake/wait logic into consistent helper functions (`netfs_wake_rreq_flag`, `netfs_wake_collector`, etc.)
  2. Replacing mixed usage of `clear_and_wake_up_bit()` and direct `wake_up(&rreq->waitq)` calls with a unified approach
  3. Adding proper memory barriers and synchronization
  While this fixes potential race conditions or synchronization issues, there's no evidence of:
  - Memory corruption or buffer overflows
  - Privilege escalation
  - Information disclosure
  - Use-after-free conditions
  - Other exploitable security vulnerabilities
  The commit is a correctness fix for wake/wait synchronization consistency, making the code more maintainable and preventing potential deadlocks or missed wakeups, but these issues don't rise to the level of security vulnerabilities that warrant a CVE assignment.
20d72b00ca814 netfs: Fix the request's work item to not require a ref
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a correctness and reliability fix, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **Race condition management, not security**: The commit addresses a reference counting issue with work items that could lead to incorrect cleanup timing, but this is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit message describes the problem as managing references when queuing work items and potential cleanup happening incorrectly, but doesn't indicate any security implications like memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  3. **Context limitation, not exploitation**: The issue occurs specifically when in BH (Bottom Half) or IRQ context where sleeping is not permitted. This is an architectural constraint handling issue, not an exploitable vulnerability.
  4. **Code changes show refactoring**: The changes primarily involve:
     - Adding a separate `cleanup_work` item to handle deferred cleanup
     - Removing the `was_async` parameter throughout the codebase
     - Changing reference counting from starting at 1 to starting at 2 to account for the IN_PROGRESS flag
  5. **Similar commits marked NO**: The historical similar commits provided show that netfs subsystem fixes for race conditions and reference counting issues have not been assigned CVEs.
  The fix improves the robustness of the netfs subsystem by preventing potential hangs or incorrect cleanup sequences, but does not address an exploitable security vulnerability.
34eb98c6598c4 netfs: Fix setting of transferred bytes with short DIO reads
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
  Let me first understand what the issue is by examining the commit message and code changes:
  **Issue Description:**
  - The bug is in netfs (network filesystem) library's DIO (Direct I/O) read handling
  - When doing a DIO read, the code incorrectly calculates the amount of data transferred
  - Example: Reading 256KiB from a 3-byte file would incorrectly report reading 192KiB (3*64KiB) instead of 3 bytes
  - The root cause is that the collection code was advancing through all subrequests and summing up their positions, rather than stopping at the first short read
  **Code Analysis:**
  The fix modifies `netfs_collect_read_results()` in `fs/netfs/read_collect.c`:
  1. **Key change**: Introduces a new flag `NETFS_RREQ_SHORT_TRANSFER` to track when a short transfer occurs
  2. **Logic change**: Instead of always updating `stream->transferred = stream->collected_to - rreq->start`, it now:
     - Accumulates transfers incrementally: `stream->transferred += transferred`
     - Sets the SHORT_TRANSFER flag when a subrequest transfers less than requested
     - Stops accumulating transfers after the flag is set
  3. **Removed code**: The function `netfs_rreq_assess_dio()` no longer has the loop that was accumulating transfers from all subrequests
  **Security Impact Assessment:**
  This is a **data integrity bug**, not a security vulnerability:
  1. **No privilege escalation**: The bug doesn't allow users to gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges
  2. **No information disclosure**: It doesn't leak sensitive data - it just reports incorrect transfer sizes
  3. **No denial of service**: It doesn't crash the system or make it unavailable
  4. **User-controlled behavior**: The bug only affects the return value of a read() operation that the user themselves initiated
  5. **Limited scope**: Only affects DIO reads in specific scenarios (short reads)
  The bug could potentially cause application misbehavior if programs rely on accurate transfer size reporting, but this is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, none of them received CVE assignments, and they dealt with similar read/transfer handling issues in the netfs subsystem.
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a functional bug that causes incorrect reporting of transferred bytes in DIO read operations, but does not represent a security vulnerability. The issue only affects the accuracy of the return value from read operations and does not enable any unauthorized access, information disclosure, or system compromise. This is a data integrity/correctness issue rather than a security issue.
4481f7f2b3df1 netfs: Fix oops in write-retry from mis-resetting the subreq iterator
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the information provided in the commit message and code changes:
  ## Analysis
  Based on the commit message and code changes, I need to determine if this is a security vulnerability:
  **Key Points from the Commit:**
  1. **Issue Description**: The commit fixes an out-of-bounds read (KASAN detection) in `iov_iter_revert()` during netfs write retry operations.
  2. **Root Cause**: The iterator was being incorrectly reset. The code was using `iov_iter_revert(&source, subreq->len - source.count)` which could cause the iterator to be reverted beyond its bounds when the subrequest had been previously retried and shortened.
  3. **Fix Applied**: The fix replaces the manual revert with a proper iterator reset function `netfs_reset_iter(subreq)`.
  4. **Impact**: The KASAN report shows a "slab-out-of-bounds" read, which is a memory safety issue.
  **Security Implications:**
  1. **Memory Safety Violation**: This is a genuine out-of-bounds read vulnerability detected by KASAN.
  2. **Triggering Conditions**: The vulnerability occurs during write retry operations in the netfs subsystem, specifically when a subrequest has been previously retried and its length has been adjusted.
  3. **Potential Impact**: 
     - Information disclosure (reading beyond allocated memory)
     - Possible system instability or crashes
     - The issue is in kernel space, making it potentially more severe
  4. **Exploitability**: While this appears to be triggerable (syzbot found it), it requires specific conditions during netfs write operations with retries.
  **Comparison with Similar Commits:**
  Looking at the historical commits provided:
  - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed an enomem handling issue with potential memory corruption
  - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Also fixed enomem handling
  - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a read out-of-bounds in ubifs
  This commit shares characteristics with commits that received CVEs, particularly Similar Commit 4 which also fixed an out-of-bounds read.
  **Decision: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a concrete memory safety vulnerability (out-of-bounds read) in kernel space
  2. The vulnerability is triggerable as demonstrated by syzbot
  3. It could lead to information disclosure by reading beyond allocated memory boundaries
  4. The fix addresses a security-relevant bug similar to other commits that received CVEs
  5. The KASAN report clearly shows memory corruption occurring in a kernel subsystem
  The out-of-bounds read in kernel memory represents a security boundary violation that warrants CVE assignment.
5de775df33620 rpmsg: qcom_smd: Fix uninitialized return variable in __qcom_smd_send()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The fix addresses an uninitialized variable issue that could lead to returning uninitialized memory content as an error code. However, this does not constitute a security vulnerability because:
  1. **No sensitive data exposure**: The uninitialized `ret` variable is just a stack variable that would contain random stack data when the function returns. This random value is only used as a return code, not as data that could expose sensitive information.
  2. **Limited impact**: The issue only occurs when the channel state is not `SMD_CHANNEL_OPENED` and the while loop at line 765-786 is never entered. In this case, the function would skip to line 794 and execute the success path, returning an uninitialized value instead of 0.
  3. **API behavior issue, not security**: The bug causes incorrect API behavior (returning random values instead of proper error codes or success), which is a functional bug but not a security vulnerability. Callers would get unpredictable return values, but this doesn't enable any attacks or compromise system security.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the reference commits shown (ath11k and ath12k uninitialized variable fixes) which were also marked as "CVE Status: NO". Those commits also fixed uninitialized return variables that could cause incorrect function behavior but did not pose security risks.
  The fix correctly initializes `ret` to 0, ensuring the function returns a proper success code when it completes without entering the wait loop.
701177511abd2 remoteproc: k3-r5: Refactor sequential core power up/down operations
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a refactoring of the power sequencing mechanism for TI K3 R5F remoteproc cores. The changes move the wait mechanism from the probe routine to the prepare/unprepare functions, addressing a functional issue where probe would fail if firmware wasn't available at boot time.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The commit deals with internal kernel driver logic for coordinating power states between processor cores. There's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service vulnerability being fixed.
  3. **Functional/reliability fix**: The issue being addressed is that the probe routine would fail and remove remoteproc handles from sysfs if firmware wasn't available at boot time. This is a usability/reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Hardware constraint enforcement**: The power sequencing requirements (core0 must power up before core1) are hardware constraints of the PSC controller, not security constraints. Violating these constraints would cause functional failures, not security breaches.
  5. **Similar to commit 3 (NO CVE)**: This commit is similar in nature to "remoteproc: k3-r5: Delay notification of wakeup event" which was also marked as NO CVE - both deal with timing and sequencing of core power-up operations.
  The commit improves the robustness of the driver by allowing probe to succeed even when firmware isn't immediately available, but this doesn't fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
349d62ab207f5 remoteproc: k3-dsp: Drop check performed in k3_dsp_rproc_{mbox_callback/kick}
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the referenced fixes commit, I can now provide my assessment.
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security issue. The commit fixes a race condition where the mailbox callback and kick functions were checking for `RPROC_DETACHED` state, but this check was preventing proper VirtIO RPMsg device initialization during the attach sequence.
  2. **Functional impact only**: The issue causes VirtIO RPMsg devices to fail to probe/initialize properly when attaching to a remote processor in IPC-only mode. This is a functionality problem where communication channels don't work correctly, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security boundaries crossed**: The code changes only affect the timing/ordering of state checks during the remoteproc attach sequence. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Input validation issues
  4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects systems using TI K3 DSP remoteproc in IPC-only mode during the attach operation. It doesn't create any exploitable conditions.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix functional issues in remoteproc subsystems (like mailbox handling, state machine fixes, error path corrections) are generally not assigned CVEs unless they fix actual security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply removes two early return checks that were preventing proper message handling during the transition from `RPROC_DETACHED` to `RPROC_ATTACHED` state, which is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
9995dbfc2235e remoteproc: k3-r5: Drop check performed in k3_r5_rproc_{mbox_callback/kick}
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a race condition where VirtIO RPMsg device probing fails during the attach process because the mailbox callback and kick functions were incorrectly checking for RPROC_DETACHED state.
  2. **Root Cause**: The issue is a logic error in the order of operations during the attach process:
     - `__rproc_attach()` calls `rproc_start_subdevices()` while the state is still RPROC_DETACHED
     - VirtIO RPMsg devices need functional kick/callback handlers during probe
     - The state is only changed to RPROC_ATTACHED after `rproc_start_subdevices()` completes
     - The checks introduced in commit f3f11cfe8907 prevented the callbacks from working during this critical window
  3. **Impact**: The impact is limited to functionality - VirtIO RPMsg devices would fail to probe properly during IPC-only mode attachment. This would prevent communication but does not create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond the intended functionality
  4. **Similar Commits Analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved error handling failures that could lead to crashes or undefined behavior
     - This commit simply removes overly restrictive checks that prevented normal operation
  The commit is a straightforward functional fix that removes incorrect state checks to allow proper device initialization sequencing. There are no security implications from this change.
aea3496bbc7c2 perf tools: Fix arm64 source package build
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context from the kernel tree, here's my CVE assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit is a build system fix that addresses missing files in the perf tools source package MANIFEST. Here's why it doesn't warrant a CVE:
  1. **Build/Packaging Issue Only**: The commit only adds missing files to the MANIFEST file that are needed to build perf tools from the source package. This is purely a build-time issue with no runtime security implications.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The change only modifies `tools/perf/MANIFEST` by adding:
     - `arch/arm64/tools/syscall_64.tbl`
     - `include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild`
     - Various script files needed for the build process
  3. **Context from Referenced Fix**: The referenced commit (bfb713ea53c746b0) was fixing an arm64 build failure caused by changes in how syscall tables are generated. This current commit is just ensuring those necessary files are included in the source package.
  4. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: This is similar to the other build-related commits shown in the examples (like the MANIFEST update for bpf_perf_event.h) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  5. **No Exploitable Vulnerability**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, or any other security vulnerability being fixed. It's simply ensuring that the source package contains all necessary files for building.
  This is a typical build system maintenance commit that ensures the perf tools can be built from the distributed source package, with no security implications whatsoever.
0cb4b1b97041d remoteproc: qcom_wcnss_iris: Add missing put_device() on error in probe
- [sasha] This is a platform driver that runs during boot when the device tree is parsed. The probe function is called when the platform device is registered, which typically happens during system initialization. The error path would only be triggered if:
  1. The device tree node doesn't match
  2. Resources like clocks or regulators are not available
  The leak occurs in the error path of qcom_iris_probe(), which is called from wcnss_probe(). This would typically only happen once during boot if there's a misconfiguration or missing resources.
  **CVE Assessment: NO**
  This is a memory leak in an error path during device initialization, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Limited trigger condition**: The leak only occurs if qcom_iris_probe() fails after device_add() succeeds but before returning. This typically happens during boot-time initialization due to missing resources or configuration errors.
  2. **Not user-controllable**: This is a platform driver probe function that runs during system initialization. It cannot be triggered by unprivileged users or through user-space interfaces.
  3. **One-time occurrence**: The probe function is called once during boot. Even if it fails, it won't be called again unless the system is rebooted.
  4. **Small memory impact**: Only the size of struct qcom_iris (a few dozen bytes) is leaked per occurrence.
  5. **Resource leak, not vulnerability**: This is a coding error that causes a resource leak in an error path, but it doesn't provide any attack vector, privilege escalation opportunity, or way to compromise the system.
  Similar to commit 1 (irqchip/renesas-rzg2l) which also fixed a missing put_device() in an error path and was marked "CVE Status: NO", this is a bug fix for proper resource cleanup, not a security issue.
17e548405a816 perf scripts python: exported-sql-viewer.py: Fix pattern matching with Python 3
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a compatibility fix for Python 3 support in a perf analysis script. Here's why it doesn't warrant a CVE:
  1. **Non-security bug fix**: The change fixes a Python 2 vs Python 3 compatibility issue with the `maketrans()` method. In Python 3, `string.maketrans()` became `str.maketrans()`.
  2. **Analysis/visualization tool**: The `exported-sql-viewer.py` script is a post-processing tool for viewing perf data exported to SQL databases. It's not a core kernel component or security-critical code.
  3. **Pattern matching functionality**: The fix addresses pattern matching for finding symbols in the viewer - a user interface feature that doesn't affect system security.
  4. **No security implications**: The code change simply adds a version check to use the appropriate `maketrans()` method:
     ```python
     if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
         trans = str.maketrans("*?", "%_")
     else:
         trans = string.maketrans("*?", "%_")
     ```
  5. **Similar commits context**: All the similar commits shown (adding utility functions, fixing documentation strings, restoring verbose logging, etc.) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they are all functionality improvements or bug fixes without security implications.
  This is a routine maintenance fix to ensure a perf analysis script works correctly with Python 3, not a security vulnerability fix.
e00eac6b5b6d9 perf intel-pt: Fix PEBS-via-PT data_src
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functionality fix for missing feature support in userspace perf tools, not a security issue. The commit adds support for decoding PEBS-via-PT `data_src` information that was previously not implemented.
  2. **Userspace tool issue**: The changes are entirely in `tools/perf/util/intel-pt.c`, which is part of the userspace perf profiling tool, not kernel code. The issue only affects the accuracy of performance monitoring data display.
  3. **No security impact**: The commit fixes incorrect output display (showing "N/A" values instead of proper memory access information). This is a quality/correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The "Before" and "After" examples in the commit message show it's just fixing data presentation:
     - Before: `0 |OP No|LVL N/A|SNP N/A|TLB N/A|LCK No|BLK N/A`
     - After: `10268100142 |OP LOAD|LVL L1 hit|SNP None|TLB L1 or L2 hit|LCK No|BLK N/A`
  4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The fix doesn't address any unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise scenarios.
  5. **Feature completion, not security fix**: The original commit (975846eddf907297) explicitly stated it didn't add `PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC` support. This commit is simply completing that missing functionality.
  Unlike the kernel segfault fix referenced in the similar commits (99bcd91fabad), which could potentially be exploited for denial of service, this commit is purely a userspace tool enhancement for proper data decoding.
4bfe27140edf8 perf tests: Fix 'perf report' tests installation
- [sasha] Now let me understand the nature of this fix by looking at the commit changes more carefully:
  Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my CVE assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a build system bug fix that corrects a copy-paste error in the Makefile. The analysis shows:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is a simple copy-paste mistake where `tests/shell/base_probe/*.sh` was being incorrectly installed into the `base_report` directory instead of `tests/shell/base_report/*.sh`. This is purely a build/installation error.
  2. **Security impact**: There is no security vulnerability here. The bug only affects the test suite installation process during `make install-tests`. It doesn't introduce any:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Code execution vulnerabilities
  3. **Code changes**: The fix simply corrects the source path from `base_probe` to `base_report` and adds installation of `.txt` files (specifically `stderr-whitelist.txt`) that are needed for the tests to run properly.
  4. **Functionality affected**: This only impacts developers or testers who are installing the perf test suite. It doesn't affect the actual perf tool functionality or introduce any security risks to end users.
  This is a standard build system fix similar to the other "NO CVE" examples provided, which also fixed test-related issues without security implications.
30d20fb1f84ad perf trace: Fix leaks of 'struct thread' in set_filter_loop_pids()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes memory leaks in the perf tool's userspace code, specifically in the `set_filter_loop_pids()` function. The issue is that `machine__find_thread()` returns a thread with an incremented reference count (as noted in the comment "Caller must eventually drop thread->refcnt"), but the original code was not properly releasing these references with `thread__put()`.
  Key points:
  1. This is a userspace tool issue in `tools/perf/`, not a kernel vulnerability
  2. The leak only affects the perf tool's memory usage during execution, not kernel memory
  3. No security boundaries are crossed - it's just improper reference counting in a diagnostic tool
  4. The impact is limited to potential memory exhaustion of the perf process itself when using `perf trace -a`
  This is a standard resource leak bug fix in userspace tooling that doesn't pose any security risk to the system. CVEs are not assigned for memory leaks in userspace diagnostic tools that don't have security implications.
bb3de7fa988c1 perf trace: Fix leaks of 'struct thread' in fprintf_sys_enter()
- [sasha] Perfect! The comment confirms that the caller must drop the reference count. 
  Now let's analyze the issue in the patched code:
  **BEFORE THE PATCH:**
  ```c
  thread = machine__findnew_thread(trace->host, sample->pid, sample->tid);
  e_machine = thread__e_machine(thread, trace->host);
  sc = trace__syscall_info(trace, evsel, e_machine, id);
  if (sc == NULL)
      return -1;  // <-- LEAK HERE: thread reference not dropped
  ```
  **AFTER THE PATCH:**
  ```c
  thread = machine__findnew_thread(trace->host, sample->pid, sample->tid);
  e_machine = thread__e_machine(thread, trace->host);
  sc = trace__syscall_info(trace, evsel, e_machine, id);
  if (sc == NULL)
      goto out_put;  // <-- FIXED: jumps to thread__put(thread)
  ```
  The fix ensures that the thread reference is properly dropped in the error path.
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Resource leak, not a security vulnerability**: The bug is a memory/reference leak in the perf tool's userspace code. When `trace__syscall_info()` returns NULL, the function was returning early without dropping the reference count on the thread object obtained from `machine__findnew_thread()`.
  2. **No security impact**: This is a resource management bug in a diagnostic/profiling tool (perf). Memory leaks in userspace tools, while bugs that should be fixed, do not constitute security vulnerabilities unless they can be exploited to cause denial of service or other security impacts.
  3. **Limited scope**: The leak only occurs in a specific error path in the `trace__fprintf_sys_enter()` function when syscall info cannot be found. This is a quality issue rather than a security issue.
  4. **Userspace tool**: This code is in the perf userspace tool (`tools/perf/`), not in the kernel itself. Memory leaks in userspace diagnostic tools are generally not considered security vulnerabilities.
  The similar commits analyzed also show patterns of fixing issues in perf tool without CVE assignments - they fixed uninitialized memory reads, thread lifecycle management, and memory leaks, none of which received CVE assignments because they don't represent exploitable security vulnerabilities.
13e79076c89f6 dm-flakey: make corrupting read bios work
- [sasha] Perfect! The code clearly states "Used for testing only, simulates intermittent, catastrophic device failure."
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE. It fixes a functionality bug in dm-flakey's corrupt_bio_byte feature for read operations. dm-flakey is explicitly a testing-only driver designed to simulate device failures and data corruption for debugging purposes (as stated in line 25: "Used for testing only"). The bug prevented the intentional data corruption feature from working correctly on read operations - it was checking bio_has_data() in the endio function where no data remained. The fix saves the bio iterator during mapping and uses it later for corruption. This is purely a bug fix to make a testing feature work as intended, with no security implications.
40ed054f39bc9 dm-flakey: error all IOs when num_features is absent
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The bug is in dm-flakey, which is a **testing tool** designed to simulate failing devices. According to the documentation (dm-flakey.rst:6-7), it's "found useful in simulating failing devices for testing purposes."
  2. **The specific issue**: When `num_features` parameter was absent (not specified at all), dm-flakey would never error any I/O, contrary to its documented behavior. When `num_features` was set to 0, it would error all I/Os as expected. The fix makes both cases consistent.
  3. **Code analysis**: The fix changes:
     - `int r;` → `int r = 0;`
     - `unsigned int argc;` → `unsigned int argc = 0;`
     - Restructures the logic to handle the case when `as->argc` is 0 (no arguments) by jumping to `error_all_io:` label
  4. **No security impact**: 
     - This is a testing/debugging tool, not a production data path component
     - The bug causes the tool to be **less** disruptive (not erroring I/Os when it should), not more
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure
     - It's simply a functional correctness issue in a testing utility
  5. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits with CVE status "YES" involved:
     - Memory corruption (dm-flakey bio_init fix)
     - NULL pointer dereferences (dm stats alloc_percpu failure)
     - Actual security vulnerabilities in production code paths
  This is just a bug fix for incorrect behavior in a testing tool that made it fail to inject errors when expected.
121218bef4c1d dm: limit swapping tables for devices with zone write plugs
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Memory Safety Vulnerability**: The issue fixed involves out-of-bounds memory access in `bdev_zone_is_seq()` when reading `disk->conv_zones_bitmap` with the wrong size. This is a classic memory safety vulnerability that can lead to information disclosure or system crashes.
  2. **Buffer Size Mismatch**: The core issue is that when swapping device mapper tables for zoned devices with existing zone write plug resources, the bitmap sizes become inconsistent with the actual device configuration. This can cause bitmap operations to read/write beyond allocated bounds.
  3. **Exploitable Condition**: While requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges limits the attack surface, the vulnerability still poses security risks:
     - Information disclosure through controlled out-of-bounds reads
     - Potential for kernel crashes (DoS)
     - Could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned Issues**: Looking at the similar commits, commit 3 (RCU protect disk->conv_zones_bitmap) was assigned a CVE for protecting against invalid memory references when using the same bitmap. This commit fixes a related memory safety issue with the same data structure.
  5. **Clear Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states "bdev_zone_is_seq() reading invalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size" - this is a textbook memory safety vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
  The fix properly prevents the vulnerable condition by disallowing table swaps that would create inconsistent zone management state, addressing the root cause of the memory safety issue.
37f53a2c60d03 dm: fix dm_blk_report_zones
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and related code, here's my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a **use-after-free vulnerability** that can be triggered by unprivileged users through normal system calls.
  Key security-relevant aspects:
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states "If blk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while the other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error."
  2. **Triggerable by Unprivileged Users**: The vulnerability can be triggered through the `blkdev_report_zones_ioctl()` system call, which is accessible to users with access to the block device. The commit states "it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by blkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones()."
  3. **Race Condition**: The fix addresses multiple race conditions:
     - Missing `dm_put_live_table()` call when `dm_get_live_table()` returns NULL (resource leak)
     - Race between reading `md->zone_revalidate_map` multiple times
     - Race between zone revalidation and concurrent zone reporting operations
  4. **Memory Safety Impact**: The vulnerability involves accessing freed memory, which could potentially lead to:
     - Information disclosure (reading freed memory)
     - System crashes
     - Potentially code execution depending on what gets allocated in the freed memory
  5. **Similar to Previous CVEs**: Looking at the similar commits, the commit "dm: fix use-after-free in dm_cleanup_zoned_dev()" was assigned a CVE, and this commit fixes a similar class of use-after-free vulnerability in the same subsystem.
  The fix adds proper synchronization by:
  - Reading `zone_revalidate_map` only once to prevent TOCTOU issues
  - Tracking the process that sets the revalidate map with `revalidate_map_task`
  - Ensuring proper cleanup with `dm_put_live_table()` in all code paths
  This represents a real security vulnerability that could be exploited by local users with access to zoned block devices.
fa9c4977fbfbc perf symbol-minimal: Fix double free in filename__read_build_id
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Tool Location**: This code is in `tools/perf/util/symbol-minimal.c`, which is part of the perf userspace tool, not the kernel itself. CVEs for kernel commits typically focus on kernel-space vulnerabilities.
  2. **Bug Nature**: While this is a double-free bug caught by AddressSanitizer, it occurs in the perf tool when parsing ELF files. The specific issue is that when `phdr->p_filesz` is 0, `realloc(buf, 0)` returns NULL (which is equivalent to free), and then the error path tries to free the buffer again at line 221.
  3. **Attack Surface**: The perf tool typically:
     - Runs with elevated privileges when doing system-wide profiling
     - Parses ELF files from the local filesystem
     - Is not exposed to untrusted network input
     - Requires local access to exploit
  4. **Impact**: The bug causes a crash in the perf tool itself, not a kernel crash or privilege escalation. An attacker would need:
     - Local access to the system
     - Ability to place a malformed ELF file
     - Convince a user to run perf on that file
  5. **Similar Commits**: All the referenced similar commits (with CVE Status: NO) are also perf tool fixes dealing with memory management issues, build problems, and test fixes - none were assigned CVEs.
  While this is a legitimate bug fix for a memory management issue, it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment because it's in a userspace development tool with limited attack surface and impact.
25be318324563 hwmon: (asus-ec-sensors) check sensor index in read_string()
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Memory Safety Vulnerability**: The code has a clear out-of-bounds array access vulnerability. In `asus_ec_hwmon_read_string()`, when `find_ec_sensor_index()` returns a negative value (e.g., -ENOENT), this negative value is passed directly to `get_sensor_info()` which uses it as an array index in `state->sensors[index].info_index`.
  2. **Attack Vector**: This vulnerability is triggered through the hwmon sysfs interface when reading sensor label attributes. An unprivileged local user can trigger this by reading from hwmon sysfs files (typically readable by all users).
  3. **Impact**: The negative array index leads to accessing memory before the allocated array, potentially causing:
     - Information disclosure (reading kernel memory)
     - Kernel crash/DoS
     - Potentially arbitrary code execution depending on memory layout
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits that were assigned CVEs:
     - Like commit "hwmon: (ltc2991) re-order conditions to fix off by one bug" - both fix array bounds checking
     - Like commit "hwmon: (asus-ec-sensors) Add checks for devm_kcalloc" - both fix missing error checking that could lead to invalid memory access
  5. **Real-world exposure**: The asus-ec-sensors driver is used on popular ASUS motherboards, making this a practical vulnerability affecting real systems.
  The fix properly checks if `sensor_index` is negative before using it, preventing the out-of-bounds access.
d95846350aac7 mtd: nand: ecc-mxic: Fix use of uninitialized variable ret
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a code quality fix for an uninitialized variable that could lead to undefined behavior, but it does not represent a security vulnerability. The uninitialized variable `ret` is only used in error paths and does not lead to exploitable conditions.
  2. **Limited impact**: Looking at the code flow:
     - If `ctx->steps` is 0, the loop at line 639 is skipped
     - The uninitialized `ret` would then be checked at line 653
     - This could return garbage values, but doesn't expose sensitive data or allow privilege escalation
  3. **Theoretical edge case**: The commit message mentions this requires "misconfigured geometry, ECC engine misuse" - these are configuration errors, not attack vectors. The `steps` calculation (line 267) is `mtd->writesize / SZ_1K`, which would only be 0 if `mtd->writesize` is less than 1KB, which is checked earlier in the initialization.
  4. **Similar commits comparison**: All the similar commits provided (imx214, onenand, regmap, ath12k, ath11k) were marked as "CVE Status: NO". They all fix uninitialized variables but were not assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Nature of the fix**: The fix simply initializes `ret = 0`, which is a defensive programming practice to ensure predictable behavior. The worst case scenario is returning incorrect error status, not a security breach.
  This is a standard bug fix for code correctness, not a security vulnerability fix.
ccd4b5cdf00f3 perf tests metric-only perf stat: Fix tests 84 and 86 s390
- [sasha] Let me examine the actual diff more carefully from the provided information. Looking at the changes:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a test case fix for the perf tool's test suite on s390 architecture. The changes only modify test scripts in `tools/perf/tests/shell/` directory.
  2. **What it fixes**: The commit addresses test failures on s390x KVM and z/VM machines where the CPU Measurement Facility is not available. It adds a check to skip certain tests when the facility is not present:
     ```bash
     if [ "$(uname -m)" = "s390x" ] && ! grep '^facilities' /proc/cpuinfo  | grep -qw 67
     then
         echo "[Skip] CPU-measurement counter facility not installed"
         return
     fi
     ```
  3. **No security impact**: 
     - The changes only affect test execution behavior
     - No actual perf functionality is modified
     - No memory management, access control, or input validation issues are fixed
     - The original issue was simply test failures due to unavailable hardware features
  4. **Scope**: This is purely a test infrastructure improvement to handle hardware capability detection properly on s390 platforms.
  The commit is similar to the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" - it's a fix for test infrastructure to handle platform-specific limitations properly, with no security implications whatsoever.
68cb1567439fa perf tool_pmu: Fix aggregation on duration_time
- [sasha] Let me understand what the fix is about by looking at the commit message details:
  Based on the commit message and code changes, this fix addresses a bug in the perf tool where:
  1. The `duration_time` event was setting `ena` and `run` counters to 0 when `cpu_map_idx != 0`
  2. This caused `evsel__count_has_error()` to fail counters when enabled or running time are 0
  3. The fix changes:
     - `count->ena = count->run = delta_start;` 
     - to: `count->ena++; count->run++;`
  The change ensures that the enabled and running time always have a non-zero value to maintain a 100% ratio, preventing the error condition.
  **NO**, this should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a functional bug fix in the perf userspace tool that affects metric calculation and display, not a security vulnerability. The issue:
  - Only impacts performance monitoring/statistics display
  - Does not involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  - Cannot be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code
  - Is purely a calculation/display issue in a userspace diagnostic tool
  The fix simply ensures proper aggregation of performance metrics by maintaining non-zero counter values to avoid triggering error conditions in the tool's internal validation logic.
600e9606046ac x86/irq: Ensure initial PIR loads are performed exactly once
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **The change is a correctness/reliability fix, not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit ensures that PIR (Posted Interrupt Request) loads are performed exactly once using `READ_ONCE()` instead of a plain read. This prevents potential compiler optimizations that could reload the value.
  2. **No security impact described**: The commit message explicitly states that "functionally, a reload is benign" - meaning even if the issue occurs, it doesn't cause security problems. It would only "defeat the purpose of pre-loading into a copy" which is a performance optimization.
  3. **Performance optimization context**: The entire posted MSI feature is about improving interrupt handling performance by coalescing notifications. The code comment clearly indicates this is on the "performance path" and is about cache optimization.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: The change from `pir[i]` to `READ_ONCE(pir[i])` prevents the compiler from potentially reloading the value between the initial read and subsequent use, but this doesn't create any security vulnerability - it just ensures the intended optimization works correctly.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the "irqchip/sifive-plic: Chain to parent IRQ after handlers are ready" commit which fixed a race condition but was marked as NO CVE, as it was about proper initialization ordering rather than a security issue.
  The fix is about ensuring code correctness and maintaining the intended performance optimization behavior, not addressing any security vulnerability.
de7ad66b16b4d HID: HID_APPLETB_BL should depend on X86
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability fixed**: This is a build configuration improvement that adds an architecture dependency (`depends on X86 || COMPILE_TEST`) to prevent the driver from being offered during kernel configuration on non-x86 architectures.
  2. **No functional code changes**: The commit only modifies the Kconfig file to add a dependency constraint. It doesn't change any driver code, fix any security bugs, or address any vulnerabilities.
  3. **Cosmetic/usability fix**: The change is purely to improve the user experience during kernel configuration by not presenting an irrelevant driver option on architectures where the hardware (Apple Touch Bar on x86 MacBooks) cannot exist.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (adding device IDs, fixing backlights, adding quirks), none were assigned CVEs because they don't fix security vulnerabilities.
  5. **COMPILE_TEST allowance**: The addition of `|| COMPILE_TEST` explicitly allows the driver to still be built on non-x86 architectures for testing purposes, showing this is about configuration clarity rather than preventing any security issue.
  This is a standard kernel configuration improvement that enhances the build system's user experience but has no security implications whatsoever.
2a647d400afec HID: HID_APPLETB_KBD should depend on X86
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change adds a single line `depends on X86 || COMPILE_TEST` to the Kconfig file, which is purely a build configuration constraint. This:
  1. **Does not fix any security vulnerability** - It simply prevents the driver from being offered as a configuration option on non-X86 architectures
  2. **Has no security implications** - The driver was already specific to x86 MacBook Pros (as stated in the help text), this just enforces that constraint at build time
  3. **Is a usability/configuration improvement** - It prevents users from unnecessarily being prompted about this driver when building kernels for non-X86 architectures
  4. **Similar to the reference commits** - Like the similar commits shown (adding device IDs, backlight support), this is a hardware support/configuration change with no security impact
  The commit is fixing a configuration issue identified by the Fixes tag, but it's not addressing any security vulnerability that could be exploited.
37d66cf078719 HID: intel-thc-hid: intel-quicki2c: pass correct arguments to acpi_evaluate_object
- [sasha] Now I have a better understanding of the issues. Let me analyze the specific commit in question:
  **CVE Analysis Decision: NO**
  **Explanation:**
  This commit fixes an incorrect ACPI API usage issue, not a security vulnerability. The changes made:
  1. **API Misuse Fix**: The code was incorrectly passing an argument list to `acpi_evaluate_object()` when querying ACPI DSD (Device Specific Data) properties ICRS and ISUB. These are static ACPI buffer objects, not methods, so they don't accept arguments.
  2. **Functional Impact**: The bug would cause ACPI evaluation errors (as shown in the log messages), but would not lead to security issues:
     - The function would fail with `-ENODEV` when ACPI evaluation fails
     - The error is properly handled and propagated up the call chain
     - No memory corruption or data leakage occurs from this specific bug
  3. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: This is a driver initialization issue that would prevent the device from working properly, but doesn't expose any security vulnerabilities:
     - The incorrect API call would simply fail
     - No untrusted data is involved
     - No privilege escalation possible
     - No information disclosure
  4. **Related Issues**: While there was a separate memory corruption issue fixed in commit d08a1049659a (using u32 instead of u16 for ACPI integer values), the current commit under review only addresses the API usage issue.
  This is similar to the "CVE Status: NO" commits shown in the examples, particularly similar to commit #1 which also fixed a build/configuration issue without security implications.
e12d3e1624a02 backlight: pm8941: Add NULL check in wled_configure()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my conclusion:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that occurs when `devm_kasprintf()` fails to allocate memory and returns NULL. Without the fix, this NULL value is passed to `backlight_device_register()`, which dereferences it in multiple places:
     - `pr_debug("backlight_device_register: name=%s\n", name);`
     - `dev_set_name(&new_bd->dev, "%s", name);`
     - `WARN(1, "%s: invalid backlight type", name);`
  2. **Security Impact**: This vulnerability can cause a kernel panic/crash when memory allocation fails during the backlight driver initialization. This could be triggered under memory pressure conditions.
  3. **Pattern Matches Similar CVEs**: The commit follows the exact same pattern as the similar commits shown that were assigned CVEs:
     - It adds a NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()`
     - It returns -ENOMEM on failure
     - The commit message explicitly mentions preventing "NULL pointer dereference"
     - It has a proper Fixes: tag indicating a security-relevant issue
  4. **Driver Characteristics**: The BACKLIGHT_QCOM_WLED driver is configured as tristate, meaning it can be built as a module and loaded/unloaded, potentially making it easier to trigger the vulnerability through repeated module loading under memory pressure.
  The vulnerability is a classic NULL pointer dereference in kernel space that can lead to system crashes, which warrants CVE assignment.
4ea30ec6fb3bb dm: handle failures in dm_table_set_restrictions
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications. Based on the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a correctness fix for error handling, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit ensures that when `dm_table_set_restrictions()` fails, the device mapper properly reverts to the previous state instead of potentially using mismatched settings.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The code changes only affect internal state management during table swapping operations. There's no:
     - Memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Input validation issues
  3. **Impact analysis**: The issue being fixed could lead to inconsistent device configuration states (using old table with new settings), but this is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The worst case would be incorrect device behavior, not a security compromise.
  4. **Code changes examination**:
     - Saves old queue limits before update (`old_limits = queue_limits_start_update(q)`)
     - Restores them on failure (`queue_limits_set(q, &old_limits)`)
     - Defers setting of DAX and zone settings until after success is guaranteed
     - Introduces `dm_finalize_zone_settings()` to properly sequence state updates
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This commit is similar to commit 1 in the reference list ("dm: Call dm_revalidate_zones() after setting the queue limits") which was marked as NO CVE - both deal with proper ordering and state management in device mapper without security implications.
  The changes are purely about maintaining consistency in device mapper's internal state during configuration changes, which is a reliability/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
e8819e7f03470 dm: free table mempools if not used in __bind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Reasoning:**
  1. **Resource leak, not a security vulnerability**: This is a memory leak that occurs when device-mapper tables are reloaded while using request-based DM. While it's a bug that wastes memory, it doesn't create a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossing**: The leak doesn't allow:
     - Unauthorized access to memory
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - System compromise
     - Denial of service beyond gradual memory consumption
  3. **Limited impact and exploitation difficulty**:
     - Requires administrative privileges to trigger (table reloads require CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
     - The leak is gradual and predictable
     - Only affects request-based device-mapper configurations
     - Memory can be reclaimed by removing the device
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Unlike the CVE-assigned commits shown (memory corruption, NULL pointer dereferences, race conditions), this is just improper cleanup
     - The CVE examples involved crashes, data corruption, or exploitable conditions
     - This commit simply fixes a resource leak with no security impact
  5. **Nature of the fix**: The fix is straightforward resource management - properly freeing unused memory. It doesn't address any security-sensitive behavior or prevent any attacks.
  This is a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The memory leak could eventually impact system performance if many table reloads occur, but it doesn't create an exploitable condition or violate any security properties of the system.
9eb7109a5bfc5 dm: don't change md if dm_table_set_restrictions() fails
- [sasha] Now let me understand the security implications. The commit fixes a situation where:
  1. The device capacity could be changed to a new (potentially larger) value
  2. But the actual mapping table remains the old one
  3. This creates a mismatch where the reported device size doesn't match the actual mappings
  This could lead to:
  - Out-of-bounds access if the new capacity is larger than what the old table can handle
  - Memory corruption if the wrong mempools are used with the old table
  - Data corruption or crashes when I/O operations reference areas beyond the actual mapped regions
  Let me check similar commits to compare:
  Looking at the similar commits:
  - Commit 1 (CVE: YES): Fixed a crash due to NULL pointer dereference when accessing md->disk
  - Commit 3 (CVE: YES): Same as commit 1, just the stable backport
  - Commit 5 (CVE: YES): Fixed out-of-bounds access in dm cache
  This commit prevents a potential state inconsistency that could lead to out-of-bounds access or crashes when the device capacity doesn't match the actual table mappings.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a security vulnerability where a failed dm_table_set_restrictions() call would leave the device in an inconsistent state with mismatched capacity and mempools. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, crashes, or data corruption when I/O operations are performed on regions that are within the reported device capacity but outside the actual mapped regions of the old table. The fix ensures atomicity by validating restrictions before making any persistent changes to the device state.
1741189d843a1 perf ui browser hists: Set actions->thread before calling do_zoom_thread()
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze this:
  **NO**
  This commit is a bug fix for a UI functionality issue in the perf tool (performance analysis tool) that does not represent a security vulnerability.
  The issue is:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: When using ESC or left arrow to zoom out of a thread view in the perf UI browser, the `actions->thread` was not being set before calling `do_zoom_thread()`, causing the UI to get stuck in thread zoom mode.
  2. **Code analysis**: The fix simply adds one line `actions->thread = thread;` before calling `do_zoom_thread(browser, actions);` at line 3280. This ensures the thread parameter is properly set.
  3. **Impact**: This is purely a UI navigation bug where users couldn't properly zoom out of thread view using ESC/left arrow keys. They could still work around it by using the 't' hotkey. There is no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service (beyond UI inconvenience)
     - Security boundary violation
  4. **Component affected**: The perf tool runs in userspace for performance analysis and profiling. This particular code is in the TUI (text user interface) browser component that displays performance data interactively.
  This is a functional bug fix that improves user experience but has no security implications worthy of a CVE assignment.
e0eb84cd51808 tools build: Don't show libbfd build status as it is opt-in
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the change**: This commit only modifies build system display output. It removes `libbfd` and `libbfd-buildid` from the `FEATURE_DISPLAY` list in `tools/build/Makefile.feature`. This is purely a cosmetic change that affects what features are shown during the build process.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes are limited to:
     - Removing two lines from a display list in a Makefile
     - This only affects what information is printed to the console during build
     - It does not change any actual functionality, compilation behavior, or runtime behavior
  3. **Context from commit message**: The commit explicitly states it's removing distraction from the build output since libbfd is now opt-in (requires `BUILD_NONDISTRO=1`) due to license incompatibility issues. Users can still check the feature status with `perf check feature libbfd`.
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked as "CVE Status: NO"), they also involve build system changes and feature detection modifications without security implications.
  5. **Code changes**: The diff shows only the removal of two feature names from a display list - no executable code, no access control changes, no memory handling modifications, or any other security-relevant patterns.
  This is a quality-of-life improvement for the build system that reduces noise in the output, with zero security implications.
4fce4b91fd1aa perf build: Warn when libdebuginfod devel files are not available
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Build-time only change**: The commit only adds a warning message during the build process when debuginfod development files are not found. The actual change is just adding an `else` clause with a `$(warning ...)` statement in the Makefile.
  2. **No security vulnerability introduced or fixed**: The commit doesn't fix any security vulnerability. It simply improves the build experience by informing developers when an optional feature (debuginfod support) is missing its development headers.
  3. **Cosmetic/informational change**: The change is purely informational - it adds a warning message to help developers understand why debuginfod support wasn't enabled during the build. The warning message is:
     ```
     $(warning No elfutils/debuginfod.h found, no debuginfo server support, please install libdebuginfod-dev/elfutils-debuginfod-client-devel or equivalent)
     ```
  4. **No runtime impact**: This doesn't affect the runtime behavior of perf in any way. It only affects what messages are displayed during compilation.
  5. **Similar to other feature warnings**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, none of them received CVEs, and they all involve build system improvements, feature detection, or warning messages - not security fixes.
  The commit is labeled with `Fixes: c7a14fdcb3fa7736` but this is just indicating it improves upon a previous commit that added debuginfod support, not that it fixes a security issue.
a3a4039129227 tools build: Don't show libunwind build status as it is opt-in
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is purely cosmetic and only affects build output display:
  1. **No security impact**: This commit only removes `libunwind` from the `FEATURE_DISPLAY` list in `tools/build/Makefile.feature`. This variable only controls what features are shown in the build status output - it has no impact on actual functionality or security.
  2. **Build display only**: The commit message clearly states this is about not showing libunwind build status to avoid "distraction" since it's now opt-in by default. The actual libunwind functionality remains unchanged.
  3. **Similar commits pattern**: All 5 similar commits dealing with build system changes, libunwind configuration, and feature detection are marked as "CVE Status: NO", establishing a clear pattern that build system display changes don't warrant CVEs.
  4. **Nature of change**: The diff shows only one line being removed from `FEATURE_DISPLAY` list. This doesn't affect:
     - Any runtime behavior
     - Security boundaries
     - Access controls
     - Memory safety
     - Data validation
  This is a purely cosmetic build system change to improve user experience by not showing confusing "OFF" status for a feature that is now opt-in by default.
6559b83e4e71b tools build: Don't set libunwind as available if test-all.c build succeeds
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit in detail:
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a build system fix for the perf tools, specifically fixing an issue where libunwind was incorrectly being detected as available when test-all.c built successfully, even though it was meant to be opt-in.
  2. **What it fixes**: The commit addresses a build configuration issue where:
     - libunwind was removed from test-all.c (made opt-in) in a previous commit
     - But the build system still marked it as available when test-all.c built successfully
     - This caused confusion about whether libunwind support was actually enabled
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - In `tools/build/Makefile.feature`: Removes `libunwind` from the `FEATURE_TESTS_BASIC` list
     - In `tools/perf/Makefile.config`: Adds explicit `feature_check` for libunwind and improves error messaging
  4. **No security implications**: 
     - This is purely a build system configuration fix
     - It doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control issues
     - It doesn't affect the runtime behavior or security of the perf tool
     - It only ensures the build system correctly detects and reports libunwind availability
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is similar in nature to the reference commits provided (commits 1-5), which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO". They all deal with build system improvements, feature detection, and configuration management rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is fixing a build system inconsistency introduced by commit 13e17c9ff49119aa ("perf build: Make libunwind opt-in rather than opt-out"), not a security vulnerability.
f39f18f3c3531 randstruct: gcc-plugin: Fix attribute addition
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning based on the code analysis:
  1. **Build-time issue, not runtime vulnerability**: The commit fixes an internal compiler error that occurs during kernel compilation with GCC 15. The error message shows "internal compiler error: in comptypes_check_enum_int" - this prevents the kernel from building but doesn't introduce a security vulnerability in running systems.
  2. **Code changes are purely structural**: The changes in `gcc-common.h` add helper functions (`__add_type_attr` and `add_type_attr`) that properly manage type attributes across type variants. The changes in `randomize_layout_plugin.c` replace direct attribute manipulation with calls to these new helper functions. These are compile-time metadata management fixes.
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug doesn't allow attackers to bypass security controls, execute arbitrary code, or gain elevated privileges. It's a compatibility fix that ensures the randstruct security feature can continue to work with newer GCC versions.
  4. **Similar to historical non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they show a pattern of build system and compatibility fixes (GCC version checks, grammar fixes, compiler attributes) that were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  While the randstruct feature itself is security-related (it randomizes structure layouts to make exploitation harder), this particular fix addresses a build-time compatibility issue rather than a security vulnerability. The worst impact is that users with GCC 15 would need to disable randstruct or use an older compiler - inconvenient but not a direct security risk.
e136a4062174a randstruct: gcc-plugin: Remove bogus void member
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit removes a redundant safety mechanism (the bogus void member) that was designed to catch non-designated initializers at compile time. The commit message explicitly states this is a "redundant safety measure" because the same protection is already provided by the `__designated_initializer` attribute enforced by `-Wdesignated-init`.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The issue being fixed is a **false positive** compiler internal error that occurs during legitimate code compilation. The Landlock code that triggered this issue was doing a valid struct copy between identical struct types with identical layouts.
  3. **Build/compilation issue only**: This fixes a compile-time issue where GCC's `count_type_elements` function would hit an assertion failure when encountering the void member during certain initialization patterns. This is a build problem, not a runtime security issue.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: The commit message and code changes show this is purely about removing an overly aggressive compile-time check that was causing legitimate code to fail compilation. There's no indication of any exploitable vulnerability being fixed.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they show patterns of:
     - Compiler warning fixes (similar commit 1: avoiding gcc complaint about pointer casting)
     - Build compatibility fixes (similar commits 4 & 5: fixing __counted_by compatibility issues)
     - Code cleanup and modernization (similar commit 1: replacing zero-length arrays)
  The randstruct plugin itself is a security hardening feature, but this commit doesn't fix a vulnerability in that feature - it removes an unnecessary compile-time check that was causing false positives.
a4e2401438a26 watchdog: lenovo_se30_wdt: Fix possible devm_ioremap() NULL pointer dereference in lenovo_se30_wdt_probe()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The original code calls `devm_ioremap()` but doesn't check if it returns NULL. If the ioremap fails (which can happen due to memory allocation failure or invalid physical address mapping), `priv->shm_base_addr` will be NULL.
  2. **Exploitable Path**: After the probe function completes successfully (line 293), the watchdog device is registered. When userspace interacts with the watchdog device through its operations (start, stop, ping, get_timeleft), these functions will dereference the NULL `shm_base_addr`:
     - `lenovo_se30_wdt_start()` → `lenovo_se30_wdt_enable()` → `write_shm_win()` → `iowrite8()` on NULL pointer
     - `lenovo_se30_wdt_stop()` → `lenovo_se30_wdt_enable()` → `write_shm_win()` → `iowrite8()` on NULL pointer
     - `lenovo_se30_wdt_ping()` → `write_shm_win()` → `iowrite8()` on NULL pointer
     - `lenovo_se30_wdt_get_timeleft()` → `read_shm_win()` → `ioread8()` on NULL pointer
  3. **Security Impact**: This creates a kernel NULL pointer dereference that can be triggered from userspace by any process with access to the watchdog device (typically `/dev/watchdog`). This could lead to:
     - Kernel panic/crash (DoS)
     - Potential privilege escalation on systems without proper NULL pointer protection
  4. **Similar CVE Precedents**: Looking at the similar commits:
     - Commit 2 (pata_pxa) with the same pattern (missing NULL check after devm_ioremap) was assigned a CVE
     - Commit 4 (also pata_pxa) with identical issue was assigned a CVE
     - These establish a clear precedent that missing NULL checks after devm_ioremap() leading to NULL pointer dereferences warrant CVE assignment
  5. **Trigger Conditions**: The vulnerability can be triggered when:
     - Memory allocation fails during ioremap
     - The physical address range cannot be mapped
     - The system is under memory pressure
  The fix correctly adds the NULL check after `devm_ioremap()` and returns `-ENOMEM`, preventing the NULL pointer from being stored and later dereferenced.
3f6dae09fc8c3 fbdev: core: fbcvt: avoid division by 0 in fb_cvt_hperiod()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination on whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability - specifically a division by zero that can cause a kernel oops (crash). Here's why this warrants a CVE:
  1. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability is reachable from userspace through the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO ioctl, which allows unprivileged users to set video mode parameters including the refresh rate.
  2. **Specific Vulnerability**: When `mode->refresh` is set to 0x80000000 (2^31), the multiplication on line 331 (`cvt.f_refresh *= 2`) causes an integer overflow, resulting in `cvt.f_refresh` becoming 0. This zero value is then used as a divisor in `fb_cvt_hperiod()` at line 75 (`u32 num = 1000000000/cvt->f_refresh;`), causing a division by zero and kernel crash.
  3. **Impact**: This allows local unprivileged users to crash the kernel (DoS), which is a security issue. The commit message explicitly states "division by 0 will result in kernel oops."
  4. **Similar CVEs**: The similar commits shown all received CVEs for similar division-by-zero issues in fbdev drivers (CVE-2022-3061 is specifically mentioned in one commit).
  5. **Exploitability**: The vulnerability can be triggered by userspace through standard ioctl calls with crafted parameters, making it easily exploitable by local users.
  The fix adds a bounds check (`cvt.f_refresh > INT_MAX`) to prevent the overflow that leads to the division by zero, properly mitigating the security vulnerability.
d6a0e0bfecccd ubsan: integer-overflow: depend on BROKEN to keep this out of CI
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This commit adds `depends on BROKEN` to the `UBSAN_INTEGER_WRAP` config option. The BROKEN dependency is a kernel configuration mechanism used to hide experimental or incomplete features from regular users.
  2. **Not fixing a vulnerability**: The commit is not fixing any security vulnerability. It's actually making an experimental feature harder to enable by requiring BROKEN to be set, which prevents it from being accidentally enabled in CI/randconfig builds.
  3. **Preventive measure**: As stated in the commit message, this is to "keep this feature out of CI" and prevent it from "being enabled by anyone not expecting it" because the feature is "still highly experimental."
  4. **Similar to previous commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (removing 'default UBSAN'): NO CVE - configuration change
     - Similar Commit 2 (fixing arithmetic wraparound in sr driver): NO CVE - overflow fix
     - Similar Commit 3 (restoring ARCH_HAS_UBSAN dependency): NO CVE - build fix
     - Similar Commit 4 (grammar fix): NO CVE - documentation fix
     - Similar Commit 5 (fixing signed overflow in ipv6): YES CVE - actual security vulnerability fix
  5. **Code impact**: The change only affects when the feature can be enabled during kernel configuration. It doesn't fix any runtime security issue or vulnerability in the kernel code itself.
  This is a build configuration change to prevent an experimental feature from being accidentally enabled, not a security vulnerability fix.
f1706e0e1a74b soc: aspeed: Add NULL check in aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the aspeed_lpc_enable_snoop() function. When devm_kasprintf() fails due to memory allocation failure, it returns NULL. The code previously did not check for this condition and would pass the NULL pointer in misc->name to misc_register(), which subsequently passes it to device_create_with_groups(). This causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference when the kernel tries to format the device name string using the NULL pointer.
  Key security characteristics:
  1. **Memory allocation failure path**: The vulnerability is triggered when memory allocation fails in devm_kasprintf()
  2. **Kernel crash**: Results in a NULL pointer dereference in kernel space, leading to a kernel panic/crash
  3. **Local DoS potential**: While memory allocation failures are typically not directly controllable by unprivileged users, in low memory conditions or with memory pressure, this could lead to a denial of service
  4. **Driver probe path**: The vulnerability occurs during device probe, which happens during driver initialization
  The fix properly adds a NULL check after devm_kasprintf() and implements proper error handling with cleanup of allocated resources (kfifo_free and misc_deregister), preventing the NULL pointer dereference.
d9f0a97e859bd soc: aspeed: lpc: Fix impossible judgment condition
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: The bug is a logic error where the code incorrectly checks for `!lpc_snoop->irq` when `platform_get_irq()` returns a negative error value. Since negative values are non-zero, the check fails to catch error conditions.
  2. **Limited impact**: When `platform_get_irq()` returns a negative error (like -ENODEV), the code proceeds to call `devm_request_irq()` with that negative IRQ number. The `devm_request_irq()` function will properly handle the invalid IRQ and return an error, which the code then catches and handles appropriately (lines 175-178).
  3. **No exploitable condition**: This is a benign programming error that results in an unnecessary attempt to request an invalid IRQ. The kernel's IRQ subsystem will reject the invalid request, and the driver will fail to initialize properly - which is the correct behavior when no valid IRQ is available.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: This fix is similar to the reference commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO", particularly:
     - "ASoC: cs35l56: Accept values greater than 0 as IRQ numbers" - fixing IRQ validation
     - "irqchip/loongarch-cpu: Fix return value of lpic_gsi_to_irq()" - fixing IRQ return value handling
     - "rtase: Fix a check for error in rtase_alloc_msix()" - fixing IRQ error checking
  The commit simply corrects the error checking logic to properly detect when `platform_get_irq()` returns an error, preventing an unnecessary (but harmless) call to `devm_request_irq()` with an invalid IRQ number.
e4f59f873c3ff ARM: aspeed: Don't select SRAM
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change simply removes an unnecessary Kconfig dependency. The commit message clearly states that ASPEED devices have SRAM but "don't require it for basic function (or any function; there's no known users of the driver)".
  2. **Configuration Change Only**: This is a build configuration change that removes the forced selection of the SRAM driver. It doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities, memory corruption issues, or access control problems.
  3. **No Impact on Functionality**: While I found that the FSI master driver (`fsi-master-ast-cf.c`) does use SRAM through device tree bindings (`of_gen_pool_get`), removing the Kconfig selection doesn't break this - the SRAM driver can still be manually enabled if needed for specific use cases.
  4. **Clean-up Nature**: This is a clean-up commit that removes an unnecessary dependency that was added in the original commit but turned out to be unneeded. The SRAM driver provides a generic memory pool allocation API, but ASPEED BMCs don't require it for their basic operation.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Like the reference commits marked "NO CVE", this is a configuration/device tree fix that doesn't address any security vulnerability. It's similar to the other commits that fix configuration issues (GPU frequencies, clock management, etc.) without security implications.
cfe035d8662cf arm64: dts: mt6359: Rename RTC node to match binding expectations
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a purely cosmetic device tree change that renames a node from "mt6359rtc" to "rtc" to match the DT binding requirements. 
  The change:
  - Only modifies the node name/label in the device tree
  - Does not affect any functionality, memory handling, access control, or security boundaries
  - Is a simple naming convention fix to satisfy DT schema validation
  - The node still uses the same compatible string ("mediatek,mt6358-rtc")
  - No actual code logic is changed
  This is similar to the reference commits which also renamed DT nodes (like "mt6397regulator" to "regulators", "cir" to "ir-receiver", etc.) to match binding expectations, and none of those were assigned CVEs. These are documentation/specification compliance fixes rather than security vulnerability fixes.
652eea251dd85 arm64: dts: renesas: white-hawk-ard-audio: Fix TPU0 groups
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a device tree configuration fix that updates a pin group name from "tpu_to0_a" to "tpu_to0_b" to match the naming convention change made in the pinctrl driver (commit 3d144ef10a448f89). 
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Non-security functional fix**: The change fixes a broken audio clock configuration on the White Hawk ARD audio board. Without this fix, the sound driver doesn't receive a clock signal, which is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Device tree configuration change**: This is purely a device tree source file change that updates pin group naming to match the driver's pin group definitions. It doesn't modify any kernel code that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
  3. **Hardware-specific configuration**: This affects only the specific White Hawk ARD audio board with DA7212 codec. It's a board-specific configuration issue that prevents proper audio functionality when the pin group names don't match between the device tree and the pinctrl driver.
  4. **No security impact**: The commit message clearly states "the sound driver does not receive a clock signal" - this is a functionality issue where audio simply doesn't work, not a vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise.
  Similar to the reference commits provided (which all have CVE Status: NO), this is a hardware configuration/device tree fix that addresses functional correctness rather than security issues.
ea172f61f4fdb arm64: dts: qcom: qcs615: Fix up UFS clocks
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the additional context gathered:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a device tree (DTS) fix that reorders clock names and frequencies to match the binding expectations. The code changes show:
     - Moving "ice_core_clk" from position 5 to position 8 in the clock-names array
     - Reordering the corresponding clock frequencies in the opp-table
  2. **No Security Impact**: The changes are purely cosmetic/correctness fixes to match the device tree binding schema. According to the bindings file (qcom,ufs.yaml), qcs615 expects clocks in a specific order:
     - core_clk, bus_aggr_clk, iface_clk, core_clk_unipro, ref_clk, tx_lane0_sync_clk, rx_lane0_sync_clk, ice_core_clk
  3. **Build/Configuration Issue Only**: This would likely cause device tree validation errors or warnings, but not a security vulnerability. The UFS driver would still function, though potentially with mismatched clock configurations.
  4. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided (related to UFS clock references, PHY compatibility, etc.) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they fix device tree configuration issues without security implications.
  5. **No Exploitation Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this clock ordering issue to gain privileges, cause denial of service, or access sensitive information. It's a hardware description correctness issue.
  This is a typical device tree maintenance fix that ensures the hardware description matches the expected binding schema, with no security ramifications.
7ebdb205d4b9d arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Remove mdss_hdmi_phy phandle argument
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. The commit is fixing line 2797 where `<&mdss_hdmi_phy 0>` is being changed to `<&mdss_hdmi_phy>`. Since mdss_hdmi_phy has `#clock-cells = <0>`, it should not have any arguments.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Impact**: This is a device tree specification error that causes incorrect clock lookup indexing. While it's a bug, it doesn't create any security vulnerability - no privilege escalation, no memory corruption, no information disclosure, etc.
  2. **Functional Bug, Not Security**: The commit message clearly explains this is fixing a "turbo sneaky bug" where dtc (device tree compiler) misinterprets `<&mdss_hdmi_phy 0>` as two separate entries `<&mdss_hdmi_phy>, <0>` when `#clock-cells = <0>`. This causes subsequent clock array entries to be looked up at wrong indices.
  3. **Configuration/Specification Fix**: This is correcting a device tree specification to match the actual hardware description. The hdmi_phy node declares it provides only one clock (`#clock-cells = <0>`), so referencing it with an argument is incorrect syntax.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided (commits 1-5) also deal with clock-cells properties and device tree fixes, and none were assigned CVEs. They are all configuration/specification corrections without security implications.
  5. **Limited Impact**: This only affects clock lookup for the HDMI subsystem on MSM8998 devices, causing potential functional issues but no security vulnerabilities.
  The fix is important for proper hardware initialization and function, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as there's no exploitable security vulnerability.
f4220c41decc1 arm64: dts: qcom: msm8998: Use the header with DSI phy clock IDs
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE. It is purely a cosmetic change that improves code readability by replacing hardcoded numeric values (0, 1) with named constants (DSI_BYTE_PLL_CLK, DSI_PIXEL_PLL_CLK) from a header file. The constants are defined as exactly the same values being replaced:
  - DSI_BYTE_PLL_CLK = 0
  - DSI_PIXEL_PLL_CLK = 1
  The changes only affect device tree clock assignments for the DSI PHY in the display subsystem, with no functional changes, no security vulnerabilities fixed, and no runtime behavior modifications. This is a standard code maintainability improvement that replaces magic numbers with self-documenting constant names.
e07d2d57a1c72 arm64: dts: qcom: qcm2290: fix (some) of QUP interconnects
- [sasha] Let me work within the constraints and analyze the commit based on the provided information.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a device tree (DTS) configuration error fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes incorrect interconnect routing specifications where `MASTER_APPSS_PROC` was mistakenly used instead of `SLAVE_QUP_0` for the config_noc interconnect in multiple QUP (Qualcomm Universal Peripheral) nodes.
  2. **Security impact**: The changes only affect interconnect routing configuration for peripherals (SPI and UART interfaces). This is a functional correctness issue, not a security issue. The incorrect routing would likely cause performance issues or functional problems, but not security vulnerabilities.
  3. **Code changes analysis**: All changes follow the same pattern - replacing:
     ```
     &config_noc MASTER_APPSS_PROC RPM_ALWAYS_TAG
     ```
     with:
     ```
     &config_noc SLAVE_QUP_0 RPM_ALWAYS_TAG
     ```
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: The provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO") also fix device tree configuration issues - incorrect interconnect paths, missing GPIOs, wrong compatible strings, and incorrect PHY supplies. None of these configuration fixes represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No security-relevant patterns**: The commit doesn't fix any of the typical security issues like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory leaks
     - Access control problems
     - Input validation issues
     - Race conditions
     - Privilege escalation
  This is a simple copy-paste error correction in device tree configuration that affects peripheral interconnect routing, with no security implications.
febd8c6ab52c6 arm64: dts: rockchip: disable unrouted USB controllers and PHY on RK3399 Puma with Haikou
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit is disabling USB controllers that were never properly routed on the hardware. According to the commit message, "The HOST0_DP/DM lanes aren't routed on RK3399 Puma" - this means these USB controllers were physically disconnected and non-functional.
  2. **Hardware Configuration Issue**: This is a device tree correction that properly reflects the actual hardware configuration. The USB controllers being disabled (`usb_host0_ehci` and `usb_host0_ohci`) were incorrectly enabled but couldn't function due to missing physical connections.
  3. **No Security Impact**: The changes only remove two status="okay" lines for USB controllers that were already non-functional due to hardware routing. This cannot be exploited for any security purpose as:
     - The hardware lanes are not physically connected
     - No data flow was possible through these controllers
     - This is purely a configuration cleanup
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided with "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern - device tree corrections for hardware configuration issues without security implications.
  The commit is simply cleaning up the device tree to accurately represent the hardware capabilities, removing references to USB controllers that were never usable due to the physical board design.
3373af1d76bac arm64: dts: rockchip: disable unrouted USB controllers and PHY on RK3399 Puma
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the context from the kernel tree, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Hardware Configuration Cleanup Only**: The commit explicitly disables USB controllers (u2phy1_host, usb_host1_ehci, usb_host1_ohci) that are physically unrouted on the RK3399 Puma board. The commit message clearly states "The HOST1_DP/DM lanes aren't routed on RK3399 Puma" and "No intended functional change."
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The change does not fix any security vulnerability such as:
     - No buffer overflow fixes
     - No access control improvements
     - No privilege escalation fixes
     - No input validation improvements
     - No race condition fixes
     - No memory corruption fixes
  3. **Pure Hardware Description Accuracy**: This is purely making the Device Tree (DTS) accurately reflect the actual hardware implementation. The USB controllers being disabled were never functional because they lack physical connections on the PCB.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" - they are all Device Tree modifications that adjust hardware configurations to match actual board implementations without fixing any security issues.
  5. **No Attack Vector**: Since these USB controllers were physically unrouted, they could never have been used for any attack vector. Disabling them in software simply prevents the kernel from trying to initialize hardware that doesn't exist.
  The commit is a correctness fix to align the software configuration with the physical hardware design, with no security implications whatsoever.
4becd72352b68 arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: add the missing l2 cache node
- [sasha] I see I'm not in the kernel tree. Let me analyze based on the commit information provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Non-security impact**: This is a device tree fix that corrects the cache topology description for the SM8650 SoC. The change adds a missing L2 cache node (`l2_300`) for CPU3 and updates CPU3 to reference this new cache node instead of sharing `l2_200` with CPU2.
  2. **Documentation/description fix**: This is fixing an incorrect hardware description in the device tree. The commit message clearly states "Only two little a520s share the same L2, every a720 has their own L2 cache" - this is correcting the cache topology to match the actual hardware design.
  3. **No functional security vulnerability**: An incorrect cache topology description in the device tree doesn't create a security vulnerability. It might affect performance optimizations or scheduling decisions, but it doesn't create an exploitable security issue.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), none were assigned CVEs. They all involve adding or correcting cache descriptions, DMA coherency properties, or other hardware description fixes in device tree files.
  5. **Hardware description accuracy**: The change simply ensures the device tree accurately reflects that each Cortex-A720 core (CPU2, CPU3, CPU4) has its own L2 cache, which is the correct hardware configuration for this SoC.
  This is a straightforward device tree correction that improves hardware description accuracy but does not fix any security vulnerability.
f52cd248d844f arm64: defconfig: mediatek: enable PHY drivers
- [sasha] Based on the information provided in the commit message and changes, let me analyze this:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Configuration change only**: This is purely a defconfig change that enables PHY drivers as kernel modules (`=m`) in the ARM64 default configuration. It's not fixing a security vulnerability.
  2. **Functional fix, not security fix**: The commit fixes a display driver probe failure by ensuring required PHY drivers are enabled in the defconfig. This is addressing a functional regression where displays stopped working due to missing driver configuration.
  3. **No security impact**: The commit message clearly states this fixes probe failures for display drivers on specific MediaTek platforms. There's no mention of any security implications, privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant issues.
  4. **Build configuration adjustment**: This is responding to commit 924d66011f24 which stopped automatically selecting these PHY drivers. This new commit simply ensures they're still built by explicitly enabling them in defconfig.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all involve display/DPI/HDMI configuration changes for MediaTek platforms, and none were assigned CVEs. They're all functional fixes or configuration adjustments.
  The changes are:
  ```
  +CONFIG_PHY_MTK_HDMI=m
  +CONFIG_PHY_MTK_MIPI_DSI=m
  +CONFIG_PHY_MTK_DP=m
  ```
  These simply enable three MediaTek PHY drivers as modules in the default kernel configuration, ensuring displays work properly on affected platforms.
f2420037d90a8 ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064: move replicator out of soc node
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and understanding of CoreSight components:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a purely structural device tree reorganization that moves the replicator node from inside the soc node to the top-level. The commit message clearly states it's moving the replicator "out of soc node" because "The CoreSight static replicator device isn't a part of the system MMIO bus."
  2. **No security implications**: 
     - The replicator is a CoreSight tracing component used for debugging/tracing ARM processors
     - Moving its location in the device tree hierarchy doesn't change its functionality or access controls
     - No memory addresses, permissions, or security-sensitive configurations are modified
     - The connections between components (remote-endpoint references) remain unchanged
  3. **Type of fix**: This is a correctness/organization fix to properly represent the hardware topology in the device tree. The replicator is a static component that doesn't have memory-mapped registers (unlike other CoreSight components like ETB, TPIU, funnel which have reg properties), so it shouldn't be under the soc bus node.
  4. **Similar commits**: The provided similar commits (CVE Status: NO) show that device tree reorganizations, compatible string updates, and node additions for hardware description are not considered security vulnerabilities.
  This is a housekeeping change to follow proper device tree conventions, with no security impact whatsoever.
325c6a441ae1f ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064 merge hw splinlock into corresponding syscon device
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This is purely a device tree restructuring change that moves hardware spinlock description from using a syscon reference to a direct register mapping. The functionality remains the same.
  2. **Cosmetic/Schema Compliance Change**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "follow up the expected way of describing the SFPB hwspinlock" and fix "dt-schema warnings". This is about conforming to device tree schema guidelines, not fixing a security issue.
  3. **No Functional Impact**: The hardware spinlock (hwmutex) still operates at the same memory addresses - it's just described differently in the device tree:
     - Old: Base 0x01200000 + offset 0x604
     - New: Direct address 0x01200600
     
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (CVE Status: NO), which are all device tree updates to comply with bindings and fix schema warnings.
  5. **No Security-Sensitive Components Affected**: While hardware spinlocks are used for inter-processor synchronization (as evidenced by SMEM using them), this change doesn't modify their behavior or access control - it's merely a syntactic reorganization of how they're described in the device tree.
  This is a maintenance/cleanup commit that improves device tree organization but has no security implications.
4b0eb149df58b ARM: dts: qcom: apq8064: add missing clocks to the timer node
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the related code:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds missing clock references (`sleep_clk` and `clock-names = "sleep"`) to the timer device tree node to fix a DT schema warning and better describe the hardware.
  2. **No security impact**: 
     - The timer driver (`drivers/clocksource/timer-qcom.c`) doesn't actually use or require the sleep clock - it only uses the `clock-frequency` property
     - The sleep clock is already defined in the device tree as a 32768 Hz fixed clock
     - This is purely a device tree correctness/documentation fix
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is very similar to the provided reference commits that fix sleep clock frequencies in device trees, all of which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Those commits also made minor corrections to clock definitions without any security implications.
  4. **No vulnerability fixed**: The commit message clearly states it's fixing "DT schema warning" and to "describe hardware properly" - there's no mention of any security issue, vulnerability, or functional problem being addressed.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: Missing the clock reference in the device tree node doesn't create any vulnerability - the timer continues to function normally using the clock-frequency property.
  This is a pure device tree housekeeping change to satisfy schema validation and properly document hardware connections, with no security implications whatsoever.
9baa27a2e9fc7 dt-bindings: vendor-prefixes: Add Liontron name
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a purely documentation change that adds a vendor prefix "liontron" to the device tree bindings vendor list. It only modifies `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.yaml`.
  2. **No security implications**: Adding a vendor prefix to the documentation has no security impact. It doesn't:
     - Fix any vulnerability
     - Change any code execution paths
     - Modify memory handling
     - Alter access controls
     - Fix input validation issues
     - Address any security-sensitive functionality
  3. **Similar commits pattern**: All the similar commits provided (NeoFidelity, GOcontroll, vendor prefix corrections, pin name typos) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", confirming that vendor prefix additions and similar documentation/naming changes do not warrant CVEs.
  4. **Documentation-only change**: The file being modified (`vendor-prefixes.yaml`) is purely a registry of vendor names used in device tree bindings. It's a documentation file that helps maintain consistency in device tree naming conventions but has no runtime impact on the kernel.
  This is a routine maintenance commit that adds a new vendor to the device tree bindings documentation, with no security relevance whatsoever.
152f33ee30ee6 bus: fsl_mc: Fix driver_managed_dma check
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a race condition fix for a TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) issue in the driver probing path. The fix changes from:
     ```c
     struct fsl_mc_driver *mc_drv = to_fsl_mc_driver(dev->driver);
     // ...
     if (!ret && dev->driver && !mc_drv->driver_managed_dma)
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     const struct device_driver *drv = READ_ONCE(dev->driver);
     // ...
     if (!ret && drv && !to_fsl_mc_driver(drv)->driver_managed_dma)
     ```
  2. **Limited Security Impact**: While this could theoretically lead to a NULL pointer dereference and kernel crash, it's:
     - A stability/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability
     - Requires very specific timing during device probing
     - Not easily exploitable by an attacker
     - Described as a fix "for correctness" in the commit message
  3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involved:
     - Remote attackers causing crashes or memory corruption
     - Use-after-free vulnerabilities with clear exploitation paths
     - Memory safety issues that could lead to privilege escalation
     
     This commit, in contrast, is fixing a narrow race condition in the driver probe path that would at worst cause a denial of service.
  4. **Discovery Context**: The issue was found during normal development by kernel developers (Robin Murphy and Will McVicker), not as a security vulnerability, and affects a specific timing window during IOMMU probe that races with driver binding.
  This is a typical kernel reliability fix that improves code correctness but doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment.
d694bf8a9acdb bus: fsl-mc: fix double-free on mc_dev
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a double-free vulnerability in the `fsl_mc_device_add()` function's error handling path. The vulnerability occurs because:
  1. **Memory allocation pattern**: When the device type is "dprc", the code allocates a `fsl_mc_bus` structure and sets `mc_dev` to point to `&mc_bus->mc_dev` (an embedded field within mc_bus). In all other cases, `mc_dev` is allocated separately.
  2. **The double-free bug**: The blamed commit a042fbed0290 simplified the error cleanup by always freeing both `mc_bus` and `mc_dev`. However, when `mc_bus` is allocated, `mc_dev` points to memory within `mc_bus`, so freeing both causes a double-free of the same memory region.
  3. **Security impact**: Double-free vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, use-after-free conditions, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is triggered in error paths when device initialization fails (e.g., unknown device type, device_add() failure).
  4. **Attack surface**: The FSL-MC bus driver handles Management Complex devices in NXP/Freescale systems. An attacker who can trigger device initialization failures could potentially exploit this double-free vulnerability.
  The fix correctly restores the conditional logic: if `mc_bus` was allocated (meaning mc_dev points within it), only free `mc_bus`. Otherwise, free `mc_dev`. This matches the allocation pattern and prevents the double-free.
8e39fbb1edbb4 nilfs2: do not propagate ENOENT error from nilfs_btree_propagate()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's fixing an incorrect error code propagation issue where `-ENOENT` (an internal "not found" error) was being incorrectly returned to userspace instead of `-EIO` (which properly indicates metadata corruption).
  The key evidence from the code:
  1. The change only modifies error reporting - converting `-ENOENT` to `-EINVAL` in line 2110, which is then converted to `-EIO` by `nilfs_bmap_convert_error()`
  2. No memory corruption, crashes, or exploitable conditions are involved
  3. The worst impact is userspace applications receiving an unexpected error code (`-ENOENT` instead of `-EIO`)
  Unlike the similar commits marked with CVE status YES (which involved actual corruption handling, crashes, or memory safety issues), this is purely a quality/correctness fix for error reporting, not a security vulnerability.
f43f024292954 nilfs2: add pointer check for nilfs_direct_propagate()
- [sasha] Let me compare this with the similar commits that have CVE status to understand the security implications better.
  Looking at the similar commits provided:
  1. **Similar Commits 1 & 2** (CVE Status: YES) - "nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mappings"
     - Fixed a kernel BUG in submit_bh_wbc() due to missing corruption detection
     - Added checks to detect DAT metadata corruption and return -EINVAL
     - Could cause kernel panic/crash
  2. **Similar Commits 3 & 4** (CVE Status: YES) - "nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_dirty_buffer tracepoint"
     - Fixed NULL pointer dereference that could cause kernel crash
     - Issue with uninitialized buffer head device pointer
  3. **Similar Commit 5** (CVE Status: YES) - "nilfs2: fix potential null-ptr-deref in nilfs_btree_insert()"
     - Fixed NULL pointer dereference due to missing consistency check
     - Could cause kernel crash with corrupted filesystem
  ## Analysis of the current commit:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Missing Security Check**: The commit fixes a missing validation check for corrupted metadata, similar to Similar Commits 1 & 2 which were assigned CVEs.
  2. **Filesystem Corruption Impact**: Without this check, when `nilfs_direct_get_ptr()` returns `NILFS_BMAP_INVALID_PTR` (0) due to metadata corruption, the code would incorrectly pass this to DAT update functions, potentially causing:
     - Incorrect freeing of DAT entries that shouldn't be freed
     - Loss of filesystem consistency
     - Data corruption during writeback operations
  3. **Exploitable via Corrupted Filesystem**: Like the similar CVE commits, this vulnerability can be triggered by mounting a corrupted nilfs2 filesystem image, making it potentially exploitable by unprivileged users who can mount filesystems.
  4. **Long-standing Issue**: The Fixes tag points to commit 36a580eb489f ("nilfs2: direct block mapping") which appears to be from the initial implementation, indicating this has been a vulnerability for a long time.
  The security impact is similar to the other nilfs2 CVEs - it allows corrupted filesystem metadata to cause incorrect behavior that can lead to filesystem corruption and potentially system instability.
cdc3ed3035d0f ocfs2: fix possible memory leak in ocfs2_finish_quota_recovery
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Memory leak, not security vulnerability**: The issue is a memory leak in an error path where `ocfs2_finish_quota_recovery()` may exit early without freeing all allocated memory in `rec->r_list[]`. Memory leaks in error paths are generally not considered security vulnerabilities unless they can be triggered remotely or lead to denial of service.
  2. **Limited impact**: The memory leak occurs only during quota recovery operations, which happen during filesystem mount or recovery from crashes. This is not a frequently executed path that can be triggered by unprivileged users.
  3. **Error path cleanup issue**: Looking at the code change, it simply replaces `kfree(rec)` with `ocfs2_free_quota_recovery(rec)`. The function `ocfs2_free_quota_recovery()` properly frees all the recovery chunks in the list before freeing the main structure, which `kfree()` alone would not do.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the first two example commits (ocfs2 space leak fixes) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Those also fixed resource leaks in the ocfs2 filesystem but were not assigned CVEs.
  5. **No security boundary crossed**: The leak doesn't cross any security boundaries, doesn't allow privilege escalation, and doesn't enable unauthorized access to data.
  The fix is a proper cleanup improvement that ensures all dynamically allocated memory is freed in error paths, but it doesn't address a security vulnerability.
734aa85390ea6 Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a shift-out-of-bounds UBSAN warning that occurs when `sb_min_blocksize()` returns 0, causing `devblksize_log2` to be set to 64. This leads to undefined behavior in shift operations.
  2. **Trigger conditions**: The issue requires a specific race condition where an ioctl to change the loop device block size occurs simultaneously with mounting a Squashfs filesystem. This is a very narrow window and requires local access.
  3. **Security impact**: The commit message and code changes show this causes:
     - UBSAN warnings (shift-out-of-bounds)
     - Mount failure
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data disclosure
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - The GFS2 commit (CVE: YES) involved actual metadata corruption and invalid block access
     - Other similar UBSAN fixes in squashfs, ocfs2, and jfs (CVE: NO) were also just fixing undefined behavior without security impact
  5. **Fix nature**: The fix is a simple validation check that returns -EINVAL when `sb_min_blocksize()` returns 0, preventing the filesystem from mounting with an invalid configuration.
  This is a robustness/reliability fix rather than a security vulnerability. It prevents undefined behavior but doesn't fix an exploitable security issue.
421777a02bbd9 soc: qcom: smp2p: Fix fallback to qcom,ipc parse
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional regression but does not address a security vulnerability. The change simply updates the error code check from `-ENODEV` to `-ENOENT` to match the new behavior of `mbox_request_channel()` after commit 24fdd5074b20.
  Key analysis points:
  1. **No security impact**: The code changes the error code comparison from `-ENODEV` to `-ENOENT`. This is purely a functional fix to handle the changed return value from `mbox_request_channel()`.
  2. **Fallback mechanism**: The code implements a fallback from the newer `mboxes` property to the deprecated `qcom,ipc` property. Both methods achieve the same functionality (inter-processor communication setup).
  3. **No exploitable condition**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issue. The worst case is that the driver would fail to probe when using device trees without the `mboxes` property.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to commits 1-3 in the examples which handle error path fixes and API changes without security implications.
  The commit is a simple compatibility fix to ensure the driver continues to work with both old and new device tree bindings after an API change in the mailbox subsystem.
6b8deb2ff0d31 arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-common-proc-board: Enable OSPI1 on J721E
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can provide a determination.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of Change**: This is a device tree configuration change that simply enables the OSPI1 (Octal SPI) flash controller on the J721E board. The change adds `status = "okay"` to enable a previously disabled peripheral.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit doesn't fix any security issue. It's enabling hardware functionality that was previously disabled by the referenced commit 73676c480b72, which disabled OSPI nodes by default to ensure they're only enabled when properly configured at the board level.
  3. **Configuration Fix**: This is a functional fix, not a security fix. The commit message indicates it's fixing the fact that OSPI1 wasn't enabled despite having the MT25QU512AB Serial NOR flash connected to it on the J721E SoM (System on Module).
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided (with CVE Status: NO) are also device tree changes that modify hardware configurations, clock IDs, GPIO counts, or compatible strings - none of which are security-related.
  5. **No Security Impact**: Enabling a flash controller that was previously disabled doesn't expose any security vulnerabilities or fix any existing ones. It's simply making hardware accessible that should have been accessible based on the board's hardware configuration.
  The change is a straightforward board-level configuration correction to enable a flash memory interface that exists on the hardware but wasn't properly enabled in the device tree.
dfb25484bd73c arm64: tegra: Add uartd serial alias for Jetson TX1 module
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me analyze the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit adds a missing serial alias for the UART device (uartd/serial@70006300) that is used for Bluetooth connectivity on the Jetson TX1 module. The change is purely a device tree configuration fix that addresses a functional issue where the serial-tegra driver fails to probe due to a missing alias.
  Key analysis points:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states this prevents the Bluetooth device from being accessible - this is a functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. The driver simply fails to initialize without the alias.
  2. **No security impact**: Looking at the code in serial-tegra.c (line 1435-1438), the driver uses `of_alias_get_id()` to get the port number and returns an error if it fails. This is a standard initialization failure with no security implications.
  3. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the referenced commits which also fix device tree configuration issues:
     - Similar Commit 1: Added missing compatible string for WiFi node (NO CVE)
     - Similar Commit 2: Fixed incorrect alias paths (NO CVE)
     - Similar Commit 5: Fixed Bluetooth node address (NO CVE)
  4. **No privilege escalation or memory safety issues**: The change only adds `serial3 = &uartd;` to the aliases section, which is a simple mapping that allows the driver to identify the port number during initialization.
  5. **Denial of service is not exploitable**: While the missing alias prevents Bluetooth from working, this is not an exploitable denial of service - it's simply a misconfiguration that prevents normal operation.
4cd763297c220 arm64: tegra: Drop remaining serial clock-names and reset-names
- [sasha] The 8250_tegra driver also uses `devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL)` without a clock name.
  ## Conclusion
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a device tree cleanup commit that removes unused properties (`clock-names` and `reset-names`) from serial UART nodes in Tegra186 and Tegra194 device trees. These properties were never used by the driver because:
  1. The UARTs use the compatible string "nvidia,tegra186-uart", "nvidia,tegra20-uart", which means they use the 8250_tegra driver
  2. The 8250_tegra driver calls `devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL)` and `devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared(&pdev->dev, NULL)` with NULL names, meaning it doesn't use named clocks or resets
  3. The presence of these unused properties was causing device tree validation warnings, which this commit fixes
  There is no security vulnerability here - this is purely a device tree cleanup to remove properties that were never used by the driver and were causing validation warnings.
8ffec7d62c695 arm64: dts: renesas: white-hawk-single: Improve Ethernet TSN description
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is a Device Tree Source (DTS) improvement that:
  1. **Adds an Ethernet alias** (`ethernet3 = &tsn0;`) - This allows U-Boot to properly set the MAC address from environment variables instead of using a random MAC address
  2. **Renames a PHY label** from `phy3` to `tsn0_phy` for better consistency and to avoid naming conflicts
  The changes are purely cosmetic/functional improvements:
  - Adding the alias prevents random MAC address assignment, which is a usability issue, not a security vulnerability
  - Renaming the PHY label is just for maintainability and has no security impact
  - No access control, memory management, or privilege issues are addressed
  - No input validation, buffer handling, or race conditions are fixed
  This is similar to the other DTS commits in the reference list (which all have CVE Status: NO) that make non-security related adjustments to device tree configurations like adding DMA coherency flags, fixing interrupt definitions, or correcting compatible strings.
8eca9e979a1ef arm64: dts: rockchip: Update eMMC for NanoPi R5 series
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Functional enhancement, not security fix**: The commit adds proper voltage regulator specifications and enables HS200 mode for the eMMC. These are functional improvements to properly configure the hardware, not fixes for security vulnerabilities.
  2. **No security implications in the changes**:
     - Adding `vmmc-supply` and `vqmmc-supply` provides proper voltage references for the eMMC controller
     - Enabling `mmc-hs200-1_8v` enables a higher speed mode
     - Adding `emmc_datastrobe` to pinctrl improves signal timing
     - None of these changes address memory corruption, access control, privilege escalation, or other security issues
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (which all have CVE Status: NO) also make device tree changes for hardware configuration - adding new boards, removing undocumented properties, or configuring SD/eMMC settings.
  4. **Device tree configuration**: This is purely a device tree configuration change that ensures the eMMC hardware operates with correct voltage levels and optimal performance settings. Missing these configurations might cause functional issues but not security vulnerabilities.
  The "Fixes:" tag in the commit message indicates this corrects an incomplete configuration from the original dtsi creation, but it's fixing a functional omission rather than a security vulnerability.
d8f10550448b0 arm64: dts: allwinner: a100: set maximum MMC frequency
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Configuration/Performance Enhancement**: The change adds a `max-frequency` property to set the maximum MMC frequency to 150 MHz for the A100 SoC. This is a configuration change to properly specify hardware capabilities, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The commit only sets frequency limits in the device tree. The absence of this property would result in the driver using its default of 52 MHz (as seen in sunxi-mmc.c:1428). Running at a lower frequency is not a security issue - it's a performance/functionality limitation.
  3. **Similar to Reference Commits**: The similar commits provided (setting clock frequencies, fixing compatible strings, correcting interrupt numbers) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they fix configuration issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
  4. **No Vulnerability Pattern**: The code changes don't show any of the typical security vulnerability patterns:
     - No buffer overflow fixes
     - No memory leak fixes  
     - No access control changes
     - No input validation improvements
     - No race condition fixes
     - No privilege escalation fixes
  5. **Device Tree Configuration**: This is purely a device tree configuration change that documents the hardware's maximum supported frequency. It doesn't fix any code execution path that could be exploited.
  The commit simply ensures the MMC controller operates within its documented specifications by setting the correct maximum frequency limit.
a706a593cb197 arm64: dts: rockchip: Add vcc-supply to SPI flash on rk3566-rock3c
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a hardware configuration fix that adds a missing power supply property to the SPI flash device node in the device tree. It resolves the warning "spi-nor spi4.0: supply vcc not found, using dummy regulator" by properly defining that the SPI flash uses the vcc_1v8 power supply, as specified in the board schematic.
  The change has no security implications - the SPI flash was already functional before this fix because the kernel automatically provides a dummy regulator when vcc-supply is not specified. This is purely a correctness issue to ensure the device tree accurately describes the hardware configuration.
635d0c8edf269 arm64: dts: qcom: x1e001de-devkit: Fix pin config for USB0 retimer vregs
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and examination of similar fixes in the Linux kernel tree, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Device Tree Configuration Fix**: This is a fix for incomplete GPIO pin configurations in a device tree file, adding missing properties (`power-source`, `bias-disable`, `input-disable`, `output-enable`) to voltage regulator control pins.
  2. **Functional, Not Security**: The changes ensure proper hardware configuration for USB retimer voltage regulators. While incomplete configurations could cause hardware malfunction, this is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  3. **Precedent from Similar Commits**: My analysis of the kernel history shows that GPIO pin configuration fixes in device trees are routinely treated as bug fixes, not security vulnerabilities. Similar commits fixing bias properties, power sources, and pin configurations are never assigned CVEs.
  4. **No Exploitable Attack Vector**: The fix doesn't address any:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Memory corruption
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote code execution
     - Denial of service that could be triggered by an attacker
  5. **Hardware Description Accuracy**: Device tree files describe hardware configuration to the kernel. Missing properties might cause improper hardware operation but don't create exploitable security conditions.
  The commit follows the same pattern as the reference commits provided (fixing USB PHY supplies), which were also marked as "CVE Status: NO". This is a standard device tree fix ensuring correct GPIO configuration for hardware components.
f76fdcd255099 arm64: dts: qcom: x1e001de-devkit: Describe USB retimers resets pin configs
- [sasha] Let me analyze this commit based on the provided information:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree (DTS) configuration change that adds pin configuration for USB retimer reset GPIOs. The change adds `pinctrl-0` and `pinctrl-names` properties to existing USB retimer nodes and defines the corresponding pin configuration states (`rtmr0_default`, `rtmr1_default`, `rtmr2_default`).
  2. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is fixing a configuration issue where pin configurations were being left to the bootloader rather than being explicitly defined in the device tree. This is a correctness/completeness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The changes only affect:
     - Pin function definitions (setting pins to GPIO mode)
     - Drive strength settings (2mA)
     - Bias settings (disabled)
     - Power source selection (1.8V for rtmr0)
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (like the PCIe GPIO fixes) which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". These are all device tree configuration fixes that ensure proper hardware initialization.
  5. **No exploitation potential**: There's no evidence that the previous state (relying on bootloader configuration) created any security vulnerability. The fix simply makes the configuration explicit in the kernel rather than implicit from the bootloader.
  The commit is a standard device tree configuration improvement that ensures deterministic hardware behavior, but it does not fix any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
f5110806b41ea arm64: dts: qcom: sda660-ifc6560: Fix dt-validate warning
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a device tree validation warning fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit simply adds `/delete-property/ clock-names;` to match the already existing `/delete-property/ clocks;` statements.
  2. **No security impact**: The change fixes a dt-validate warning about property dependencies. When the `clocks` property was deleted (as a workaround for a board lockup issue), the corresponding `clock-names` property should have been deleted too. This is purely a schema compliance issue.
  3. **Functional behavior unchanged**: The comments in the code indicate that deleting these clock properties is a workaround because "The board will lock up if we toggle the BLSP clock, unless the BAM DMA interconnects support is in place." The actual workaround was already in place - this commit just makes it properly compliant with device tree validation rules.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits shown (fixing clock frequencies, bluetooth properties, etc.) are all device tree corrections that were marked "CVE Status: NO". These are configuration/specification fixes, not security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no attack vector, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issue here. It's purely a cleanup to satisfy device tree validation tooling.
  This is a typical device tree maintenance commit that improves code quality and compliance with validation schemas, but has no security implications whatsoever.
dbf62a117a1b7 arm64: dts: qcom: sdm660-lavender: Add missing USB phy supply
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit adds a missing device tree property (`vdda-pll-supply`) for the USB PHY on the Xiaomi Lavender (Redmi Note 7) device. This is a device-specific configuration fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The missing property was caught by device tree schema validation (dtbs_check), which enforces proper hardware descriptions. The binding documentation clearly shows that `vdda-pll-supply` is a required property that provides a "1.8V regulator supply to PHY refclk pll block".
  3. **No security implications**: 
     - This is purely a hardware configuration issue for proper power supply mapping
     - It fixes a device tree validation error, not a runtime security issue
     - Missing power supply properties in device trees typically result in driver probe failures or non-functional hardware, not security vulnerabilities
     - The regulator (`vreg_l10a_1p8`) already exists in the device tree; it just wasn't connected to the PHY
  4. **Similar commits pattern**: All the similar commits shown (for x1e80100-qcp, x1e80100-crd, and msm8996-xiaomi-common) also deal with USB PHY regulator/supply fixes and none were assigned CVEs, confirming this is standard hardware enablement/configuration work.
  This is a routine device tree fix to ensure proper hardware description compliance, not a security vulnerability fix.
1fe38d2a19950 arm64: dts: mt6359: Add missing 'compatible' property to regulators node
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a device tree binding compliance fix. The commit adds a missing 'compatible' property to the regulators node to fix a dtb-check validation error.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The change does not fix any security vulnerability. It only adds a required property to make the device tree compliant with the binding schema defined in `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mediatek,mt6397.yaml`.
  3. **No functional impact**: Looking at the driver code in `drivers/mfd/mt6397-core.c`, the mt6359-regulator MFD cell doesn't use `.of_compatible` matching (unlike other cells like rtc, auxadc). This means the regulator functionality was already working without the compatible property in the device tree.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (removing deprecated `regulator-compatible` properties) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they were also device tree binding compliance fixes without security implications.
  5. **Validation error only**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes a "dtb-check error" - a build-time validation issue, not a runtime security or functionality problem.
  This is a housekeeping change to ensure device tree files comply with their binding specifications, not a security fix.
f9167f15dd4e7 arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8390-genio-common: Set ssusb2 default dual role mode to host
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree configuration fix that adjusts USB controller settings. The changes include:
     - Setting `role-switch-default-mode = "host"` to ensure proper detection of M.2 WiFi/Bluetooth modules
     - Fixing GPIO polarity from `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH` to `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW` for the USB connector ID pin
  2. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a functional problem where Bluetooth devices on M.2 modules were not being detected at startup because the USB controller defaulted to device mode instead of host mode. This is a hardware configuration/detection issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (6bb64877a415): Fixed USB3 PHY port status - NO CVE
     - Commit 2 (73955991b8fb): Moved common parts to dtsi file - NO CVE  
     - Commit 3 (cd17bcbd2b33): Fixed bluetooth node address - NO CVE
     - Commit 4 (be985531a5dd): Marked USB 3.0 as disabled - NO CVE
     - Commit 5 (de7dcf9d1df4): Added HWIDs for MT7925 - NO CVE
  4. **No security impact**: The fix addresses a hardware initialization/detection issue. There's no potential for:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Remote code execution
     - Any other security-relevant impact
  This is purely a functional fix to ensure proper hardware detection and operation of USB peripherals on these evaluation boards.
d77e89b7b03fb arm64: dts: mediatek: mt6357: Drop regulator-fixed compatibles
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree cleanup that removes incorrect "regulator-fixed" compatible properties from regulator nodes in the MT6357 PMIC device tree.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit is not fixing any security issue. It's removing redundant/incorrect compatible properties that:
     - Serve no functional purpose (as stated in commit message)
     - Are handled entirely by the mt6357-regulator driver
     - Don't affect the actual regulation functionality
  3. **Code analysis shows**:
     - The mt6357-regulator driver defines these regulators (vfe28, vrf18, vrf12, etc.) using MT6357_REG_FIXED macro at lines 399-403
     - These regulators are already handled by the mt6357 driver regardless of the "regulator-fixed" compatible
     - The compatible strings being removed are inconsistent with mt6358/mt6359 which don't have them
  4. **Impact is cosmetic**: The only impact mentioned is that DT kselftest shows failures because it identifies nodes with compatibles that aren't probed. This is a testing/validation issue, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to the reference commits**: All the similar commits shown (mt8195-cherry, mt8192-asurada, mt8195-demo, mt8173-evb, mt8173-elm) also removed deprecated "regulator-compatible" properties and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern - removing incorrect/deprecated properties from device tree files without any security implications.
a747c4dd2a60c arm64: dts: imx8mn-beacon: Set SAI5 MCLK direction to output for HDMI audio
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional Fix, Not Security**: The commit fixes a functional audio issue where HDMI audio fails to work due to incorrect clock direction configuration. The SAI5 master clock (MCLK) needs to be set as output to properly drive the ADV7535 HDMI bridge chip.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The change only adds the `fsl,sai-mclk-direction-output` property to the device tree, which:
     - Controls whether the SAI generates the master clock signal
     - Affects audio functionality but has no security implications
     - Cannot be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise
  3. **Hardware Configuration Issue**: This is a device tree configuration error that prevents proper hardware initialization. The worst outcome is non-functional HDMI audio, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided as examples (dealing with audio clock configurations, pin directions, and device tree fixes) were marked with "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the same pattern.
  5. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this missing property. It's a static hardware configuration that either works or doesn't work for audio output.
  The commit is a straightforward device tree fix that ensures the SAI5 interface properly outputs the master clock signal required by the HDMI audio subsystem.
8c716f80dfe8c arm64: dts: imx8mm-beacon: Set SAI5 MCLK direction to output for HDMI audio
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change adds the `fsl,sai-mclk-direction-output` property to configure the SAI5 master clock (MCLK) direction as output. This is a functional configuration fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Audio Configuration Issue**: The commit message clearly indicates this fixes an audio functionality issue where "The HDMI bridge chip fails to generate an audio source." This is a hardware configuration problem where the clock signal direction wasn't properly set.
  3. **No Security Impact**: Looking at the code changes and the SAI driver implementation, the MCLK direction control (FSL_SAI_MCTL_MCLK_EN bit) simply enables/disables the master clock output. This has no security implications - it doesn't affect:
     - Memory management or boundaries
     - Access control or permissions
     - Data validation or sanitization
     - Privilege levels
     - Information disclosure
  4. **Device Tree Configuration**: The change is purely in device tree configuration (`.dts` file), which describes hardware properties. It doesn't modify any kernel code that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they all fix audio/display hardware configuration issues in device tree files without any security implications.
  The commit simply ensures the i.MX8MM SoC drives the MCLK signal to the HDMI audio bridge chip, which is necessary for proper audio functionality. This is a standard hardware configuration requirement with no security relevance.
6821ee1753793 arm64: dts: imx8mp-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The change only adjusts the capacitive load setting of an RTC from 7000 to 12500 femtofarads. This is a hardware configuration parameter that affects clock accuracy/drift, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Functional Fix Only**: The commit message clearly states this fixes "RTC drift" - a timing accuracy issue where the clock runs too fast or slow over time. This is a functional bug, not a security issue.
  3. **No Sensitive Operations Affected**: Looking at the driver code, the capacitive load setting (`quartz-load-femtofarads`) only configures the `OSC_CAP_SEL` bits in the `CTRL_OSCILLATOR` register to match the physical capacitor connected to the crystal. Setting the wrong value causes frequency deviation but doesn't enable any unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or other security issues.
  4. **Similar Pattern to Non-CVE Commits**: The similar commits shown (adjusting DTS parameters for audio clocks, display settings, etc.) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they fix hardware configuration issues without security implications.
  5. **No Attack Vector**: An incorrect RTC capacitive load cannot be exploited by an attacker - it simply causes the clock to drift over time, which is a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability.
c3f03bec30efd arm64: dts: imx8mn-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The change fixes an RTC drift issue by correcting the capacitive load setting from 7000 to 12500 femtofarads. This is a hardware configuration correction that affects timekeeping accuracy, not security.
  2. **Configuration fix only**: The code change simply adds a device tree property (`quartz-load-femtofarads = <12500>`) that configures the RTC's oscillator capacitive load to match the actual hardware. This is a non-security hardware configuration parameter.
  3. **No security impact**: Looking at the driver code, this property only affects the `OSC_CAP_SEL` register bits in the RTC chip, which controls the internal oscillator's load capacitance. An incorrect value causes clock drift over time but does not create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No access control bypass
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This change is similar to the reference commits shown, which also fix device tree configuration issues (clock dividers, clock references, property values) and were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The commit is purely a functional fix to improve RTC accuracy by matching the software configuration to the hardware design, with no security implications.
2e98d456666d6 arm64: dts: imx8mm-beacon: Fix RTC capacitive load
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change fixes an RTC drift issue by correcting the capacitive load setting from 7000 to 12500 femtofarads. This is a hardware configuration issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Device Tree Configuration**: The change is purely in a device tree file (`imx8mm-beacon-som.dtsi`), which describes hardware configuration. It adds the line `quartz-load-femtofarads = <12500>;` to match the actual hardware's crystal oscillator capacitive load.
  3. **Functional Issue Only**: The commit message clearly states this fixes "RTC drift" - the real-time clock was not keeping accurate time over extended periods. This is a functional/accuracy issue, not a security issue.
  4. **No Security Impact**: An inaccurate RTC does not create any of the security vulnerabilities that would warrant a CVE:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service
     - No authentication bypass
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is similar to the provided reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" - they all fix device tree configuration issues like incorrect property values, clock settings, or hardware descriptions.
  The driver code shows this simply sets bits in the CTRL_OSCILLATOR register to configure the crystal oscillator's capacitive load, which affects timing accuracy but has no security implications.
d15059f7be59f arm64: dts: mt8183: Add port node to mt8183.dtsi
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE assignment. This is a device tree schema compliance fix that adds a missing "port" node to the DSI (Display Serial Interface) controller to satisfy the binding requirements. The changes are:
  1. **Schema compliance fix**: The mediatek,dsi.yaml binding requires either a "port" or "ports" node (lines 110-114 of the binding), but the original DSI node in mt8183.dtsi was missing this required property.
  2. **Non-security related changes**:
     - Adds an empty port node with endpoint to the DSI controller in mt8183.dtsi
     - Refactors mt8183-kukui.dtsi to reference the endpoint rather than creating its own ports structure
     - No functional behavior change - just restructuring to meet binding requirements
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (commits 1-5) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar device tree binding compliance fixes - adding missing port/ports nodes or fixing node names to match schema requirements.
  This is purely a device tree binding validation fix with no security implications. It doesn't fix any vulnerability, memory issue, access control problem, or other security-relevant bug.
53734383a7388 firmware: exynos-acpm: silence EPROBE_DEFER error on boot
- [sasha] Now I need to analyze the specific code changes shown in the commit. Based on the commit message and the changes provided, let me understand what this commit does:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a cosmetic/logging change that removes error messages during normal probe deferral scenarios. The commit only removes `dev_err()` calls that were incorrectly treating `-EPROBE_DEFER` as an error condition.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes do not affect:
     - Access control or permissions
     - Memory safety (no buffer overflow/underflow fixes)
     - Input validation
     - Authentication/authorization
     - Data confidentiality or integrity
     - Race conditions with security implications
  3. **Code analysis of changes**:
     - The removed `dev_err()` calls at lines 700, 709-710, and 716 were only logging messages
     - The actual error handling logic (returning `-EPROBE_DEFER`) remains unchanged
     - The `of_node_put()` call was simply moved to consolidate cleanup logic
     - No security boundaries are crossed or modified
  4. **EPROBE_DEFER behavior**: This is a standard Linux kernel mechanism for handling driver initialization order. When a driver's dependencies aren't ready yet, it returns `-EPROBE_DEFER` to retry later. This is normal behavior, not an error condition.
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the commits that simply converted error handling to use `dev_err_probe()` or handled `-EPROBE_DEFER` cases were assigned CVEs (Similar Commits 1, 2, and 4 all have "CVE Status: NO").
  This is a quality-of-life improvement that reduces unnecessary error logging during boot, with no security implications whatsoever.
67af3cd813695 firmware: exynos-acpm: fix reading longer results
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Looking at the code:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that in the original code:
  ```c
  xfer->txlen = sizeof(cmd);  // This is sizeof(u32*) = 8 bytes
  xfer->rxlen = sizeof(cmd);  // This is sizeof(u32*) = 8 bytes
  ```
  When `cmd` is passed as a pointer parameter, `sizeof(cmd)` returns the size of the pointer (8 bytes on 64-bit systems), not the size of the array it points to (16 bytes for `u32 cmd[4]`).
  This causes ACPM commands that return more than 8 bytes to not work correctly. The commit message explicitly states this is evident in `acpm_pmic_bulk_read()` where the function tries to access `xfer.rxd[2]` and `xfer.rxd[3]`, but these wouldn't be properly populated due to the incorrect rxlen.
  However, this is a functional bug that causes certain operations to fail, not a security vulnerability. There's no evidence of:
  - Memory corruption or buffer overflows
  - Information disclosure
  - Privilege escalation
  - Any exploitable condition
  The fix simply ensures the correct buffer size is passed so that longer responses can be properly received. This aligns with the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" which also fixed functional issues without security implications.
2eca6af66709d arm64: dts: qcom: sdm660-xiaomi-lavender: Add missing SD card detect GPIO
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit simply adds a missing `cd-gpios` (card detect GPIO) property to a device tree file for SD card functionality. Here's why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Functional enhancement, not a security fix**: The commit adds card detection via GPIO interrupt instead of polling. This is a performance/functionality improvement that allows the driver to detect SD card insertion/removal via interrupts rather than polling every second.
  2. **No security implications**: The missing GPIO doesn't create any security vulnerabilities such as:
     - No buffer overflows
     - No memory corruption 
     - No privilege escalation
     - No access control bypass
     - No information disclosure
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (1-3) all involve adding or fixing missing GPIO configurations in device tree files and were marked "CVE Status: NO". These are all hardware configuration fixes, not security fixes.
  4. **Device tree configuration**: This is purely a hardware configuration issue in the device tree that defines how the SD card slot hardware should be accessed. The `cd-gpios = <&tlmm 54 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>` line simply tells the kernel which GPIO pin to monitor for card insertion/removal events.
  5. **Documentation confirms normal usage**: The kernel documentation shows `cd-gpios` is a standard optional property for MMC controllers used for card detection, with no security implications.
  The commit message clearly states this is about fixing card detection functionality and improving driver efficiency by using interrupts instead of polling - a performance optimization, not a security fix.
394f29033324e arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8195: Reparent vdec1/2 and venc1 power domains
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree restructuring that moves power domain nodes (VDEC1, VDEC2, and VENC_CORE1) to be children of their parent domains (VDEC0 and VENC0 respectively). This is a hierarchical reorganization to reflect hardware dependencies.
  2. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit message clearly states this is fixing the power domain hierarchy to match hardware requirements - "the first and second core of the video decoder IP need the VDEC_SOC to be powered up in order to be able to be accessed." This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The change doesn't fix any of the typical security issues like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control bypass
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (adding HDMI power domains, adding ADC nodes, etc.), these are all device tree additions/modifications for hardware enablement and configuration, none of which were assigned CVEs.
  5. **Impact is functional, not security**: The issue being fixed would likely result in hardware not working properly (cores not being accessible when parent domain is off), rather than creating an exploitable security condition.
  This is a typical device tree fix for proper hardware description and power management sequencing, not a security vulnerability fix.
267623000d11f arm64: dts: mediatek: mt8188: Fix IOMMU device for rdma0
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context from the kernel tree:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Device tree configuration error, not a security vulnerability**: The change fixes an incorrect IOMMU device assignment in the device tree. The rdma0 device was incorrectly tied to vdo_iommu instead of vpp_iommu.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: According to the header file comments, larb1 (where M4U_PORT_L1_DISP_RDMA0 resides) is supposed to be connected to iommu-vpp, not iommu-vdo. This is just a configuration mismatch that prevents proper hardware functionality.
  3. **Impact is functional, not security-related**: The commit message clearly states this caused "the IOMMU to no longer work" and devices would be "left without an IOMMU attached". This is a functionality issue where the display subsystem wouldn't work properly, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
  4. **Recent detection, not exploitation**: The issue only manifested with Linux v6.15-rc1 IOMMU framework changes that made attachment checks stricter. Before this, the device simply wouldn't have IOMMU protection, but there's no indication this created an exploitable security hole.
  5. **Hardware isolation intact**: The two IOMMU instances (vdo_iommu and vpp_iommu) serve different sets of hardware blocks. Using the wrong one prevents functionality but doesn't create a security bypass or privilege escalation opportunity.
  This is similar to the reference commits shown, which are all device tree configuration fixes and enhancements without security implications.
c72ede1c24be6 ARM: dts: at91: at91sam9263: fix NAND chip selects
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the issue. The original configuration in at91sam9263.dtsi clearly shows that the chip select was on PD15 (pioD 15), not PA15 (pioA 15). When converting to the new bindings, this was incorrectly changed to pioA 15 in the board files.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Hardware functionality issue, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes an incorrect GPIO pin assignment for NAND chip select. Using the wrong GPIO (pioA 15 instead of pioD 15) would simply cause NAND to not work properly - it's a functional bug, not a security issue.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes show this is purely a device tree configuration fix for hardware pin assignments. An incorrect chip select GPIO would prevent NAND from functioning, but wouldn't create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond the intended functionality
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (at91sam9260.dtsi chip select fixes, imx6 chip select fixes, etc.) all have "CVE Status: NO" because they are hardware configuration fixes without security implications.
  4. **Limited scope**: This only affects specific AT91SAM9263-based boards where NAND functionality would be broken due to the incorrect GPIO assignment. It's a straightforward hardware configuration error introduced during a binding conversion.
  The commit simply corrects a transcription error where the chip select GPIO was incorrectly converted from `&pioD 15` to `&pioA 15` when migrating to new NAND bindings, restoring proper NAND functionality.
67ba341e57ab1 ARM: dts: at91: usb_a9263: fix GPIO for Dataflash chip select
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what this commit is actually changing:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Hardware Configuration Fix**: The commit fixes an incorrect GPIO pin assignment for the Dataflash chip select (CS) signal on the Calao USB A9263 board. It changes:
     - From: `<&pioB 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>` (Port B, Pin 15, Active High)
     - To: `<&pioA 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>` (Port A, Pin 5, Active Low)
  2. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a hardware configuration error that prevented the Dataflash from working properly. The wrong GPIO pin and polarity were specified in the device tree. This is not a security vulnerability but rather a functional bug that prevented the SPI flash device from operating correctly.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The issue only affects users of this specific board (Calao USB A9263) who need to use the Dataflash. It doesn't create any security risks such as:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: This commit is similar to the "CVE Status: NO" reference commits which also fix device tree configuration issues (USB interrupts, clock indices, chip selects, polarity settings) without any security implications.
  The commit simply corrects a board-specific hardware description error that prevented a peripheral from functioning, which is a functional fix rather than a security fix.
8ecd096d018be arm64: dts: rockchip: Move SHMEM memory to reserved memory on rk3588
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the additional context about ARM SCMI:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Non-security issue**: This is a device tree configuration fix that moves the SCMI shared memory location from a regular SRAM node to a reserved memory node. The change is correcting the memory mapping description, not fixing a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The commit message states "0x0 to 0xf0000000 are SDRAM memory areas where 0x10f000 is located." This is simply relocating the memory description to the appropriate DTS node (reserved-memory) to properly reflect the hardware layout.
  3. **Functional correctness, not security**: The change adds `no-map` attribute and moves the definition to reserved-memory section, which is the correct way to describe memory regions that should not be mapped by the kernel's normal memory management. This is a correctness issue, not a security issue.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is nearly identical to commit 8fbb9376f0c4 for rk356x, which was also not assigned a CVE. The pattern matches other DTS fixes in the similar commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO".
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication that the previous configuration created an exploitable condition. The SCMI shared memory was still protected by the SCMI protocol itself and proper access controls.
  The commit is fixing a device tree description to properly reflect the hardware memory layout, which is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
a37d21a9b45e4 arm64: dts: rockchip: Add missing uart3 interrupt for RK3528
- [sasha] So if `uart_read_and_validate_port_properties` returns an error (which it would when no IRQ is found), the probe would fail with `goto err_pmruntime`.
  Based on my analysis, this is what happens:
  1. The original DTS was missing the interrupts property for uart3
  2. When the UART driver probes uart3, it calls `uart_read_and_validate_port_properties`
  3. This function tries to get the IRQ and fails (returns error)
  4. The probe function fails, so uart3 never gets initialized
  5. This means uart3 is completely non-functional without the interrupt definition
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a device tree configuration bug that causes uart3 to be non-functional. It doesn't create any security vulnerability, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  2. **Functionality Issue Only**: The missing interrupt simply prevents uart3 from being properly initialized and working. The driver's error handling correctly rejects the device when no interrupt is specified.
  3. **Safe Failure Mode**: The kernel properly handles the missing interrupt by failing the device probe cleanly. There's no unsafe behavior, crash, or exploitable condition.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided as references (fixing DTS configurations for interrupts, reset names, sound-dai-cells, etc.) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are configuration/functionality fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Limited Impact**: This only affects systems using the RK3528 SoC that specifically need uart3. Other UARTs work fine, and the system remains stable.
  This is a standard device tree configuration fix that restores proper functionality to a hardware component, not a security vulnerability fix.
9bb5ca464100e arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: Fix domain-idle-state for CPU2
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the additional context gathered:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Configuration error, not a security vulnerability**: This is a device tree misconfiguration where CPU2 (a Cortex-A720 "gold" core) was incorrectly using the idle state parameters meant for "silver" cores (Cortex-A520). The change simply corrects which idle state configuration is used.
  2. **No direct security impact**: The differences between `silver_cpu_sleep_0` and `gold_cpu_sleep_0` are timing-related (entry/exit latencies and minimum residency times). Using the wrong idle state would primarily affect:
     - Power efficiency (suboptimal power savings)
     - Performance characteristics (faster wake times than intended)
     - Potentially system stability in edge cases
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they are all device tree fixes for:
     - Idle state compatible strings
     - Power domain assignments
     - CPU configuration updates
     - Timing parameter adjustments
  4. **Limited exploitability**: This misconfiguration cannot be exploited for privilege escalation, memory corruption, or data leakage. At worst, it could contribute to system instability or suboptimal power management.
  5. **Hardware-specific optimization**: The fix ensures the correct power management parameters are used for the specific CPU core type, which is a correctness/optimization issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves system correctness and efficiency, but it does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
54040a3e3da67 arm64: dts: qcom: qcs615: remove disallowed property in spmi bus node
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The commit removes an unused "cell-index" property from the device tree. This property is:
     - Not defined in the SPMI PMIC arbiter bindings (qcom,spmi-pmic-arb.yaml)
     - Not used by the SPMI PMIC arbiter driver (spmi-pmic-arb.c)
     - Simply a device tree validation cleanup to fix a warning
  2. **Nature of Change**: This is purely a device tree cleanup that:
     - Fixes a validation error reported by automated testing
     - Removes a property that was never evaluated or used
     - Has no functional impact on the system
  3. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO", they all involve:
     - Device tree property cleanups
     - Fixing validation errors
     - Moving or adjusting properties to match bindings
     - No security-relevant changes
  4. **No Attack Vector**: The removed property:
     - Does not affect memory management
     - Does not change access controls
     - Does not modify security boundaries
     - Does not fix any vulnerability
  This is a simple device tree maintenance change to ensure compliance with binding specifications, with no security implications whatsoever.
4f4c905e6a2a4 arm64: dts: qcom: ipq9574: Fix USB vdd info
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Configuration Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes an incorrect device tree configuration where USB PHYs were using the wrong regulator (L2 instead of L5). This is a hardware configuration error, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The change simply corrects which power regulator is referenced by the USB PHY. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service potential
  3. **Functional Impact Only**: The commit message clearly states this causes two functional issues:
     - The correct USB PHY regulator isn't controlled properly
     - An unrelated module powered by L2 is affected when USB tries to control it
     
     These are functionality/stability issues, not security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: The similar commits shown (commits 1-5) all fix regulator/power supply configurations in device trees and none were assigned CVEs. They're all hardware configuration corrections.
  5. **Device Tree Nature**: Device tree changes that correct hardware descriptions typically don't constitute security vulnerabilities unless they fix issues that could be exploited for security purposes (like disabling security features or exposing privileged resources).
  The commit is a straightforward hardware configuration fix that ensures the USB subsystem controls the correct power regulator, preventing potential hardware malfunction but not addressing any security vulnerability.
a2e617f4e6981 arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp-x13s: Drop duplicate DMIC supplies
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does NOT warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree configuration cleanup that removes redundant audio routing entries. The commit message clearly explains it's removing duplicate DMIC (Digital Microphone) power supply routes.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit only removes redundant routing entries (`"VA MIC BIAS1"`, `"VA MIC BIAS2"`, `"VA MIC BIAS3"`) that were duplicates. According to the commit message, only one power supply can be active at a time anyway, and the driver already prefers the internal regulator over pull-up mode.
  3. **No exploitable condition**: The code analysis shows that:
     - The WCD938x codec provides two different power modes for microphones: internal regulator ("MIC BIAS") and pull-up mode ("VA MIC BIAS")
     - Only one can be active at a time by design
     - The duplicate entries just caused brief unnecessary switching when shutting down the microphone
     - This is purely a power efficiency/cleanliness issue, not a security vulnerability
  4. **Similar commits context**: All the referenced similar commits (NO CVE status) are also device tree fixes for power supply configurations - correcting voltage regulators, adding DMI entries for hardware support, etc. None involve security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Impact**: The only functional difference is avoiding a brief switch to pull-up mode during microphone shutdown - a minor optimization with no security implications.
  This is a typical device tree cleanup/optimization commit for audio hardware configuration on the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s laptop, with no security relevance.
515551e65635b arm64: dts: qcom: sm8750: Correct clocks property for uart14 node
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Configuration error, not a security vulnerability**: The change fixes an incorrect clock assignment (`GCC_QUPV3_WRAP2_S5_CLK` → `GCC_QUPV3_WRAP2_S6_CLK`) for the UART14 device at address 0x898000. This is a simple device tree misconfiguration that would cause UART functionality to fail.
  2. **No security impact**: The commit fixes a functional issue where UART14 would not work properly due to using the wrong clock source. This would result in:
     - UART device not functioning or functioning incorrectly
     - No data corruption, privilege escalation, or security boundary violations
     - No ability to exploit this for malicious purposes
  3. **Pattern analysis confirms it's a typo**: Looking at the register mapping pattern:
     - 0x890000 → S4
     - 0x894000 → S5  
     - 0x898000 → S6 (incorrectly assigned S5)
     - 0x89c000 → S7
     
     The uart14 at 0x898000 should use S6 clock based on the sequential pattern, confirming this was a simple copy-paste error.
  4. **Similar commits without CVEs**: The reference commits shown (e.g., fixing sleep clock frequencies, correcting #clock-cells properties) are all device tree configuration fixes without security implications, and none were assigned CVEs.
  This is a straightforward functional fix for a device tree configuration error that prevents proper UART operation, with no security implications whatsoever.
28f997b89967a arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: Fix CPU7 opp table
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a simple typo in the CPU7 OPP table where the `opp-hz` value (1708800000) didn't match the OPP node name (opp-1747200000). This is a configuration error that:
  1. **Does not introduce a security vulnerability** - It's a frequency configuration mismatch that causes the CPU frequency scaling to fail for one specific operating point (1747.2 MHz).
  2. **Has limited impact** - The error message shows "Voltage update failed freq=1747200" which means the system cannot set CPU7 to this specific frequency. The CPU can still operate at other frequencies in the OPP table.
  3. **Is not exploitable** - This is a device tree configuration error that prevents proper frequency scaling at one operating point. It doesn't create any security holes, privilege escalation opportunities, or data exposure risks.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits** - Looking at the similar commits provided, they all fix device tree configuration issues (compatible strings, frequency values, idle state compatibles) and none were assigned CVEs.
  The commit simply corrects the frequency value from 1708800000 to 1747200000 to match the OPP node name, allowing proper CPU frequency scaling at that operating point.
778dc0f876c70 arm64: dts: qcom: sm8750: Fix cluster hierarchy for idle states
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes are purely correctional to the device tree idle state hierarchy configuration and do not fix any security vulnerability. Specifically:
  1. The commit fixes an incorrect mapping where all CPUs (0-7) were mapped to a single cluster power domain when the hardware actually has two separate clusters (CPU 0-5 in cluster0, CPU 6-7 in cluster1).
  2. This is a functional correctness fix for power management/idle states, not a security issue. The incorrect configuration would potentially prevent proper power domain sleep states from being achieved, which is a power efficiency/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. Similar to the analyzed commits with "CVE Status: NO", this is a device tree configuration fix that adjusts hardware descriptions (like commits 1-3, 5 in the reference list which fix compatible strings, add missing properties, or adjust timing parameters).
  4. Unlike commit 4 which had "CVE Status: YES" and fixed timing/latency issues that could cause system instability, reboots, and lockups, this commit does not describe any such stability or security impacts. The commit message only mentions achieving "complete domain sleep state" which is about power management efficiency.
  5. There's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, denial of service, or any other security-relevant impact from the incorrect cluster mapping.
c87d58bc7f831 arm64: dts: qcom: ipq9574: fix the msi interrupt numbers of pcie3
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree configuration fix that corrects MSI interrupt numbers for the PCIe3 controller on the IPQ9574 platform. The change replaces duplicate interrupt numbers (126, 128-130, 137, 141-143) that were incorrectly shared with PCIe2 with unique interrupt numbers (221, 222, 225, 312, 326, 415, 494, 495).
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The incorrect interrupt numbers caused a functional issue where the QDSP6 processor on the PCIe endpoint failed to initialize properly. This is a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability. There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Denial of service beyond the intended functionality not working
  3. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects systems using the IPQ9574 SoC with PCIe3 controller and specifically when trying to bring up a QDSP6 processor on the PCIe endpoint. The impact is confined to hardware initialization failure.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (sc7280 MSI additions, x1e80100 GPIO/interconnect fixes) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" and are also device tree configuration fixes without security implications.
  5. **No attack vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause harm beyond the PCIe endpoint not functioning as intended.
  The commit is a straightforward hardware configuration fix that resolves a functional issue without any security implications.
75eefd474469a arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Reenable crypto & cryptobam
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The changes fix a functional boot-time issue where the system would crash during BAM DMA initialization due to accessing hardware registers without proper interconnect power management. 
  The key evidence:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The crash occurs during legitimate driver initialization in kernel space, not due to any security boundary violation or unauthorized access
  2. **Hardware initialization bug**: The issue is that the driver tried to read configuration registers (BAM_REVISION) without the interconnect being powered on, causing a system abort
  3. **Boot-time only**: This crash only happens during device probe at boot time, not during runtime operation, and cannot be triggered by unprivileged users
  4. **Workaround nature**: The fix simply provides hardcoded values in the device tree to avoid reading from hardware registers, working around the power management issue
  While the crash could technically be considered a denial of service, it's a hardware initialization failure that occurs predictably during boot on affected devices, not an exploitable vulnerability. This is similar to the other non-CVE commits shown as examples, which also involve device tree fixes for hardware configuration issues.
fb5fce873b952 arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-starqltechn: remove excess reserved gpios
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the related context:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The change is purely a device tree cleanup that removes excess reserved GPIO ranges that were incorrectly specified. The commit:
  1. **Removes non-existent reservations**: The original device tree had reserved GPIO ranges `<0 4>` and `<81 4>` that don't actually need to be reserved on the Samsung Galaxy S9 (starqltechn) device
  2. **Keeps legitimate reservations**: The ranges `<27 4>` and `<85 4>` are retained because they are actually used for SPI interfaces (embedded Secure Element and fingerprint reader)
  3. **No security vulnerability fixed**: This is a correctness fix, not a security fix. Having extra reserved GPIOs doesn't create a security vulnerability - it just prevents those GPIOs from being used when they could be available
  4. **No exploitation path**: There's no way an attacker could exploit having extra GPIOs marked as reserved. This just limits functionality unnecessarily
  The gpio-reserved-ranges property tells the kernel which GPIO pins should not be touched because they're either protected by hardware security mechanisms or used for specific purposes. Having too many reserved is overly restrictive but not a security issue.
cba1dd3d851eb arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-starqltechn: refactor node order
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is a simple cosmetic refactoring that only reorders two property declarations in a device tree file:
  1. **Nature of change**: The commit only swaps the order of `pinctrl-names` and `pinctrl-0` properties in the `&sdhc_2` node. The original order was:
     ```
     pinctrl-names = "default";
     pinctrl-0 = <&sdc2_clk_state...>;
     ```
     And it became:
     ```
     pinctrl-0 = <&sdc2_clk_state...>;
     pinctrl-names = "default";
     ```
  2. **No security impact**: This is purely a stylistic/formatting change with no functional impact. In device tree files, the order of properties within a node does not affect functionality or security. Both properties are still present with the same values.
  3. **No vulnerability fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is a "refactor node order" - it's not fixing any bug, vulnerability, or security issue. It's just reorganizing code for consistency or style preferences.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: The reference commits provided show similar device tree changes (updating values, dropping properties, etc.) that were all marked as "CVE Status: NO", confirming that device tree formatting changes don't warrant CVEs.
  5. **No sensitive components affected**: While this touches SD card configuration, it doesn't change any security-relevant settings like access control, memory boundaries, or input validation.
242e4126ee007 arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-starqltechn: fix usb regulator mistake
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change is a simple hardware configuration fix for a device tree, correcting a regulator assignment mistake. Specifically:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit changes which regulator label (`vdda_usb1_ss_core`) is aliased to which physical regulator. It moves the alias from `vreg_l1a_0p875` (0.875V) to `vreg_l5a_0p8` (0.8V).
  2. **No security vulnerability**: This is purely a hardware description error in the device tree. The wrong regulator assignment would likely cause USB functionality issues or hardware instability, but does not introduce any security vulnerability such as:
     - No privilege escalation
     - No memory corruption
     - No access control bypass
     - No information disclosure
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (commits 1-5) all fix regulator assignments in device trees and none were assigned CVEs. They follow the same pattern of correcting power supply configurations.
  4. **Impact limited to specific hardware**: This only affects the Samsung Galaxy S9 (starqltechn) device specifically, and the issue is a functional correctness problem rather than a security issue.
  The commit is a routine hardware configuration fix that ensures the USB controller receives power from the correct voltage regulator, which is essential for proper operation but has no security implications.
2d3dd4b237638 arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845-starqltechn: remove wifi
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a device tree configuration fix that removes an incorrectly enabled WiFi device node. The commit message clearly states that the Samsung Galaxy S9 (starqltechn) uses a Broadcom WiFi chip, not the Qualcomm wcn3990 chip that was being configured.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The change simply removes configuration for hardware that doesn't exist on this device:
     - Removes power supply configurations (`vdd-0.8-cx-mx-supply`, `vdd-1.8-xo-supply`, etc.)
     - Removes the `status = "okay"` that was enabling the wrong WiFi hardware
  3. **Hardware configuration issue**: This is a device tree misconfiguration where the wrong WiFi hardware was specified. The device has Broadcom WiFi hardware but was configured to enable Qualcomm wcn3990 WiFi. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) show device tree fixes for hardware configuration issues - removing incorrect MSM IDs, disabling problematic debug components, updating firmware paths, etc. None of these were assigned CVEs because they're hardware configuration corrections, not security fixes.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: Having the wrong WiFi hardware enabled in the device tree would likely just result in non-functional WiFi or driver errors, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
  This is a routine device tree correction to properly represent the actual hardware present on the device.
0783c8b3c06b9 arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100-romulus: Keep L12B and L15B always on
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change adds `regulator-always-on` properties to two power regulators (L12B and L15B) in the device tree for the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7. This is a hardware enablement/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
  Key reasons:
  1. **No security boundary crossed**: The change simply ensures certain voltage regulators remain powered on, preventing potential hardware glitches
  2. **Hardware configuration issue**: This fixes a device tree misconfiguration where regulators powering onboard components could potentially be turned off
  3. **No exploitable vulnerability**: There's no attack vector, privilege escalation, or security impact from this issue
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" also involve regulator/power supply fixes in device trees, establishing a pattern that such changes don't warrant CVEs
  The commit message indicates these regulators are "most likely kept online by other pieces of firmware," suggesting this is a preventive stability measure rather than fixing an actual security issue.
f22be5c1dd3e1 arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: add missing cpu-cfg interconnect path in the mdss node
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. The bindings (lines 31-39) require TWO interconnect paths:
  1. `mdp0-mem` - path from mdp0 port to the data bus
  2. `cpu-cfg` - path from CPU to the reg bus
  But the previous commit (9fa33cbca3d2) only had one interconnect path (mdp0-mem). Let me analyze the security implications.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Configuration/Compliance Issue**: This is a device tree configuration issue where a required interconnect path (`cpu-cfg`) was missing. The commit message explicitly states it's to "fix the dtbs check error" and ensure proper bandwidth allocation for register writes.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The missing interconnect path doesn't introduce a security vulnerability. It's a hardware description issue that affects:
     - Device tree validation/compliance
     - Proper bandwidth allocation for CPU to write configuration registers
     - System performance/stability
  3. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits (1-5) with "CVE Status: NO" are also device tree fixes that:
     - Add missing compatible strings
     - Fix interconnect paths
     - Correct hardware descriptions
     - None introduce security vulnerabilities
  4. **No Attack Vector**: There's no exploitable security issue here. The missing path could potentially cause:
     - Bandwidth issues when HLOS (High Level OS) writes config registers
     - Performance degradation
     - But not memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues
  5. **Hardware Description**: Device tree files describe hardware configuration to the kernel. Missing descriptions can cause functional issues but don't create security vulnerabilities unless they lead to improper access control or memory safety issues, which is not the case here.
  The commit is a routine device tree fix to ensure proper hardware description and bandwidth allocation, similar to the other non-CVE commits shown as references.
327d489d1ecaf arm64: dts: qcom: sm8550: add missing cpu-cfg interconnect path in the mdss node
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This is a device tree configuration fix that adds a missing interconnect path (`cpu-cfg`) to ensure the MDSS (Mobile Display SubSystem) has proper bandwidth allocation for configuration register writes.
  2. **Functional/correctness issue**: The commit message states it fixes a "dtbs check error" and ensures "MDSS has enough bandwidth to let HLOS write config registers." This is about ensuring proper functionality, not fixing a security vulnerability.
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: The pattern is similar to the reference commits provided (all marked as NO CVE), which also deal with device tree fixes, compatible string additions, and interconnect path corrections.
  4. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit doesn't fix any of the typical security-relevant issues like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypasses
     - Information disclosure
  5. **Configuration completeness**: The change simply adds a second interconnect path that was already defined in the bindings but missing from the device tree. The driver code already handles this path gracefully - if it's not present, it continues without error (see line 65-67 in msm_mdss.c).
  The interconnect paths are used for bandwidth management to ensure components can communicate properly, but the absence of the cpu-cfg path doesn't create a security vulnerability - it would at most cause functional issues with display configuration.
54df5e52777e1 arm64: dts: qcom: sm8550: use ICC tag for all interconnect phandles
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes are purely cosmetic/stylistic improvements to the device tree source (DTS) file for the Qualcomm SM8550 platform. Specifically:
  1. **Nature of changes**: The commit replaces hardcoded `0` values in interconnect phandle definitions with the symbolic constant `QCOM_ICC_TAG_ALWAYS`. This is a code cleanup that improves readability and maintainability without changing functionality.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes don't fix any security vulnerability. They simply replace magic numbers with named constants, which is a best practice in programming but has no security implications.
  3. **Device tree context**: These changes are in the device tree configuration, which defines hardware topology and configuration. The interconnect tags being modified are used for bandwidth voting and power management - replacing `0` with `QCOM_ICC_TAG_ALWAYS` maintains the same behavior.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (sm8250, sm8350, x1e80100, sa8775p), none of them were assigned CVEs, and they follow similar patterns of DTS cleanup or configuration adjustments.
  5. **Commit message clarity**: The commit message clearly states this is about using "proper QCOM_ICC_TAG_ define instead of passing 0" - indicating this is a code quality improvement, not a security fix.
cdc117c40537c arm64: dts: qcom: qcs8300: Partially revert "arm64: dts: qcom: qcs8300: add QCrypto nodes"
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security fix**: This commit is removing a device tree node due to device tree binding validation failures, not fixing any security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's a partial revert due to "devicetree bindings test failures."
  2. **No security impact**: The removal of the QCE (Qualcomm Crypto Engine) hardware node does not create or fix any security vulnerabilities. It simply removes hardware crypto acceleration support that wasn't properly configured according to the device tree bindings.
  3. **Alternative crypto remains**: The ICE (Inline Crypto Engine) at address 0x1d88000 remains in the device tree, providing hardware crypto support for storage operations. Additionally, software crypto implementations are always available as fallback.
  4. **Configuration issue only**: The issue is that the compatible string "qcom,qcs8300-qce" is not properly defined in the device tree bindings schema. This is a documentation/configuration compliance issue, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Like the similar commits provided (which all have CVE Status: NO), this is a device tree cleanup/fix commit addressing binding compliance issues, not security vulnerabilities.
  The code changes show only the removal of the crypto@1dfa000 node while keeping the cryptobam DMA controller and ICE crypto engine intact. This is purely a technical cleanup to resolve validation errors in the device tree, with no security implications.
92979f12a201c arm64: dts: qcom: sa8775p: Partially revert "arm64: dts: qcom: sa8775p: add QCrypto nodes"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security fix**: This is a partial revert that removes an untested device tree node for a crypto device (QCE - Qualcomm Crypto Engine) that was causing devicetree binding test failures.
  2. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message clearly states the reason for removal is "devicetree bindings test failures" - not any security vulnerability. The compatible string 'qcom,sa8775p-qce' was not recognized in the bindings schema.
  3. **Device tree configuration issue**: The issue is purely a device tree configuration/compatibility problem where the sa8775p-specific compatible string wasn't defined in the devicetree bindings, causing validation failures.
  4. **No security impact**: Removing an untested crypto device node that wasn't properly integrated doesn't fix any security vulnerability. The crypto engine itself (if it were properly configured) would provide crypto acceleration, not introduce vulnerabilities.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the pattern of the similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) which fix device tree compatibility issues, update firmware nodes, or correct compatible strings - none of which are security-related.
  The commit is a housekeeping change to maintain proper devicetree validation, not a security fix.
2250f65b32565 arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: setup gpu thermal with higher temperatures
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Configuration adjustment, not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is adjusting thermal trip points for GPU temperature monitoring from 85°C/90°C/110°C to 95°C/110°C/115°C. This is a configuration change to optimize thermal management, not fixing a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The changes only modify temperature thresholds in device tree files. There's no code execution vulnerability, privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access control bypass being fixed.
  3. **Purpose is optimization**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "achieve a much higher temperature before failing" and to align with "reference downstream implementation." This is about performance optimization and preventing premature thermal throttling, not preventing a security issue.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits shown (with CVE Status: NO) are also thermal configuration adjustments - adding thermal zones, adjusting trip points, or removing polling delays. None were assigned CVEs because they don't fix security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Critical temperature still enforced**: The change maintains thermal protection with a critical trip point at 115°C (increased from 110°C), which is still below the hardware's maximum threshold of 120°C mentioned in the commit message. The thermal protection mechanisms remain intact.
  The commit is fixing a configuration issue where the thermal limits were set too conservatively compared to what the hardware can safely handle, but this doesn't constitute a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
45bd6ff900cfe arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Mark usb_2 as dma-coherent
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The change adds the `dma-coherent` property to the `usb_2_dwc3` controller to make it consistent with other USB controllers on the same platform (usb_1_ss0_dwc3, usb_1_ss1_dwc3, and usb_1_ss2_dwc3).
  2. **Configuration consistency issue**: This is a device tree configuration fix for consistency. The commit message explicitly states it's to "Make this USB controller consistent with the others on this platform."
  3. **No security impact**: Missing the `dma-coherent` property when the hardware is actually DMA coherent would typically result in:
     - Performance degradation (unnecessary cache maintenance operations)
     - Potential functional issues in some scenarios
     - But not a security vulnerability that could be exploited
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits shown (adding interrupt descriptions, marking ethernet devices as DMA-coherent, fixing USB interrupt mappings) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are hardware description fixes, not security vulnerability fixes.
  5. **Nature of the fix**: The `dma-coherent` property tells the kernel whether the device can perform DMA operations that are cache-coherent with the CPU. This is a hardware capability declaration, not a security boundary fix.
  This is a functional correctness fix for device tree configuration, not a security vulnerability fix.
9883494c45a13 f2fs: fix to correct check conditions in f2fs_cross_rename
- [sasha] Now I understand the bug and its security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Logic error, not security vulnerability**: The bug is a copy-paste error where `new_dir` was incorrectly used instead of `old_dir` in the second part of the condition. This causes incorrect enforcement of project quota restrictions during cross-rename (RENAME_EXCHANGE) operations.
  2. **No security boundary bypass**: The bug makes the check either too restrictive or incorrectly restrictive, but it doesn't allow bypassing security boundaries. The worst case is that:
     - It might incorrectly deny a valid cross-rename operation
     - It might check the wrong directory's project inheritance flag
     
  3. **Project quotas are administrative controls**: Project quotas in filesystems are primarily used for resource management and accounting, not as a security mechanism. They help track disk usage by projects but aren't a security enforcement boundary.
  4. **No privilege escalation or data corruption**: The fix doesn't prevent any data corruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access. It simply corrects which directory's FI_PROJ_INHERIT flag is checked in the second condition.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE examples**: Looking at the similar commits provided, simple logic fixes and typo corrections (like Similar Commit 2, 3, 4, and 5) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", while only the commit that fixed actual filesystem corruption (Similar Commit 1 - dirent corruption) was assigned a CVE.
  The bug is a simple logic error in project quota inheritance checking that doesn't create any security vulnerabilities - it just makes the quota restriction check incorrect but not in a way that compromises system security.
a6c397a31f58a f2fs: use d_inode(dentry) cleanup dentry->d_inode
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and additional context from the Linux kernel tree, I can now provide my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure cleanup commit**: The commit message explicitly states "no logic changes" and describes it as a "cleanup". The changes simply replace direct `dentry->d_inode` access with the `d_inode(dentry)` helper function.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The changes don't fix any security issues. In the specific code locations modified:
     - The dentries are guaranteed to be valid with proper VFS locking
     - These are not RCU-walk contexts where race conditions could occur
     - The code already had proper inode references (e.g., `struct inode *old_inode = d_inode(old_dentry)`)
  3. **Code refactoring only**: In `fs/f2fs/namei.c`, the changes actually use already-computed inode variables instead of re-accessing through the dentry, which is just good coding practice. In `fs/f2fs/super.c`, it's a straightforward replacement of direct access with the helper function.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits #1, #2, and #3 were also cleanups or refactoring changes marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern.
  5. **Part of broader VFS modernization**: This appears to be part of the kernel-wide effort to use VFS helper functions instead of direct structure member access, which improves code maintainability but doesn't address any security issues.
  The commit is a routine code cleanup that improves code consistency and follows modern kernel coding practices, but it does not fix any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
c836d3b8d94e3 f2fs: fix to skip f2fs_balance_fs() if checkpoint is disabled
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I'll provide my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a deadlock/hang issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit message describes a scenario where the system gets into a deadlock state with these conditions:
     - Checkpoint is disabled
     - GC (garbage collection) is needed
     - A freeze operation is in progress
     
  2. **Impact Analysis**: 
     - The issue causes a task to block indefinitely (hung task), which is a denial of service
     - However, this requires specific mount options (`gc_merge,checkpoint=disable`) and a specific sequence of operations
     - The deadlock occurs between normal filesystem operations and administrative actions (freeze/shutdown)
  3. **Exploitability**:
     - This is not exploitable by unprivileged users
     - It requires mounting with specific options and performing shutdown operations
     - The race condition requires specific timing between fallocate, shutdown, and GC threads
  4. **Code Changes**:
     - The fix simply changes from `!f2fs_is_checkpoint_ready(sbi)` to `is_sbi_flag_set(sbi, SBI_CP_DISABLED)`
     - This is a logic fix to prevent entering GC when checkpoint is disabled
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data integrity issues are involved
  5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**:
     - Unlike the CVE-assigned commits shown (use-after-free, accessing uninitialized memory), this is just a deadlock
     - The CVE-assigned examples involve memory safety issues that could potentially be exploited
     - This commit only fixes a hang condition under specific circumstances
  The issue is a quality/reliability bug rather than a security vulnerability. While it can cause system unavailability, it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it doesn't involve memory safety, privilege boundaries, or data confidentiality/integrity violations.
57a92d14659df net: phy: mscc: Stop clearing the the UDPv4 checksum for L2 frames
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The commit fixes a data corruption issue where the PHY hardware was incorrectly clearing 2 bytes (corresponding to the UDP checksum field) in Layer 2 (L2) Ethernet frames when PTP timestamping was enabled. This happened because the IP/UDP configuration was being applied even for L2 frames.
  2. **Security implications**: While this is a data corruption bug, it does not represent a security vulnerability:
     - It's not exploitable by an attacker
     - It doesn't cause privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service
     - It's a functional bug that affects PTP timestamp accuracy in L2 frames
     - The corruption is limited to modifying 2 bytes in certain frames, which typically results in frame drops or timestamp inaccuracy
  3. **Code analysis**: The fix adds a conditional check (`if (enable)`) before setting `IP1_NXT_PROT_UDP_CHKSUM_CLEAR`, ensuring that UDP checksum clearing is only enabled when actually processing L4 (Layer 4/UDP) frames, not L2 frames. The function `vsc85xx_ip1_conf` is called with `enable` set based on whether `ptp_l4` is true, which correctly identifies L4 vs L2 traffic.
  4. **Impact scope**: This affects only systems using:
     - MSCC/Microchip PHYs with PTP timestamping enabled
     - L2 PTP frames (Ethernet-level timestamping)
     - A specific hardware configuration
  This is a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The commit message accurately describes it as fixing frame modification that causes userspace to potentially ignore frames or get incorrect timestamps, but there's no security boundary violation or exploitable condition.
0bdc924bfb319 net: openvswitch: Fix the dead loop of MPLS parse
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes an infinite loop vulnerability that causes a soft lockup/CPU stuck condition. This is a clear denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability where a specially crafted MPLS packet can cause the kernel to hang.
  2. **Root Cause**: The vulnerability occurs because `label_count` is declared as `u8` (unsigned 8-bit integer). When processing malformed MPLS packets without a proper bottom-of-stack marker, the loop continues incrementing `label_count`. When it reaches 255 and increments again, it wraps around to 0 due to integer overflow.
  3. **Array Out-of-Bounds Access**: The UBSAN warning shows "index -1 is out of range for type '__be32 [3]'". This happens because:
     - When `label_count` wraps to 0, the code executes `key->mpls.lse[label_count - 1]`
     - This evaluates to `key->mpls.lse[-1]`, causing an out-of-bounds array access
  4. **Fix**: The patch changes `label_count` from `u8` to `size_t`, preventing the integer overflow and subsequent wraparound that leads to the infinite loop and out-of-bounds access.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the pattern of the example CVE commits shown:
     - It fixes an out-of-bounds access vulnerability
     - It involves array index validation issues
     - It can be triggered by malformed network packets
     - It causes system instability (soft lockup)
  The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted MPLS packets to a system running Open vSwitch, making it a security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
6e9f2df1c550e calipso: Don't call calipso functions for AF_INET sk.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a null pointer dereference that leads to a kernel crash (general protection fault). This is a clear security vulnerability.
  2. **Remote Triggerable**: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by a malicious user through the socket connect() system call, making it a remotely exploitable issue.
  3. **Missing Security Validation**: The root cause is missing validation in `netlbl_conn_setattr()` which fails to check if the address family passed from userspace matches the socket family. This allows connecting an IPv6 address to an IPv4 socket, leading to the crash.
  4. **Crash Details**: When `calipso_sock_setattr()` is called on an IPv4 socket:
     - `inet6_sk(sk)` returns `inet_sk(sk)->pinet6`
     - For IPv4 sockets, `pinet6` is NULL
     - This NULL value is then passed to `txopt_get()` which dereferences it at offset 0x70
     - This causes a kernel crash with null-ptr-deref
  5. **Security Impact**: This vulnerability allows unprivileged users to crash the kernel, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.
  6. **Pattern Similarity**: This follows a similar pattern to the other CVE-assigned commits shown as examples - they all fix null pointer dereferences in networking code that can be triggered by userspace.
  The fix is simple but critical - adding a check `if (sk->sk_family != AF_INET6)` before processing IPv6-specific CALIPSO operations prevents the null pointer dereference.
67af4ec948e8c octeontx2-pf: QOS: Refactor TC_HTB_LEAF_DEL_LAST callback
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fixes**: The commit addresses two issues:
     - Issue 1: A race condition where active traffic needs to be stopped before reassigning a send queue
     - Issue 2: A warning during system reboot about queue registration after device unregistration
  2. **Impact assessment**:
     - Issue 1: The fix adds `WRITE_ONCE(node->qid, OTX2_QOS_QID_INNER)` before disabling the send queue. This marks the node as "inner" (non-leaf) to prevent traffic from using it while it's being reassigned. This is a correctness issue that could potentially cause packet drops or misdirection, but doesn't appear to be exploitable for privilege escalation or system compromise.
     
     - Issue 2: The removal of `otx2_qos_update_tx_netdev_queues(pfvf)` prevents a harmless warning during system shutdown. This is purely a cosmetic/logging issue with no security implications.
  3. **Security implications**: Neither issue presents:
     - Memory corruption possibilities
     - Privilege escalation vectors
     - Information disclosure risks
     - Denial of service beyond temporary packet loss
     - Remote exploitability
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involved actual resource leaks (transmit scheduler resources not being freed)
     - This commit is more about proper ordering/synchronization and preventing a benign warning
  The changes are functional improvements for edge cases (traffic handling during queue reassignment and system shutdown) rather than security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.
479c58016099d octeontx2-pf: QOS: Perform cache sync on send queue teardown
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context gathered from the kernel tree, I can now provide my assessment.
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes SMMU (System Memory Management Unit) errors that occur during QoS send queue teardown when queues are created and deleted in a loop. While this is an important bug fix, it does not represent a security vulnerability for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The issue requires local privileged access (CAP_NET_ADMIN) to configure QoS queues, significantly limiting the attack vector.
  2. **No Memory Corruption or Privilege Escalation**: The SMMU errors indicate translation/permission faults due to missing cache synchronization, not exploitable memory corruption. The fix adds `otx2_qos_nix_npa_ndc_sync()` to properly synchronize the NIX/NPA NDC caches during teardown.
  3. **DoS Impact Only**: The worst-case scenario is a local Denial of Service through system instability, which already requires elevated privileges to trigger.
  4. **Functional Bug**: This is primarily a driver reliability issue where the missing cache synchronization (`DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC` was used in the original code) causes SMMU to see inconsistent memory state during rapid queue creation/deletion cycles.
  The fix properly synchronizes the hardware caches by adding the NDC sync operation, ensuring the SMMU sees a consistent memory state during queue teardown. This is a stability improvement rather than a security fix.
846992645b25e net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Clear Security Impact - Memory Leak**: The commit fixes a memory leak vulnerability where SKBs (socket buffers) accumulate indefinitely in the `tx_queue` when using one-step timestamping mode. This can lead to memory exhaustion over time.
  2. **Exploitable Condition**: The vulnerability is triggered whenever PTP one-step timestamping is enabled (`HWTSTAMP_TX_ONESTEP_SYNC`) and SYNC packets are transmitted. Since PTP SYNC messages are sent periodically (typically every 1-2 seconds), this creates a continuous memory leak.
  3. **Root Cause**: The bug occurs because:
     - In one-step mode, the hardware inserts timestamps directly into SYNC frames without saving them to the FIFO
     - The driver still queues these SKBs expecting a timestamp callback that will never occur
     - The `vsc85xx_dequeue_skb()` function cannot match these SKBs since no FIFO entry exists
     - SKBs remain in the queue forever, leaking memory
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned Issues**: Looking at the historical commits:
     - Similar Commit 3 (at86rf230 SKB leak) was assigned a CVE
     - Similar Commit 4 (mse102x double free) was assigned a CVE  
     - Similar Commit 5 (mt7915 memory leak) was assigned a CVE
     - All these commits fix memory management issues with SKBs
  5. **Long-standing Issue**: The vulnerability has existed since the initial implementation in commit 7d272e63e0979d ("net: phy: mscc: timestamping and PHC support"), making it present in multiple kernel versions.
  The fix properly handles the one-step timestamping case by immediately freeing SYNC SKBs instead of queuing them, preventing the memory leak.
82d1096ca8b5d net: lan743x: Fix PHY reset handling during initialization and WOL
- [sasha] 
68927eb52d0af net: lan743x: rename lan743x_reset_phy to lan743x_hw_reset_phy
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Pure Function Rename**: The commit only renames a function from `lan743x_reset_phy` to `lan743x_hw_reset_phy`. This is a cosmetic change to improve code clarity and does not modify any functionality.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The function performs a hardware PHY reset by setting the `PMT_CTL_ETH_PHY_RST_` bit and waiting for it to clear. The rename doesn't change this behavior or introduce any security vulnerabilities.
  3. **Comment Confirms Usage**: The existing comment "Only called with in probe, and before mdiobus_register" remains unchanged, indicating the function's limited scope during device initialization.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they involve actual functional changes like:
     - Wake-on-LAN support modifications
     - MAC address handling changes  
     - PHY link state fixes
     - Hardware reset improvements
  This commit, in contrast, is purely a naming improvement with no functional changes whatsoever. The "Fixes:" tag appears to be used here to indicate which commit originally introduced the function being renamed, not to fix any actual bug or security issue.
e9cb929670a1e net: phy: fix up const issues in to_mdio_device() and to_phy_device()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is purely a code quality improvement that fixes const-correctness issues. The commit message explicitly states it's fixing "const issues" where the previous implementation was "throwing away" const qualifiers.
  2. **Type Safety Enhancement, Not Security Fix**: The change replaces `container_of()` with `container_of_const()` to preserve const-correctness. This is a compile-time type safety improvement that helps prevent accidental modification of const objects, but it doesn't fix any runtime security vulnerability.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The previous code wasn't creating any memory corruption, buffer overflow, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities. It was simply not preserving const qualifiers properly, which is a code quality issue rather than a security issue.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 2 (moving phy_link_change function) - marked NO CVE - was also a code organization change
     - Similar Commit 3 (OF node reference leak fix) - marked NO CVE - was a resource leak in error paths
  5. **The Fixes Commit Context**: The referenced commit (7eab14de73a8) was fixing compiler warnings about variable shadowing when nested container_of() macros were used. The current commit is following up on that by improving const-correctness, which is a code quality improvement, not a security fix.
  Unlike the CVE-assigned commits in the examples (which fixed actual memory leaks that could lead to resource exhaustion), this commit only improves type safety at compile time without addressing any runtime security issues.
126cd7852a62c net: mctp: start tx queue on netdev open
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the information provided:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Bug Type**: This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that the TX queue is not restarted after a network interface down/up cycle, which prevents packet transmission after the interface comes back up.
  2. **Code Analysis**: The fix simply adds `netif_start_queue(dev);` in the `mctp_usb_open()` function. This is the standard pattern for network drivers - queues should be stopped in `ndo_stop` and restarted in `ndo_open`.
  3. **Impact**: The bug causes a denial of service in the sense that packets cannot be transmitted after interface cycling, but this is:
     - Not exploitable by an attacker
     - Requires administrative privileges to bring the interface down/up
     - Only affects functionality, not security boundaries
     - Can be worked around by reloading the driver
  4. **Pattern Recognition**: Looking at similar commits in the provided examples:
     - Similar Commit 1 (idpf driver) - NO CVE: Fixed queue stop/wake logic issues
     - Similar Commit 2 (mctp i3c) - NO CVE: Fixed race condition with mutex
     - Similar Commit 3 (mcp251x) - YES CVE: Fixed NULL dereference that could crash the system
     - Similar Commit 4 (netdev_tx) - NO CVE: Fixed timing issues in watchdog
     - Similar Commit 5 (mptcp) - NO CVE: Cleanup of redundant code
  5. **Security Criteria**: This bug does not meet CVE criteria because:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No remote exploitation
     - No system crash/panic
     - Just a functional issue requiring admin action to trigger
  This is a standard driver bug fix that ensures proper queue management across interface state transitions, similar to many other non-CVE network driver fixes.
c59783780c8ad net: airoha: Fix an error handling path in airoha_alloc_gdm_port()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Error Path Memory Leak**: The issue is a memory leak that only occurs in the error handling path during device probe when `register_netdev()` fails. This is not exploitable by an attacker.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The memory leak happens only during driver initialization failure, not during normal operation. It requires the specific condition where:
     - `airoha_metadata_dst_alloc()` succeeds
     - `register_netdev()` fails
     - The probe function error path is taken
  3. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This is a resource leak bug, not a security vulnerability. Looking at the similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) fixed a resource leak but was exploitable during runtime operations
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: YES) fixed a memory leak in a network path that could be triggered during normal operation
     
     This commit differs because it's only triggered during probe failure, not during normal runtime.
  4. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds proper cleanup in the error path:
     ```c
     err = register_netdev(dev);
     if (err)
         goto free_metadata_dst;
     
     free_metadata_dst:
         airoha_metadata_dst_free(port);
     ```
     
     This is a straightforward resource management fix in an initialization error path.
  5. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an unprivileged user to trigger this leak - it only happens if the kernel itself fails to register the network device during driver probe, which is a system-level initialization event.
  This is a quality improvement fix for proper resource cleanup, not a security vulnerability fix.
0795b05a59b13 net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here's my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The commit fixes a crash caused by a NULL pointer dereference in `device_link_del()`. The crash log shows `device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120` in the call trace, indicating the kernel tried to access invalid memory.
  2. **Use-after-free pattern**: The bug exhibits a classic use-after-free pattern where `phydev->devlink` retains a stale pointer after `device_link_del()` is called. When the device is re-attached and fails, the error path calls `phy_detach()` again, which tries to delete an already-freed device link.
  3. **Exploitable crash scenario**: The vulnerability can be triggered by:
     - Disabling a network port (calls `phy_detach()` which deletes the device link but doesn't clear `phydev->devlink`)
     - Re-enabling the network port where `phy_attach_direct()` fails before reaching the `device_link_add()` call
     - The error path calls `phy_detach()` again, causing `device_link_del()` to use the stale pointer
  4. **Security impact**: This can lead to kernel crashes (DoS) and potentially memory corruption. The crash is reproducible through normal network operations (disabling/enabling network ports), making it accessible to users with network configuration privileges.
  5. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown, particularly commit 3 which also dealt with NULL pointer dereferences in the ethtool/phy subsystem when accessing uninitialized or stale pointers.
  The fix is minimal and correct - it simply clears `phydev->devlink` after deletion to prevent the use-after-free condition.
e2d2115e56c4a bpf: Do not include stack ptr register in precision backtracking bookkeeping
- [sasha] Now let me understand the security implications by analyzing the warning message and the fix:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a verifier internal consistency check failure (WARN_ONCE) that triggers when the BPF verifier's precision backtracking logic incorrectly includes the r10 (stack pointer) register in its bookkeeping. The warning at line 4302 checks that only r1-r5 registers should be marked for precision tracking when exiting a subprogram.
  2. **No security impact**: 
     - The bug causes a warning and returns `-EFAULT`, which means the BPF program is rejected by the verifier
     - There's no exploitation path - the verifier correctly catches the issue and refuses to load the problematic BPF program
     - The WARN_ONCE is a defensive check that prevents incorrect verifier state, not a vulnerability
  3. **Code analysis**: The fix adds flags (`INSN_F_DST_REG_STACK` and `INSN_F_SRC_REG_STACK`) to track when conditional jumps involve the stack pointer, preventing r10 from being incorrectly added to precision tracking in `backtrack_insn()`. This is a correctness fix, not a security fix.
  4. **Similar to rejected CVEs**: This is similar to the commits marked "CVE Status: NO" in the reference list - it's a verifier bug that causes program rejection rather than allowing unsafe programs to load. The verifier's conservative behavior (rejecting the program) prevents any security issues.
  The key distinction is that this bug makes the verifier overly restrictive (rejecting valid programs), not overly permissive (allowing unsafe programs), which is why it doesn't warrant a CVE.
86bc9c742426a bpf: Avoid __bpf_prog_ret0_warn when jit fails
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what I understand from the code:
  **NO**
  This commit should **NOT** be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a logic bug that causes a WARN_ON_ONCE() to trigger incorrectly, but it does not represent a security vulnerability. The warning occurs when:
     - CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON is not set
     - bpf_jit_enable is set to 1 (JIT requested)
     - JIT compilation fails (e.g., due to fault injection)
     - The program still runs but calls `__bpf_prog_ret0_warn` which triggers the warning
  2. **Security impact analysis**:
     - The function `__bpf_prog_ret0_warn` simply returns 0 and triggers a WARN_ON_ONCE(1)
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - The BPF program execution is safely handled - it just returns 0
     - This is a diagnostic/debugging issue, not a security vulnerability
  3. **Code changes**: The fix simply changes the initialization of `jit_needed` from `false` to `fp->jit_requested` to properly track whether JIT was requested, preventing the incorrect warning when JIT fails.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commits in the examples which involved:
     - Memory corruption (off-by-one errors, buffer overflows)
     - Stack depth calculation errors leading to potential crashes
     - Tail call handling issues that could cause kernel lockups
     - Input validation bugs that could cause integer overflows
     This commit merely fixes an incorrect warning message with no security implications.
  The issue is purely a logic bug in error handling that causes a spurious warning, not a security vulnerability.
9ef41ebf787fc virtio-pci: Fix result size returned for the admin command completion
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Buffer overflow vulnerability**: The bug causes `result_sg_size` to be set to a value that is 8 bytes larger than the actual data size. This happens because `virtqueue_get_buf()` returns the total size including both the data and the 8-byte `virtio_admin_cmd_status` structure, but the code treats this as if it were just the data size.
  2. **Memory safety impact**: The commit message explicitly states that "The allocated buffer in the kernel may be smaller than the returned size, leading to failures when reading beyond the allocated size." This indicates a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
  3. **Data corruption**: The bug causes "8 bytes of extra data at the end" to be included in state transfers during live migration, which could lead to data corruption or information disclosure.
  4. **Exploitable path**: The vulnerable code is reached through the virtio device migration path (`virtiovf_buf_read()` function), where `vhca_buf->length` is used to calculate how much data to copy to userspace via `copy_to_user()`. If the length includes an extra 8 bytes beyond the actual allocated buffer, this could lead to reading uninitialized or out-of-bounds memory.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows a similar pattern to the other virtio overflow fixes that were assigned CVEs (e.g., "virtio-net: fix overflow inside virtnet_rq_alloc" and "virtio-blk: fix implicit overflow on virtio_max_dma_size"), where incorrect size calculations led to buffer overflows.
  The fix properly subtracts the status structure size from the result to ensure only the actual data size is used, preventing the overflow condition.
d8d85ef0a631d af_packet: move notifier's packet_dev_mc out of rcu critical section
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. The bug involves calling sleeping functions (`dev_set_promiscuity`, `dev_set_allmulti`, etc.) from within an RCU critical section in the `packet_notifier` function, which violates kernel locking rules and can lead to kernel crashes or denial of service.
  Key evidence from the code changes:
  1. The commit moves `packet_dev_mc()` calls outside the RCU critical section by collecting entries in a list during RCU traversal, then processing them after `rcu_read_unlock()`
  2. The stack trace shows mutex locking attempts (`__mutex_lock`) being called from an atomic context, which is forbidden
  3. The fix properly separates RCU-protected list traversal from operations that may sleep
  This represents a local DoS vulnerability that can be triggered by unprivileged users through packet socket operations when network devices are being unregistered, making it a legitimate security issue requiring a CVE.
32374234ab010 net: xilinx: axienet: Fix Tx skb circular buffer occupancy check in dmaengine xmit
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit without accessing the kernel tree. Based on the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a logic error in the TX skb circular buffer occupancy check for the dmaengine transmit path. The bug is in the calculation of available space in the TX ring buffer:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The code was incorrectly multiplying by `MAX_SKB_FRAGS` when checking buffer space and wake thresholds, but in the dmaengine flow, each ring element corresponds to a complete skb (not fragments).
  2. **Code changes**:
     - In `axienet_dma_tx_cb()`: Changed `2 * MAX_SKB_FRAGS` to `2` in `netif_txq_completed_wake()`
     - In `axienet_start_xmit_dmaengine()`: Changed the space check from `<= sg_len` to `<= 1` and changed `MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1` to `1` and `2 * MAX_SKB_FRAGS` to `2` in `netif_txq_maybe_stop()`
  3. **Impact**: This is a performance/functional bug that could cause the TX queue to stop prematurely or not wake up properly, leading to degraded network performance or stalled transmissions. However, it does not create a security vulnerability:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond normal network performance issues
     - The bug is confined to queue management logic
  4. **Similar commits**: The reference commits show various fixes for the axienet driver, including memory leak fixes and packet counting fixes, none of which were assigned CVEs. These were all functional/correctness issues without security implications.
  This is a typical driver bug fix that corrects queue management logic without introducing any security vulnerabilities.
57ee9584fd860 net: lan966x: Fix 1-step timestamping over ipv4 or ipv6
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I can now provide my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The issue is that PTP timestamps are inserted at the wrong offset in UDP/IPv4/IPv6 frames, causing malformed PTP frames. This is a protocol compliance issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No remote exploitation possible**: The bug affects outgoing PTP frames generated by the local system. Remote attackers cannot trigger or exploit this issue to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or cause denial of service.
  3. **Limited impact**: The malformed frames would simply be rejected by receiving PTP implementations as invalid. This breaks PTP time synchronization functionality but doesn't cross any security boundaries.
  4. **No sensitive data exposure**: The bug doesn't leak kernel memory or expose sensitive information - it just places timestamps at incorrect offsets in outgoing frames.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, issues that fix functional bugs in timestamping (like commits 1-4) were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Only commit 5, which involved a potential crash/denial of service, received a CVE.
  The code changes show this is purely about setting the correct PDU_TYPE field (NONE for L2, IPV4, or IPV6) so the hardware knows where to insert timestamps. Without this, the hardware was inserting timestamps at the wrong offset for UDP-based PTP, but this is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
92a251c3df8ea RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the security implications:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Resource Leak Leading to DoS**: The commit fixes a reference counting bug where `cma_id_get()` is called but `cma_id_put()` is never called when `queue_work()` fails. This causes a resource leak that leads to zombie processes and system hangs.
  2. **Remote Triggerable**: The vulnerability exists in `cma_netevent_callback()`, which processes network neighbor update events. Remote attackers can trigger these events by sending crafted network packets, making this remotely exploitable without authentication.
  3. **High Security Impact**: The bug causes:
     - Zombie processes that cannot be killed
     - System resource exhaustion
     - Complete RDMA subsystem failure requiring reboot
     - Denial of Service affecting critical infrastructure
  4. **Similar to Previous CVEs**: The referenced commit (45f5dcdd0497) that this fixes was assigned a CVE for a workqueue crash. This new issue is a follow-up vulnerability in the same code path with similar security impact.
  5. **Clear Attack Vector**: The specific code shows:
     ```c
     cma_id_get(current_id);
     if (!queue_work(cma_wq, &current_id->id.net_work))
         cma_id_put(current_id);  // This was missing, causing the leak
     ```
     Without the `cma_id_put()` on failure, reference counts never reach zero, preventing cleanup and causing resource exhaustion.
  The vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service through network-triggered resource exhaustion, meeting the criteria for CVE assignment.
45ca7e9f0730a vsock/virtio: fix `rx_bytes` accounting for stream sockets
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is primarily an accounting error where `rx_bytes` wasn't properly decremented during partial reads. While this affects the accuracy of the flow control mechanism, it doesn't create a direct security vulnerability.
  2. **Limited Security Impact**: 
     - The bug causes `rx_bytes` to remain stale (higher than actual) on partial reads
     - This makes the system think it has less available buffer space than it actually does
     - This is a "fail-safe" scenario - it leads to conservative behavior (sending fewer credit updates), not excessive behavior
     - It cannot cause buffer overflows or memory exhaustion
  3. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - The similar commits that received CVEs (like the two marked "YES" in the examples) fixed issues where accounting errors could lead to memory exhaustion or buffer overflow
     - This commit fixes the opposite problem - where rx_bytes is too high, making the system more conservative
  4. **Code Analysis**:
     - The fix separates `bytes_read` from `bytes_dequeued` to maintain accurate accounting
     - The new `buf_used` field tracks actual buffer usage separately from data availability
     - These changes improve accuracy but don't close a security hole
  5. **Impact Assessment**:
     - The main impact is functional: credit updates might not be sent when they should be, potentially affecting performance
     - This could cause stalls in data transmission when SO_RCVLOWAT is set to non-default values
     - However, it doesn't enable attackers to bypass security boundaries or exhaust resources
  The commit is an important fix for correctness and performance, but it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it doesn't introduce exploitable security vulnerabilities.
ba5cb47b56e5d octeontx2-af: Send Link events one by one
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit adds `otx2_mbox_wait_for_rsp()` calls after sending mailbox messages to ensure synchronous delivery of link events. The issue being fixed is message overwriting when multiple link events are sent rapidly.
  2. **Not a security vulnerability**: The problem is a functional issue where link event messages could be overwritten before being processed by the PF (Physical Function). This is a reliability/correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit message states: "new message is overwriting the message which is being processed by PF."
  3. **No security impact**: 
     - There's no privilege escalation
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - No unauthorized access or information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond potential link event notification delays
     - The fix simply adds proper synchronization to ensure messages are processed sequentially
  4. **Similar to race condition fixes**: While this fixes a race condition in message handling, it's similar to the reference commit "octeontx2: Detect the mbox up or down message via register" which also fixed mailbox communication issues without being assigned a CVE.
  5. **Limited scope**: The impact is limited to proper delivery of link status notifications in the octeontx2 network driver. Loss or corruption of these notifications would only affect link state awareness, not system security.
  The commit is a quality/reliability improvement that ensures proper serialization of mailbox messages, but does not address any security vulnerability.
405b0d610745f net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it with the similar commits provided, I can now make a determination.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes an uninitialized value vulnerability that leads to partially initialized MAC addresses in the aqc111 USB network driver. The KMSAN report shows that `aqc111_read_perm_mac()` reads a MAC address from the device but doesn't properly verify if all bytes were read successfully.
  2. **Similar Pattern to CVE-assigned Commits**: This vulnerability follows the exact same pattern as the similar commits that were assigned CVEs:
     - Similar Commit 1 (asix driver): Fixed incomplete USB read handling where `asix_read_cmd()` could read fewer bytes than requested
     - Similar Commit 2 (smsc75xx driver): Fixed the same issue where `usbnet_read_cmd()` reads fewer bytes than requested
     - Similar Commit 3 (asix driver): Fixed uninit-value in `asix_mdio_read()`
     - Similar Commit 4 (rtl8712 driver): Fixed uninit-value when USB vendor request returns negative
  3. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds proper error checking by changing:
     ```c
     if (unlikely(ret < 0))
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     if (unlikely(ret < size)) {
         ret = ret < 0 ? ret : -ENODATA;
     ```
     This ensures that partial reads (where fewer bytes than requested are read) are properly detected and handled as errors.
  4. **Exploitability**: The vulnerability results in the MAC address buffer (`buf[ETH_ALEN]`) being only partially initialized when `aqc111_read_cmd()` reads fewer than 6 bytes. This uninitialized data is then copied to `dev->net->perm_addr` via `ether_addr_copy()` and subsequently used to set the device's MAC address. This could lead to:
     - Information disclosure (uninitialized kernel memory exposed as MAC address)
     - Network connectivity issues
     - Potential for controlled MAC address manipulation
  5. **Root Cause**: The issue occurs because `usbnet_read_cmd()` can return a positive value less than the requested size when the USB device returns fewer bytes than expected, but the aqc111 driver was only checking for negative error values.
7917be1709281 RISC-V: KVM: lock the correct mp_state during reset
- [sasha] **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  While this is indeed a locking bug where `vcpu->arch.mp_state_lock` is incorrectly used instead of `tmp->arch.mp_state_lock` in the loop, the security impact is limited:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The `kvm_riscv_vcpu_sbi_system_reset()` function is only called during SBI (Supervisor Binary Interface) system reset operations, which are privileged operations typically triggered by guest OS shutdown/reboot sequences.
  2. **Guest-Only Impact**: This bug only affects the guest VM's own vCPUs during its own reset operation. A guest cannot use this to affect other VMs or the host.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The race condition doesn't provide a path for privilege escalation or breaking VM isolation boundaries. The worst case is that some vCPUs might not be properly stopped during a guest-initiated reset.
  4. **Similar Historical Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), none of them received CVEs despite fixing various synchronization and state management issues in KVM. They were treated as regular bug fixes.
  5. **Functional Bug vs Security Vulnerability**: This is primarily a functional correctness issue. While it could potentially cause guest instability during reset operations, it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE.
  The fix is important for correctness and preventing potential guest hangs or improper reset behavior, but it doesn't represent a security boundary violation that would justify CVE assignment.
22a9613de4c29 netfilter: nft_tunnel: fix geneve_opt dump
- [sasha] ## Answer: NO
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **The issue is a serialization format bug, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes how multiple geneve options are serialized when dumping netlink attributes. The bug causes incorrect nesting of NFTA_TUNNEL_KEY_OPTS_GENEVE attributes - instead of creating a separate nested attribute for each geneve option, it was incorrectly putting all options under a single nested attribute.
  2. **No security impact**: This is purely a userspace communication issue that affects how netfilter tunnel configuration is exported back to userspace tools. The commit message clearly states "userspace tools won't be able to fetch the geneve options configured correctly" - this is a functionality bug, not a security issue.
  3. **No memory safety issues in this specific commit**: While the referenced commit (925d844696d9) that introduced geneve support did later have security issues fixed (CVE-worthy bugs like integer overflow and type confusion as seen in commits b27055a08ad4 and 1b755d8eb1ac), this particular commit only fixes the netlink attribute structure.
  4. **The code change analysis**: The fix simply moves the `nla_nest_start_noflag()` call inside the while loop, so each geneve option gets its own nested attribute container. This is purely about correct data formatting for userspace consumption.
  This is similar to the non-CVE commits in the examples provided (like the one fixing a comment about NLA_U32 vs NLA_NESTED), where the issue is about API correctness rather than security.
9a119669fb192 netfilter: nf_tables: nft_fib: consistent l3mdev handling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this represents a security vulnerability. Let me analyze the key aspects:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes incorrect behavior in FIB (Forwarding Information Base) lookups when VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) devices are involved.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The bug causes FIB lookups to return 'unicast' instead of 'local' for addresses that are actually local to a VRF. This is incorrect behavior but doesn't introduce a security vulnerability:
     - It doesn't allow unauthorized access
     - It doesn't cause memory corruption or crashes
     - It doesn't bypass security checks
     - It doesn't lead to privilege escalation
  3. **Code changes**: The changes introduce a new helper function `nft_fib_l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu()` that properly determines the L3 master device index based on whether strict matching is requested. This ensures consistent behavior across IPv4 and IPv6.
  4. **Test failures**: The commit message shows test failures that are functional in nature - the FIB expression returns incorrect address types ('unicast' instead of 'local'). These are correctness issues, not security issues.
  5. **Similar commits**: Looking at the referenced similar commits, none have been assigned CVEs, and they all deal with routing table lookups and VRF handling, which are network configuration and routing correctness issues.
  The commit fixes a bug where netfilter's FIB expression would incorrectly classify local addresses in VRF environments, but this doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability - it's a functional bug that affects routing decisions in specific VRF configurations.
8259eb0e06d8f bpf, sockmap: Avoid using sk_socket after free when sending
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the vulnerability. Let me analyze all the evidence:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a race condition that leads to a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability where `sk->sk_socket` can be freed while the backlog thread is still using it through `skb_send_sock()`.
  2. **Security Impact**: The vulnerability can cause a kernel panic/crash as shown in the commit message:
     ```
     RIP: 0010:sock_sendmsg+0x21d/0x440
     ```
     This indicates the kernel tried to dereference a NULL or freed pointer when accessing `sock->ops->sendmsg`.
  3. **Race Condition Details**: The race occurs between:
     - **CPU0**: `sk_psock_backlog()` → `skb_send_sock()` → `sendmsg_unlocked()` → `sock_sendmsg()` → `sock->ops->sendmsg`
     - **CPU1**: `close(fd)` → `sock_map_close()` → sets `sk_socket->ops = NULL` and frees the socket
  4. **Exploitable Window**: The vulnerability exists because `sock_map_close()` can complete and free `sk_socket` while the backlog thread still holds a reference to it, leading to the UAF when `sock->ops->sendmsg` is called on the freed socket.
  5. **Wide Impact**: The commit message states "All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock) will be affected," indicating broad impact across different socket types.
  6. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the pattern of the similar commits that were assigned CVEs - it fixes a race condition in the sockmap subsystem that can lead to memory corruption and system crashes.
  The fix adds proper synchronization by incrementing the psock reference count in `sk_psock_backlog()` to ensure `sock_map_close()` waits for the backlog thread to complete before freeing resources, preventing the use-after-free condition.
3aa1dc3c9060e Bluetooth: btintel: Check dsbr size from EFI variable
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**: The original code has a classic stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `btintel_uefi_get_dsbr()` function. The vulnerable code:
     - Declares a fixed-size struct `btintel_dsbr` (5 bytes: 1 byte header + 4 bytes dsbr) on the stack
     - First queries the EFI variable size with `efi.get_variable()` 
     - Then reads the entire EFI variable into the fixed-size stack buffer using the size returned from the first call
     
  2. **Security Impact**: If an attacker can control the EFI variable `UefiCnvCommonDSBR` to be larger than 5 bytes, they can overflow the stack buffer when the second `efi.get_variable()` call writes more data than the struct can hold. This is a classic buffer overflow that could lead to:
     - Stack corruption
     - Potential code execution 
     - System crash/DoS
  3. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability is triggered during Bluetooth device initialization when `btintel_bootloader_setup_tlv()` is called. While EFI variables typically require elevated privileges to modify, this still represents a security boundary violation.
  4. **The Fix**: The commit properly fixes the vulnerability by:
     - Setting `data_size = sizeof(data)` initially instead of 0
     - Removing the two-step size query approach
     - Adding validation that the returned size matches the expected struct size
  This matches the pattern of similar CVE-assigned commits like "Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix u8 overflow" and "Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow" which also fixed buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
3bb88524b7d03 Bluetooth: MGMT: iterate over mesh commands in mgmt_mesh_foreach()
- [sasha] **CVE Status: YES**
  This commit fixes a type confusion vulnerability that could lead to memory corruption and potentially crash the system. Here's why:
  1. **Type Confusion**: The bug causes `mgmt_mesh_foreach()` to iterate over the wrong list (`&hdev->mgmt_pending` instead of `&hdev->mesh_pending`). These lists contain different structure types:
     - `mgmt_pending` contains `struct mgmt_pending_cmd` objects
     - `mesh_pending` contains `struct mgmt_mesh_tx` objects
  2. **Memory Layout Mismatch**: The structures have different layouts:
     - `mgmt_pending_cmd` has fields like `u16 opcode`, `void *param`, etc.
     - `mgmt_mesh_tx` has fields like `u8 handle`, `u8 instance`, etc.
  3. **Callback Function Expects Wrong Type**: The callback function passed to `mgmt_mesh_foreach()` (like `send_count()`) expects a `struct mgmt_mesh_tx *` pointer, but it's actually receiving a `struct mgmt_pending_cmd *` pointer cast as `mgmt_mesh_tx`.
  4. **Security Impact**: This type confusion can lead to:
     - Out-of-bounds memory access when the callback tries to access fields that don't exist at the expected offsets
     - Potential information disclosure if memory beyond the structure is read
     - Possible system crash/DoS if invalid memory is accessed
     - In worst case, could potentially be exploited for code execution if an attacker can control the contents of the mgmt_pending list
  5. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerable code is reachable through Bluetooth management interface operations (`MGMT_OP_MESH_READ_FEATURES`), which could be triggered by unprivileged local users with Bluetooth access.
  This is similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the examples that fix buffer overflows and memory safety issues in the Bluetooth subsystem.
4518e5a60c7fb vfio/type1: Fix error unwind in migration dirty bitmap allocation
- [sasha] Now I understand the bug. The issue is on line 296 where it uses `rb_entry(n, ...)` instead of `rb_entry(p, ...)`. This means during the unwind loop, it's always trying to free the bitmap of the same wrong node (n) instead of iterating through the previous nodes (p).
  **Analysis:**
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Memory Leak Security Impact**: The bug causes memory leaks when bitmap allocation fails during dirty page tracking setup for device migration. The unwind code uses the wrong loop variable (`n` instead of `p`), causing it to repeatedly try to free the same (wrong) bitmap instead of freeing the previously allocated bitmaps.
  2. **Resource Exhaustion Potential**: In the error path, multiple bitmap allocations remain in memory for the lifetime of the DMA mappings. Since bitmaps can be large (up to 256MB each based on `DIRTY_BITMAP_SIZE_MAX`), this could lead to significant memory exhaustion.
  3. **Attack Vector**: An attacker with access to VFIO (typically through VM device passthrough) could trigger allocation failures to cause memory leaks, potentially leading to DoS through memory exhaustion.
  4. **Similar to CVE-Assigned Commits**: This follows a similar pattern to the CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples - it's a memory leak in error handling paths within VFIO subsystem, which handles security-sensitive device passthrough operations.
  The code change clearly shows the fix: changing `rb_entry(n, ...)` to `rb_entry(p, ...)` on line 296, ensuring the unwind loop correctly frees previously allocated bitmaps.
8b53f46eb430f netfilter: nf_tables: nft_fib_ipv6: fix VRF ipv4/ipv6 result discrepancy
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and additional context, my answer is:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning based on the code changes:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a functional inconsistency between IPv4 and IPv6 FIB lookup behavior in VRF environments. The commit message clearly states it's fixing a "result discrepancy" where IPv4 returns the VRF interface name while IPv6 returns the real device name.
  2. **Code changes analysis**: The fix modifies the logic in `nft_fib6_eval()` to make IPv6 behave like IPv4:
     ```c
     - if (oif && oif != rt->rt6i_idev->dev &&
     -     l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu(rt->rt6i_idev->dev) != oif->ifindex)
     -     goto put_rt_err;
     + if (!oif) {
     +     found = rt->rt6i_idev->dev;
     + } else {
     +     if (oif == rt->rt6i_idev->dev ||
     +         l3mdev_master_ifindex_rcu(rt->rt6i_idev->dev) == oif->ifindex)
     +         found = oif;
     + }
     ```
     This change simply adjusts which interface name is returned - either the VRF master device or the real device.
  3. **No security impact**: The bug doesn't:
     - Allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Cause crashes or denial of service
     - Create exploitable conditions
     - Bypass security policies
  4. **Functional correctness issue**: This is purely about ensuring consistent behavior between IPv4 and IPv6 implementations when performing FIB lookups in VRF configurations. The commit even mentions it's to fix a test case failure.
  5. **Similar commits pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all deal with VRF/FIB functional correctness issues, particularly around l3mdev handling, and none were assigned CVEs.
  This is a typical functional bug fix that improves consistency and correctness of the netfilter subsystem but does not constitute a security vulnerability.
c38eb2973c18d netfilter: xtables: support arpt_mark and ipv6 optstrip for iptables-nft only builds
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  **NO**
  This commit is a build configuration fix, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit changes preprocessor conditionals from:
     - `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IP6_NF_MANGLE)` to `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES)`
     - `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IP_NF_ARPTABLES)` to `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IP_NF_ARPTABLES) || IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NFT_COMPAT_ARP)`
  2. **Purpose**: The commit message explicitly states this is to support "iptables-nft only builds" - it's enabling functionality for specific kernel configurations where classic iptables support is disabled but nftables compatibility is enabled.
  3. **No security impact**: 
     - The code changes only affect when certain modules are included in the build
     - No runtime behavior changes for existing configurations
     - No access control, privilege, or input validation changes
     - No fixes to memory corruption, buffer overflows, or other security-sensitive bugs
  4. **Build/configuration issue**: This fixes a configuration dependency issue introduced by commit a9525c7f6219 which allowed building kernels without classic iptables support. The issue was that some xtables modules (TCPOPTSTRIP and MARK) couldn't be built in certain valid configurations.
  The commit is purely a build system/configuration fix to ensure proper module availability in different kernel configurations. It doesn't address any security vulnerability.
4e2e6841ff761 bpf: Revert "bpf: remove unnecessary rcu_read_{lock,unlock}() in multi-uprobe attach logic"
- [sasha] Now I understand the complete vulnerability. Let me analyze it:
  1. `find_vpid()` returns a pointer to a `struct pid` from the IDR tree
  2. The PID structure is RCU-protected and freed via `call_rcu()`
  3. Without `rcu_read_lock()`, the PID can be freed between `find_vpid()` and `get_pid_task()`
  4. This creates a use-after-free vulnerability
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a clear use-after-free vulnerability. The original commit 4a8f635a6054 incorrectly removed RCU protection around `find_vpid()`, violating its documented requirement that it must be called with either tasklist_lock or rcu_read_lock() held. 
  The vulnerability allows a race condition where:
  1. `find_vpid(pid)` returns a pointer to a PID structure
  2. Another CPU frees that PID structure via `free_pid()` -> `call_rcu()` -> `delayed_put_pid()`
  3. `get_pid_task()` then accesses the freed PID structure, causing use-after-free
  This is a security vulnerability because it can lead to kernel memory corruption, potential privilege escalation, or system crashes when the BPF subsystem tries to attach uprobes to processes.
249173e94dd5e wifi: mt76: fix available_antennas setting
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the issue based on the code change:
  **Analysis:**
  The commit fixes an issue where `available_antennas_tx` and `available_antennas_rx` could be overwritten with incorrect values. Looking at the code:
  1. **Original code** (lines 452-453):
     ```c
     wiphy->available_antennas_tx = phy->antenna_mask;
     wiphy->available_antennas_rx = phy->antenna_mask;
     ```
  2. **Fixed code**:
     ```c
     if (!wiphy->available_antennas_tx)
         wiphy->available_antennas_tx = phy->antenna_mask;
     if (!wiphy->available_antennas_rx)
         wiphy->available_antennas_rx = phy->antenna_mask;
     ```
  3. **Root cause**: In the mt7996 driver with multi-radio wiphy support (introduced in commit 69d54ce7491d), the `mt7996_init_wiphy_band` function uses OR operations to combine antenna masks from multiple radios:
     ```c
     wiphy->available_antennas_rx |= phy->mt76->chainmask;
     wiphy->available_antennas_tx |= phy->mt76->chainmask;
     ```
  4. **The problem**: When `mt76_phy_init` is called later in the initialization process, it would unconditionally overwrite these carefully constructed antenna masks with just the single phy's antenna_mask, losing the combined antenna information from multiple radios.
  **Security Impact Assessment:**
  This bug results in:
  - **Incorrect antenna configuration** - The driver would report and use incorrect antenna capabilities
  - **Functional impact only** - This affects WiFi functionality and performance, not security
  - **No privilege escalation** - No elevation of privileges possible
  - **No information disclosure** - No sensitive data exposed
  - **No denial of service** - System remains operational, just with degraded WiFi performance
  - **No remote exploitation** - Cannot be triggered remotely
  This is purely a functional bug that causes incorrect antenna configuration in multi-radio WiFi setups. It would lead to degraded WiFi performance but poses no security risk.
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in antenna configuration for multi-radio WiFi setups. While it could impact WiFi performance and functionality, it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. The issue is limited to incorrect hardware capability reporting and configuration, with no potential for exploitation, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service attacks.
42cb27af34de4 wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix RX buffer size of MCU event
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
d5012734fc4bd wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix invalid NSS setting when TX path differs from NSS
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the information provided:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a configuration/validation fix that prevents setting an invalid NSS (Number of Spatial Streams) value when the TX path count differs from the NSS count. The code adds `orig_antenna_mask` to properly track and validate antenna configurations.
  2. **Security impact**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It addresses a functional issue where:
     - Invalid NSS settings could be configured when TX paths differ from NSS
     - This is a hardware capability mismatch issue, not a security vulnerability
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure is involved
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - Adds `orig_antenna_mask` field to track original antenna mask
     - Updates validation in `mt7996_set_antenna()` to properly check against both chainmask and antenna mask
     - The fix ensures hardware capabilities are properly respected
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all address:
     - Configuration issues
     - Hardware capability mismatches
     - Functional correctness problems
     - None involve security vulnerabilities
  5. **Type of issue**: This is a functional bug fix that prevents misconfiguration of wireless hardware parameters. While it could potentially cause the device to malfunction if misconfigured, it does not represent an exploitable security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
  The commit is purely about ensuring proper hardware configuration validation and does not introduce or fix any security-relevant issues.
8b2f574845e33 wifi: mt76: mt7996: set EHT max ampdu length capability
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what I've found:
  1. This commit adds setting of `IEEE80211_EHT_MAC_CAP1_MAX_AMPDU_LEN_MASK` bit in the EHT MAC capabilities
  2. The commit message states this is needed for "correct capability" and to achieve "peak throughput on the 2 GHz band"
  3. Without this bit set, peer stations cannot obtain the correct capability
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Performance issue, not security**: The commit fixes a capability advertisement issue that prevents achieving peak throughput. This is a performance/functionality bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only affects how the driver advertises its AMPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit) length capabilities to peer stations. Setting this bit allows the device to properly advertise its maximum AMPDU length support for EHT (802.11be) connections.
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO") also deal with capability advertisements for WiFi standards (MPDU length, EHT capabilities, etc.). These are all configuration/performance fixes rather than security issues.
  4. **No exploitation vector**: There's no input validation issue, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or any other security-relevant pattern. It's simply setting a capability bit that was missing, which caused suboptimal performance.
  The commit is a straightforward fix to properly advertise hardware capabilities for the EHT (Extremely High Throughput / WiFi 7) standard, specifically for AMPDU aggregation on the 2.4 GHz band.
5c78949fc7cd7 wifi: mt76: mt7996: fix beamformee SS field
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with similar historical commits, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Change**: The commit simply swaps the logic between `is_mt7996()` and `is_mt7992()` checks for setting beamformee STS (Space-Time Streams) capability values. This is a pure capability advertisement correction where:
     - MT7992 should advertise 5 STS capability (value 0x4)
     - MT7996/MT7990 should advertise 4 STS capability (value 0x3)
  2. **No Security Impact**: The beamformee SS field values being incorrect would:
     - Cause wrong capability advertisement to peer devices
     - Potentially impact performance or compatibility
     - But NOT create any exploitable security condition
  3. **Comparison with CVE-assigned Commit**: The similar commit marked "CVE Status: YES" fixed a NULL pointer dereference where:
     - Code could crash the kernel by dereferencing a NULL `vc` pointer
     - This is a clear security vulnerability (potential DoS)
     - The fix added a NULL check: `if (!vc) return;`
  4. **Code Analysis**: The change only affects capability bits in the HE PHY capabilities:
     ```c
     - if (is_mt7996(phy->mt76->dev))
     + if (is_mt7992(phy->mt76->dev))
     ```
     These values are used for capability negotiation, not for memory operations or control flow that could be exploited.
  5. **Pattern Recognition**: Other similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO" also dealt with capability/configuration fixes rather than memory safety or crash issues.
  This is a functional correctness fix for proper hardware capability advertisement, not a security vulnerability fix.
aa97ff5782cf0 wifi: mt76: mt7925: ensure all MCU commands wait for response
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The changes ensure MCU commands wait for acknowledgment, but this appears to be a reliability/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. Key observations:
  1. The code changes the `wait_resp` parameter from `false` to `true` in multiple MCU command functions
  2. When `wait_resp` is false, the driver sends commands without waiting for confirmation (mcu.c:101-104)
  3. This could cause reliability issues but doesn't represent a security vulnerability
  The affected functions handle non-security-critical operations like:
  - Firmware logging configuration
  - EEPROM settings
  - Hardware scanning
  - Channel domain configuration
  There's no evidence this fixes memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security vulnerabilities. It's a driver reliability improvement ensuring proper command-response synchronization.
bd02eebfc0b35 wifi: mt76: mt7925: refine the sniffer commnad
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
  Let me examine the code changes:
  ```c
  -	mt76_mcu_send_msg(&dev->mt76, MCU_UNI_CMD(SNIFFER), &req, sizeof(req), true);
  -
   	return mt76_mcu_send_msg(&dev->mt76, MCU_UNI_CMD(SNIFFER), &req, sizeof(req),
   				 true);
  ```
  The change removes a duplicate call to `mt76_mcu_send_msg()`. This function sends a command to the MCU (microcontroller unit) to configure sniffer mode settings.
  **Analysis:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a code cleanup that removes redundant operations. The function was being called twice with identical parameters - once as a standalone statement (which was discarding the return value) and once in the return statement.
  2. **Security implications**: 
     - No memory corruption issues
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service impact beyond potentially unnecessary MCU operations
     - The duplicate call would just send the same command twice, which is inefficient but not a security vulnerability
  3. **Functional impact**: The duplicate call might cause:
     - Slightly increased latency
     - Unnecessary MCU processing
     - Potential confusion in MCU state (though unlikely given it's the same command)
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits, none of them received CVE assignments, and they all dealt with:
     - Configuration/settings issues
     - Parameter corrections
     - Feature implementations
     - None involved security vulnerabilities
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a code quality improvement that removes redundant operations. While the duplicate MCU command could theoretically cause minor issues like increased latency or unnecessary processing, it does not constitute a security vulnerability. There's no exploitable condition, no privilege boundary crossing, no memory safety issue, and no way for an attacker to leverage this for malicious purposes. This is a simple code cleanup fix for redundant operations.
122f270aca2c8 wifi: mt76: mt7925: prevent multiple scan commands
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE.
  Let me examine the code changes:
  The commit adds a simple check:
  ```c
  +	if (test_bit(MT76_HW_SCANNING, &phy->state))
  +		return -EBUSY;
  ```
  This prevents multiple scan commands from being issued simultaneously by checking if the `MT76_HW_SCANNING` bit is already set.
  Looking at the context:
  1. The function `mt7925_mcu_hw_scan` is responsible for initiating hardware scans
  2. It sets the `MT76_HW_SCANNING` bit when starting a scan: `set_bit(MT76_HW_SCANNING, &phy->state);`
  3. The new check prevents a second scan from starting while one is already active
  To determine if this is security-relevant, I need to understand what could happen without this check. Let me search for more context if $CVEKERNELTREE is available:
  ```bash
  if [ -n "$CVEKERNELTREE" ]; then
      cd "$CVEKERNELTREE"
      # Look for where MT76_HW_SCANNING is cleared
      git grep -n "clear_bit(MT76_HW_SCANNING" drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/
      # Look for potential issues with concurrent scans
      git grep -B5 -A5 "MT76_HW_SCANNING" drivers/net/wireless/mediatek/mt76/mt7925/
  fi
  ```
  Even without additional context, I can analyze the security implications:
  **Potential issues without this check:**
  1. Race conditions - Multiple concurrent scan operations could lead to corrupted state
  2. Resource exhaustion - Multiple scans could consume excessive resources
  3. Firmware confusion - The hardware/firmware might not handle concurrent scan commands properly
  However, these appear to be **reliability/stability issues** rather than security vulnerabilities:
  - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
  - No privilege escalation
  - No information disclosure
  - No bypass of security controls
  - The impact is limited to DoS at most (device malfunction)
  Comparing to the similar commits provided:
  - None of the similar commits with "NO" CVE status show fixes for memory corruption, access control, or other security-critical issues
  - They mostly fix functionality issues, configuration problems, or stability concerns
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit fixes a concurrency issue that could cause device instability or malfunction when multiple scan commands are issued simultaneously. While this improves reliability, it does not address a security vulnerability. The issue is limited to preventing proper device operation rather than allowing any security compromise like code execution, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. This is a quality/stability fix rather than a security fix.
efb95439c1477 wifi: mt76: mt7915: Fix null-ptr-deref in mt7915_mmio_wed_init()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The code calls `devm_ioremap()` at lines 651-653 and 679-680 but does not check if it returns NULL. When `devm_ioremap()` fails (e.g., due to memory allocation failure or invalid addresses), it returns NULL.
  2. **Exploitable Crash Path**: The `wed->wlan.base` pointer is subsequently used in the `wifi_r32()` and `wifi_w32()` functions in the mediatek ethernet driver without any NULL checks. These functions directly dereference the pointer with `readl(dev->wlan.base + reg)` and `writel(val, dev->wlan.base + reg)`.
  3. **Remote Triggerable**: This is in the WiFi driver's initialization path for WED (Wireless Ethernet Dispatch) functionality. While not directly remote exploitable, the initialization could potentially be triggered through various network operations or system state changes.
  4. **Security Impact**: A NULL pointer dereference in kernel space leads to a kernel panic/crash, resulting in a denial of service. This affects system availability.
  5. **Similar Pattern to CVE'd Commits**: The pattern matches the similar commits shown which received CVEs - they all involve NULL pointer dereferences in the mt76 WiFi driver where a pointer is used without checking if allocation/initialization succeeded.
  The fix properly adds NULL checks after both `devm_ioremap()` calls, returning `-ENOMEM` on failure, which prevents the NULL pointer dereference from occurring.
8f30e2b059757 wifi: mt76: mt7996: Fix null-ptr-deref in mt7996_mmio_wed_init()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the similar commits provided as reference:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability where `devm_ioremap()` can return NULL on error, but the code does not check for this condition before using the pointer.
  2. **Security Impact**: When `wed->wlan.base` is NULL and later dereferenced (through `mtk_wed_device_attach()` or other operations on the WED device), it will cause a kernel crash/panic, leading to a denial of service.
  3. **Similar CVE Patterns**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - All 5 similar commits with "CVE Status: YES" fix NULL pointer dereference issues in the mt76 wireless driver
     - They all involve checking for NULL pointers that were previously unchecked
     - The pattern is identical: a pointer that could be NULL is used without validation
  4. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds a critical NULL check:
     ```c
     wed->wlan.base = devm_ioremap(...);
     + if (!wed->wlan.base)
     +     return -ENOMEM;
     ```
     Without this check, any subsequent use of `wed->wlan.base` would cause a kernel crash when `devm_ioremap()` fails (e.g., due to resource exhaustion or invalid parameters).
  5. **Attack Surface**: This vulnerability can be triggered during device initialization, potentially by an attacker who can influence system resources or device configuration to make `devm_ioremap()` fail.
  The vulnerability is a classic NULL pointer dereference in kernel space that can lead to system crashes, making it a security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
7e1fcf687c2fb wifi: mt76: scan: Fix 'mlink' dereferenced before IS_ERR_OR_NULL check
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. Here's the issue:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a code quality issue (dereferencing before NULL check) but is not a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Non-exploitable condition**: The function `mt76_put_vif_phy_link()` is only called in controlled contexts where `mlink` is known to be valid:
     - In `mt76_scan_complete()`: Called with `dev->scan.mlink` 
     - In `mt76_roc_complete()`: Called with `phy->roc_link`
     - Both callers obtain `mlink` from `mt76_get_vif_phy_link()` which either returns a valid pointer or an error pointer (never NULL in successful cases)
  2. **Defensive programming fix**: The IS_ERR_OR_NULL check at the beginning of `mt76_put_vif_phy_link()` is defensive programming to handle unexpected cases. Moving the dereference after the check is good practice but doesn't fix an actual exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **Static analysis finding**: This was reported by automated tools (kernel test robot, Dan Carpenter's analysis) as a potential issue, not from an actual crash or security incident.
  4. **No security impact**: Even if NULL were passed, it would only cause a kernel oops/crash in the wireless driver, not a privilege escalation or information leak that would warrant CVE assignment.
  The similar commits with CVE assignments involved actual NULL pointer dereferences that could occur during normal operation when allocation failures happened (devm_kzalloc returning NULL) or when functions returned NULL in error cases that were then used without checking. This commit is different - it's fixing a theoretical issue caught by static analysis rather than a real vulnerability.
23205562ffc8d Bluetooth: separate CIS_LINK and BIS_LINK link types
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit directly based on the provided information.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code refactoring/cleanup commit that separates CIS_LINK and BIS_LINK link types that were previously both using ISO_LINK. The commit message explicitly states it's to avoid mixing up these connection types.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes show:
     - Replacing ISO_LINK with CIS_LINK or BIS_LINK throughout the codebase
     - Adding proper type checking to distinguish between unicast (CIS) and broadcast (BIS) connections
     - No memory corruption, buffer overflow, access control bypass, or other security vulnerability patterns
  3. **Type safety improvement**: The main issue being addressed is potential confusion between two different connection types that have "union fields that are different". This is a type safety and code correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **No exploitable impact**: The commit doesn't fix any condition that could be exploited by an attacker to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Cause denial of service
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Escalate privileges
  5. **Preventive measure**: While the commit mentions avoiding "complicating it" and ensuring proper distinction between connection types, this is a preventive measure to avoid potential bugs, not a fix for an existing security vulnerability.
  The changes are architectural improvements to the Bluetooth subsystem's handling of ISO connections, separating concerns between Connected Isochronous Streams (CIS) and Broadcast Isochronous Streams (BIS) for better code maintainability and correctness.
e2d471b7806b0 Bluetooth: ISO: Fix not using SID from adv report
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a functional issue where userspace applications cannot properly synchronize with Bluetooth broadcast sources because they don't have access to the SID (Set ID) information from the advertising reports. The fix allows applications to use HCI_SID_INVALID (0xff) and lets the kernel automatically update the SID when it receives advertising reports.
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The issue is about missing functionality/information exposure to userspace, not a security vulnerability. The kernel was simply not providing SID information that userspace needed.
  2. **No memory corruption or unsafe operations**: The changes add proper SID handling and synchronization logic without introducing memory safety issues.
  3. **No privilege escalation or unauthorized access**: The fix enables legitimate functionality for Bluetooth ISO broadcast synchronization.
  4. **Functional fix only**: The commit message clearly describes this as fixing the inability to synchronize with broadcast sources using different SIDs - this is a feature/functionality fix, not a security fix.
  5. **Safe value handling**: The code properly validates the SID value (checking for > 0x0f and != HCI_SID_INVALID) and handles the HCI_SID_INVALID case by waiting for reports to update it.
  The commit is similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - it fixes Bluetooth protocol handling and synchronization issues without introducing or fixing security vulnerabilities.
a0bdd3d1b94d2 wifi: mt76: mt7996: avoid null deref in mt7996_stop_phy()
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue clearly. In the original code, the function dereferences `phy->dev` before checking if `phy` is NULL:
  ```c
  struct mt7996_dev *dev = phy->dev;  // NULL deref if phy is NULL
  if (!phy || !test_bit(MT76_STATE_RUNNING, &phy->mt76->state))
      return;
  ```
  The fix moves the dereference after the NULL check:
  ```c
  struct mt7996_dev *dev;
  if (!phy || !test_bit(MT76_STATE_RUNNING, &phy->mt76->state))
      return;
  dev = phy->dev;  // Safe now, phy is known to be non-NULL
  ```
  Looking at the caller in mt7996_remove_interface(), the function already checks if `phy` is NULL before calling mt7996_stop_phy():
  ```c
  if (!phy)
      continue;
  // ...
  mt7996_stop_phy(phy);
  ```
  So in the current calling context, the NULL pointer dereference wouldn't actually occur. However, the function mt7996_stop_phy() has a defensive NULL check that was rendered useless by the early dereference.
  **Decision: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No actual vulnerability path**: The caller (mt7996_remove_interface) already checks for NULL before calling mt7996_stop_phy(), so the NULL dereference cannot occur in practice with the current code.
  2. **Defensive programming fix**: This is a fix for defensive programming - the function has a NULL check that was incorrectly placed after a dereference. While this is a bug, it doesn't create an exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **No user-controlled path**: There's no evidence that an attacker could control the `phy` pointer to be NULL through any user-accessible interface.
  4. **Code quality issue**: This is more of a code quality/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The NULL check was meant to be defensive but was incorrectly implemented.
  Unlike the similar commits shown which fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences that could occur through normal operation or user input, this fix addresses a theoretical issue where the defensive NULL check was improperly implemented but couldn't actually be triggered.
cb423ddad0f6e wifi: mt76: mt7996: avoid NULL pointer dereference in mt7996_set_monitor()
- [sasha] Now I can see the issue more clearly. In the first call site, there's a check `if (!phy || ...)` before calling mt7996_run(), and if that check passes (phy is not NULL), then mt7996_set_monitor() is called. 
  In the second call site, there's also a check `if (!phy)` that would skip the mt7996_set_monitor() call if phy is NULL.
  So based on the current code, it appears that mt7996_set_monitor() is never called with a NULL phy pointer. However, the function itself was dereferencing `phy->dev` before checking if phy is NULL, which is a defensive programming issue.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. While the current calling contexts check for NULL before calling mt7996_set_monitor(), the function itself had a logic error where it dereferenced `phy->dev` on line 417 before checking if `phy` is NULL on line 419. This creates a potential vulnerability if:
  1. Future code changes introduce a path that calls mt7996_set_monitor() without checking for NULL
  2. There's a race condition or unexpected state where phy becomes NULL between the caller's check and the function execution
  3. The function could be called from other contexts (modules, future patches) that don't perform the NULL check
  The pattern is similar to the CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples, which also fixed NULL pointer dereferences in the mt76 wireless driver by adding or reordering NULL checks before pointer usage.
d9bc625861d49 wifi: mt76: mt7996: prevent uninit return in mt7996_mac_sta_add_links
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes an uninitialized variable bug where the function `mt7996_mac_sta_add_links()` could return an uninitialized value of `ret` when jumping to the `error_unlink` label. The fix changes `ret` to `err` and properly initializes it before the error path.
  Key reasons this is not a CVE:
  1. **Programming error, not security vulnerability**: This is a straightforward uninitialized variable bug that results in undefined behavior but doesn't represent an exploitable security vulnerability.
  2. **Limited security impact**: The uninitialized return value would cause unpredictable behavior in error handling, but there's no indication this could be exploited for:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure (no sensitive data leaked)
     - Denial of service (beyond normal error handling)
     - Memory corruption
  3. **Error path only**: The bug only occurs in error cases when `link_conf_dereference_protected()`, `mt7996_vif_link()`, or `link_sta_dereference_protected()` fail, limiting the attack surface.
  4. **Wireless driver context**: While this is in wireless code, the bug is in station link management during MLO (Multi-Link Operation) setup, not in any security-critical path like authentication or encryption.
  This is a quality/reliability fix rather than a security fix, similar to the reference commits shown which also dealt with MLO-related initialization and setup issues without being assigned CVEs.
caf4b347c5dc4 wifi: mt76: mt7996: Add NULL check in mt7996_thermal_init
- [sasha] Perfect! The hwmon registration function explicitly checks for NULL name and returns -EINVAL. So there would not be a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel, but rather a failed hwmon registration.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  While the commit does fix a missing NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()`, the issue would not lead to a security vulnerability:
  1. The `thermal_cooling_device_register()` function properly handles NULL by converting it to an empty string (line 1083 in thermal_core.c: `type ? type : ""`).
  2. The `hwmon_device_register_with_groups()` function explicitly checks for NULL name and returns `-EINVAL` error rather than dereferencing the NULL pointer.
  3. The worst-case scenario is that thermal initialization would fail with an error, which is a functionality bug rather than a security vulnerability. There's no potential for memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security impacts.
  4. The similar commits shown (commits 1-3) that add NULL checks for `devm_kasprintf()` in mt7915/mt7921/mt7615 drivers were marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of fix is not considered security-critical.
  5. This is a defensive programming improvement that prevents a potential initialization failure, but not a security vulnerability fix.
88224119863c3 wifi: mt76: mt7925: Fix logical vs bitwise typo
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the bug it fixes:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This is a logical vs bitwise operator bug that affects regulatory compliance, not security. The bug causes incorrect parsing of regulatory domain rules that determine whether Wi-Fi 7 (EHT) features should be enabled.
  2. **No Exploitable Attack Vector**: The bug cannot be exploited by an attacker to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Execute arbitrary code
     - Cause denial of service
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Escalate privileges
  3. **Regulatory Compliance Issue**: The impact is that Wi-Fi 7 features might be enabled in countries where they're not authorized, which is a regulatory/legal compliance issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to Commit 3**: The referenced similar commit #3 (fixing mixed declarations) was also marked "CVE Status: NO" because it was a code quality issue without security implications.
  5. **Different from Commits 1 & 2**: The commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved off-by-one errors that could lead to out-of-bounds reads/writes, which are classic memory safety vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
  The bug simply causes the function to exit the regulatory rule checking loop prematurely when checking if Wi-Fi 7 should be enabled for a specific country, potentially enabling features that violate local radio regulations but posing no security risk.
071d8e4c2a3b0 kernfs: Relax constraint in draining guard
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It removes an overly-sensitive WARN_ON_ONCE check that was causing false positives. The removed check at line 782 of fs/kernfs/file.c was incorrectly triggering for legitimate kernel operations when kernfs_break_active_protection/kernfs_unbreak_active_protection were used. 
  This is a diagnostic fix, not a security vulnerability fix. While the false warning could cause kernel panics on systems with panic_on_warn=1, this is considered a quality issue rather than a security vulnerability since:
  1. The WARN was incorrect (false positive) 
  2. No actual security protection is removed
  3. panic_on_warn is an optional debugging feature
  4. The underlying kernfs operations remain safe
  Similar to commit #3 in the reference examples (which also fixed false-positive WARN issues), this does not warrant a CVE.
990b5c07f677a RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix return code of bnxt_re_configure_cc
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Minor error code change**: The commit only changes the return code from `-EINVAL` (Invalid argument) to `-EOPNOTSUPP` (Operation not supported) when unsupported congestion control parameters are provided. This is a cosmetic fix for better error reporting.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The change does not fix any security vulnerability. It doesn't address:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Any exploitable condition
  3. **Debugfs interface**: The affected code is in the debugfs interface, which is typically only accessible to privileged users (root) and is used for debugging purposes, not production functionality.
  4. **Logic remains the same**: The function still properly rejects unsupported parameters - it just returns a more appropriate error code. The security posture of the code is unchanged.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they fix actual functional issues (error handling, workarounds for hardware bugs, parameter validation) but were still marked as "NO CVE". This trivial error code change is even less significant.
  The commit is a minor cleanup that improves error reporting accuracy but has no security implications whatsoever.
e3d57a00d4d1f RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix missing error handling for tx_queue
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what the commit is fixing. Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a missing error return for an unsupported debugfs configuration parameter (`tx_queue`). This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Limited exposure**: The affected code is in debugfs, which requires root privileges to access (`debugfs_create_file` with mode 0400). Only root can interact with these files.
  3. **No security impact**: The bug causes silent failures when trying to modify the `tx_queue` congestion control parameter through debugfs. The original code simply ignored the value (empty `break` statement), while the fix properly returns `-EOPNOTSUPP` to indicate the operation is not supported.
  4. **Behavior change**: The fix changes from silently ignoring the parameter to explicitly returning an error. This improves the user interface but doesn't fix any security issue.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that return more meaningful errors (like Similar Commit 1 changing -EFAULT to -EIO) were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Only commits fixing actual memory issues (like Similar Commits 4 and 5 fixing memory allocation checks) received CVEs.
  The commit is a quality improvement that provides better error feedback to administrators but does not address any security vulnerability.
58d7a965bb2b0 RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix incorrect display of inactivity_cp in debugfs output
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Debugfs interface only**: The issue is in the debugfs interface (`/sys/kernel/debug/`), which requires root privileges to access. Debugfs is specifically designed for debugging and is not a security boundary.
  2. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The issue is that the `inactivity_cp` parameter was not being properly mapped in the debugfs read/write functions. The commit adds the missing case statements:
     - In `map_cc_config_offset_gen0_ext0()`: adds handling for `CMDQ_MODIFY_ROCE_CC_MODIFY_MASK_INACTIVITY_CP`
     - In `bnxt_re_fill_gen0_ext0()`: adds proper value assignment for the same mask
  3. **No security impact**: The bug only resulted in "Invalid argument" errors when trying to read/write the inactivity_cp parameter through debugfs. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service potential
     
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they also fix various functional issues in the RDMA driver without security implications - reference counting, configuration issues, and error handling improvements.
  This is a straightforward functional fix that ensures the congestion control parameter `inactivity_cp` can be properly read and written through the debugfs interface, with no security implications.
9ad5249b37b59 scsi: mpt3sas: Fix _ctl_get_mpt_mctp_passthru_adapter() to return IOC pointer
- [sasha] Looking at the commit changes provided, the fix is clear:
  **Before (buggy code):**
  ```c
  if (count == dev_index) {
      spin_unlock(&gioc_lock);
      return 0;  // BUG: Returns NULL instead of ioc pointer
  }
  ```
  **After (fixed code):**
  ```c
  if (count == dev_index) {
      spin_unlock(&gioc_lock);
      return ioc;  // CORRECT: Returns the ioc pointer
  }
  count++;  // Also adds missing counter increment
  ```
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Programming Error, Not Security Vulnerability**: This is a simple programming bug where the function returns 0 (NULL) instead of the `ioc` pointer. When the caller (`mpt3sas_send_mctp_passthru_req`) receives NULL, it properly checks for it and returns `-ENODEV`, which is safe error handling.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The bug causes the MCTP passthrough functionality to always fail with `-ENODEV` (device not found), even when a valid device exists. This is a functionality bug that prevents the feature from working, but it doesn't create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond the feature not working
  3. **Controlled Failure**: The NULL return is properly handled by the caller with an `if (!ioc) return -ENODEV;` check, preventing any NULL pointer dereference or crashes.
  4. **Limited Scope**: This only affects the new MCTP passthrough feature that was just added. It's a feature that doesn't work due to the bug, rather than a feature that works unsafely.
  This is similar to the reference commits provided which also fixed functional bugs (mutex handling, revert of incorrect backport, function export, test additions) without security implications.
53755903b9357 scsi: ufs: mcq: Delete ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd() in ufshcd_mcq_abort()
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **Analysis:**
  1. **The Bug**: When `ufshcd_mcq_abort()` is called to abort a command:
     - It calls `ufshcd_try_to_abort_task()` to send UFS_ABORT_TASK to the device
     - If successful, it calls `ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd()` which decrements `hba->clk_gating.active_reqs`
     - However, the device will later generate an MCQ IRQ with OCS_ABORTED response
     - This triggers `ufshcd_compl_one_cqe()` which also calls `ufshcd_release_scsi_cmd()`
     - This results in `hba->clk_gating.active_reqs` being decremented twice for the same command
  2. **The Impact**:
     - The `active_reqs` counter becomes negative (underflows)
     - This is a reference counting bug that affects clock gating logic
     - The clock gating mechanism uses this counter to determine when it's safe to gate clocks
     - With a negative/incorrect counter, clock gating decisions will be wrong
  3. **Security Implications**:
     - This is primarily a **functional bug** affecting power management
     - The incorrect reference count could lead to:
       - Clocks being gated when they shouldn't be (causing hangs/crashes)
       - Clocks staying ungated when they should be gated (power efficiency issue)
     - There is no direct security vulnerability here:
       - No memory corruption
       - No privilege escalation
       - No information disclosure
       - No denial of service beyond potential system instability
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a race condition leading to NULL pointer dereference
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a kernel panic when removing driver
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference in abort path
     - This commit fixes a reference counting bug, not a crash or security issue
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a real bug that could cause system instability due to incorrect clock gating decisions, it does not represent a security vulnerability. The issue is a functional bug in the reference counting mechanism for clock gating, which could lead to power management issues or potential hangs, but does not provide any attack vector for malicious exploitation. Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed NULL pointer dereferences and kernel panics), this is purely a correctness fix for a reference counting bug.
86dee87f4b2e6 pinctrl: mediatek: Fix the invalid conditions
- [sasha] **NO**
  While this commit fixes a type comparison issue between signed and unsigned integers, it does not represent a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Limited attack surface**: The bug occurs in `mtk_build_eint()` during device initialization when parsing device tree properties. This is not attacker-controlled input - device tree properties are set at boot time and require privileged access to modify.
  2. **Early validation failure**: Even in the buggy code, if `of_property_count_strings()` returns a negative error, the subsequent allocation `devm_kmalloc_array(&pdev->dev, hw->eint->nbase, ...)` would likely fail or be caught by kernel memory allocation bounds checking, preventing exploitation.
  3. **No demonstrated security impact**: The commit message and code changes focus on fixing incorrect type comparisons for code correctness, not addressing a security vulnerability. There's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security impacts.
  4. **Similar commits without CVEs**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit #1 and #2 fix off-by-one bugs and unused variables in the same subsystem but were marked "CVE Status: NO". These had more direct potential for out-of-bounds access but still didn't warrant CVEs.
  5. **Type safety fix**: This is primarily a code quality improvement to ensure proper type handling and validation, similar to compiler warning fixes rather than security vulnerability patches.
  The fix improves code robustness by properly checking for negative return values and ensuring type compatibility, but it doesn't address an exploitable security vulnerability.
ac4e317a95a10 wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The vulnerability is a remotely exploitable security issue where a malicious USB device can trigger a divide-by-zero error in the kernel, leading to a system crash or potential out-of-bounds read.
  Specifically, examining the code at line 277 in `ath9k_htc_choose_bslot()`:
  ```c
  slot = ((tsftu % intval) * ATH9K_HTC_MAX_BCN_VIF) / intval;
  ```
  Where `intval` comes from `priv->cur_beacon_conf.beacon_interval`. If a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event is sent before beacon configuration is complete (when `enable_beacon` is false), `beacon_interval` can be 0, causing a divide-by-zero kernel panic.
  The fix adds a critical security check:
  ```c
  if (!priv->cur_beacon_conf.enable_beacon)
      return;
  ```
  This prevents processing Software Beacon Alert events when beaconing hasn't been properly initialized, avoiding the crash. The vulnerability allows a malicious USB device to cause a denial of service by crashing the kernel, which is a clear security issue warranting CVE assignment.
2777a40998deb hisi_acc_vfio_pci: bugfix live migration function without VF device driver
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I'll provide my CVE assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Non-exploitable null pointer dereference**: The commit fixes a null pointer dereference that occurs when the VF device driver is not loaded in the Guest OS during live migration. However, this is a non-exploitable crash condition that requires specific circumstances:
     - The issue only occurs during VM live migration
     - It requires the VF device driver to not be loaded in the guest
     - The null dereference happens when trying to restore migration data
  2. **Defensive programming fix**: The changes add null checks for DMA addresses before using them:
     ```c
     if (!vf_data->eqe_dma || !vf_data->aeqe_dma ||
         !vf_data->sqc_dma || !vf_data->cqc_dma) {
         dev_info(dev, "resume dma addr is NULL!\n");
         hisi_acc_vdev->vf_qm_state = QM_NOT_READY;
         return 0;
     }
     ```
  3. **Limited attack surface**: 
     - This is in the VFIO subsystem which requires privileged access
     - The issue only affects HiSilicon ACC devices during live migration
     - An attacker would need to control the migration process to trigger this
  4. **Operational issue, not security vulnerability**: The bug causes a migration failure/crash but doesn't lead to:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Memory corruption beyond the crash
     - Bypass of security boundaries
  5. **Similar commits comparison**: Looking at the CVE-assigned similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed actual data corruption during migration
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) fixed a null pointer dereference in interrupt handling that could be triggered remotely
     - This commit fixes a more benign operational issue
  The fix improves robustness but doesn't address a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
db6525a857395 hisi_acc_vfio_pci: bugfix the problem of uninstalling driver
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a resource leak/reference counting bug that prevents proper driver unloading. The issue is that migration file descriptors are not properly released when the device is closed in certain failure scenarios (when destination VF count > source VF count during live migration).
  2. **Impact is limited to functionality**: The bug causes:
     - Driver module reference count to remain elevated
     - Inability to unload the driver module
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure
  3. **The fix is straightforward**: The patch simply adds a call to `hisi_acc_vf_disable_fds()` in the close_device path to ensure migration file descriptors are always released, matching the existing cleanup pattern used elsewhere in the code.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical commits provided, this is similar to commit 4 (CVE Status: NO) which fixed an error handling path without security implications. The CVE-assigned commits (1, 2, 3) involved data corruption during migration or memory leaks that could be exploited.
  The issue is a functional bug that affects driver lifecycle management rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
e63c466398731 hisi_acc_vfio_pci: bugfix cache write-back issue
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **The bug causes data corruption during live migration**: The commit message clearly states that "Writing back to the cache at this stage will cause the data obtained by the cache to be written back to be empty." This means that during VFIO live migration of HiSilicon ACC VF devices, the cache write-back was happening at the wrong time, resulting in empty/corrupted migration data.
  2. **Security impact**: This bug directly affects the integrity of virtual machine live migration data. When migrating a VM with HiSilicon ACC VF devices, the migration could complete "successfully" but with corrupted device state, potentially leading to:
     - Guest VM crashes or instability after migration
     - Potential data loss or corruption in the guest
     - Incorrect device behavior that could be exploited
  3. **The fix moves a critical operation**: The code change moves `vf_qm_cache_wb()` from `vf_qm_state_save()` (called during the copy stage) to `hisi_acc_vf_stop_device()` (called during the stop stage). This ensures the cache is properly flushed before reading the device state.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the reference commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed migration data corruption due to incorrect pointer updates
     - Similar Commit 2 & 3 (CVE: YES) fixed memory leaks that could impact system stability
     - This commit fixes migration data corruption, which is equally or more severe
  5. **Clear exploitable scenario**: An attacker with the ability to trigger VM migrations could potentially exploit this to cause denial of service or data corruption in target systems using these specific HiSilicon accelerator devices.
  The bug is in the VFIO subsystem's live migration support for HiSilicon ACC devices, which is a security-sensitive component that handles VM device state during migration.
3495cec078772 hisi_acc_vfio_pci: add eq and aeq interruption restore
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is adding functionality to properly restore interrupt state during live migration. It's ensuring that task completion interrupts are not lost during the migration process, which is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Purpose is feature completeness**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "ensure that the task packets of the accelerator device are not lost during the migration process". This is about preventing data loss/ensuring data integrity during migration, not fixing a security flaw.
  3. **Code changes are additive**: The changes add a new function `vf_qm_xeqc_save()` that saves and restores the EQ (Event Queue) and AEQ (Asynchronous Event Queue) head positions by writing them to the device via doorbell commands. This ensures the device can recheck for uncompleted tasks after migration.
  4. **Similar to commit 3 (CVE Status: NO)**: This commit has similar characteristics to the example commit 3 which fixes I/O errors and ensures proper device state handling but was not assigned a CVE.
  5. **No security impact**: There's no indication that the missing interrupt restoration could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, or any other security impact. It's purely a functional issue where task completion notifications might be lost during migration.
  The commit is fixing a functional deficiency in the live migration implementation where interrupt state wasn't being properly restored, leading to potential loss of task completion notifications. This is a bug fix for correctness, not a security vulnerability.
8bb7170c5a055 hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states that "guest kernel-mode encryption services failure" occurs due to incorrect DMA addresses after migration. This indicates a security-relevant failure where encryption services are compromised.
  2. **Memory Corruption Risk**: The bug involves incorrect DMA address calculation during VFIO live migration. The code shows the fix changes from:
     ```c
     // Before (incorrect):
     vf_data->eqe_dma = vf_data->qm_eqc_dw[1];
     vf_data->eqe_dma |= vf_data->qm_eqc_dw[0];
     
     // After (correct):
     vf_data->eqe_dma = vf_data->qm_eqc_dw[QM_XQC_ADDR_HIGH];
     vf_data->eqe_dma |= vf_data->qm_eqc_dw[QM_XQC_ADDR_LOW];
     ```
     The indices were swapped (using [1] and [0] instead of [2] and [1]), causing wrong DMA addresses.
  3. **Guest VM Compromise**: Wrong DMA addresses in a virtualization context can lead to:
     - Guest VMs accessing incorrect memory regions
     - Potential information disclosure between VMs
     - Corruption of guest kernel encryption services
     - Possible privilege escalation scenarios
  4. **Migration Security**: The bug affects VFIO live migration, which is a security-sensitive operation. The introduction of version checking (`ACC_DEV_MAGIC_V1` vs `ACC_DEV_MAGIC_V2`) and backward compatibility handling shows this is fixing a fundamental protocol issue that could compromise VM isolation.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the reference commits, this shares characteristics with "Similar Commit 1" which was assigned a CVE - both involve data corruption during device migration that can affect system security.
  The incorrect DMA address handling during VM migration represents a clear security vulnerability that could compromise guest VM isolation and encryption services.
89142d34d5602 wifi: ath12k: fix memory leak in ath12k_service_ready_ext_event
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
aabd3be90579e wifi: ath12k: Reorder and relocate the release of resources in ath12k_core_deinit()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, I'll determine if this should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes an ordering/cleanup issue in the driver's initialization and deinitialization paths, but it does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The problem is a resource cleanup ordering issue where the panic notifier is not properly unregistered in certain error paths (when ATH12K_FLAG_QMI_FAIL is set). This leads to a stale entry in the panic notifier list.
  2. **Impact**: The issue only manifests as a page fault when:
     - The driver fails to load (e.g., BDF load failure)
     - The driver is unloaded 
     - The driver is loaded again
     This is a specific sequence that requires driver reload after a failure.
  3. **Attack vector**: This is not an exploitable vulnerability. It requires:
     - Local access to load/unload kernel modules
     - A specific failure condition during driver initialization
     - The issue only causes a crash, not privilege escalation or information disclosure
  4. **Similar commits comparison**: The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" all fix NULL pointer dereferences or use-after-free conditions that can occur during normal operation or common error paths. This commit fixes a very specific edge case during driver reload after initialization failure.
  The fix simply reorders the cleanup operations to ensure proper symmetry between init and deinit paths, preventing the stale notifier list entry. This is a quality/reliability fix rather than a security fix.

9548feff840a0 iommu: remove duplicate selection of DMAR_TABLE
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a minor build configuration cleanup that removes a duplicate Kconfig selection. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: The commit only removes a duplicate `select DMAR_TABLE if INTEL_IOMMU` line from drivers/iommu/Kconfig. This same selection already exists in drivers/iommu/intel/Kconfig (line 20: `select DMAR_TABLE`).
  2. **Build configuration only**: This is purely a Kconfig cleanup that has no impact on runtime behavior, memory safety, access control, or any security boundaries.
  3. **No functional change**: Since DMAR_TABLE is already selected when CONFIG_INTEL_IOMMU is enabled (via intel/Kconfig), removing the duplicate selection has zero functional impact.
  4. **Fixes a previous build fix**: The commit it fixes (70bad345e622) was itself a build configuration fix to prevent compilation failures, not a security fix.
  5. **Pattern matching with similar commits**: All the similar commits provided show build fixes, module loading fixes, and DMA mapping handling - none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  This is a typical kernel maintenance commit that improves code organization by removing redundant configuration without any security implications.
3cc35394fac15 wifi: rtw89: fix firmware scan delay unit for WiFi 6 chips
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a unit conversion bug in the WiFi driver's scan delay functionality. The bug causes the firmware to use an incorrect delay period (approximately 1/10th of the intended delay) for Wake-on-WLAN (WoWLAN) network detection scanning.
  Key reasons this is not security-relevant:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The bug only affects timing parameters for scan operations during WoWLAN. It doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or bypass of security controls.
  2. **Functional issue only**: The incorrect unit (104800 microseconds instead of 1000000 microseconds) causes the firmware to scan too frequently, which is a power consumption and functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No exploitable attack vector**: An attacker cannot leverage this timing bug to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or extract sensitive information. The bug simply makes the scan happen about 10 times faster than intended.
  4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects WoWLAN net-detect functionality when the device is in suspend mode, and only impacts the timing between scans.
  Similar to commit 3 in the reference list ("wifi: rtw89: correct aSIFSTime for 6GHz band"), this is a timing parameter correction that ensures proper protocol operation but has no security implications.
4c2c372de2e10 wifi: rtw88: fix the 'para' buffer size to avoid reading out of bounds
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**: The code declares a 2-byte buffer `para[2]` but passes `&para[1]` to `rtw_fw_bt_wifi_control()`, which reads 5 bytes (data[0] through data[4]). This results in reading 4 bytes beyond the buffer bounds.
  2. **Security Impact**: This out-of-bounds read could potentially:
     - Leak kernel stack information
     - Expose sensitive data from adjacent memory
     - Lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities
  3. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits I reviewed (CVE Status: YES) all involve out-of-bounds memory access:
     - Commit 1: "avoid reading out of bounds when loading TX power FW elements" 
     - Commit 3: "Fix for out-of bound access error"
     - Commits 4 & 5: "fix off by one" array bounds checking
  4. **Real vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states it's fixing reading out of bounds, and the code change shows a clear buffer size mismatch between what's allocated (2 bytes) and what's being read (5 bytes from &para[1]).
  5. **Impact scope**: This affects the Realtek rtw88 wireless driver, which is used in various WiFi devices, making it a security concern for systems using these drivers.
  The fix properly increases the buffer size to 6 bytes to accommodate all the data being read, preventing the out-of-bounds access.
dda27a47c036d wifi: rtw89: pci: enlarge retry times of RX tag to 1000
- [sasha] Now let me understand better what the RX tag validation mechanism does by looking at the similar commits provided:
  Based on the similar commits, I can see that the RX tag is a mechanism used to ensure that DMA operations are complete before the driver processes RX buffers. The tag is a sequence number (13-bit value, range 1-0x1FFF) that helps prevent race conditions between the DMA engine and the driver.
  **Analysis:**
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a reliability/compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability. The change simply increases the retry count from 100 to 1000 to accommodate slower hardware platforms (specifically the Gigabyte X870 AORUS ELITE WIFI7).
  2. **No security impact**: The failure mode results in:
     - Warning messages being logged
     - Connection drops due to RX/TX processing failures
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data leakage
  3. **Hardware timing issue**: The root cause is a hardware timing characteristic where some platforms need more time for DMA operations to complete. This is a compatibility/reliability issue, not a security flaw.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all deal with race condition fixes and hardware compatibility improvements in the same driver, none of which were assigned CVEs.
  5. **Fail-safe behavior**: When the retry limit is exceeded, the driver properly handles the error by logging warnings and skipping the problematic buffers, preventing any undefined behavior.
  The change is a simple timing adjustment to improve hardware compatibility and prevent connection drops on certain platforms, which is a quality/reliability improvement rather than a security fix.
a70cf04b08f44 wifi: rtw89: pci: configure manual DAC mode via PCI config API only
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that causes a kernel oops when accessing unmapped PCI memory. This is triggered by accessing `0x0000000000001090` when the mmap isn't set yet.
  2. **Trigger conditions**: The bug occurs during device initialization in the PCI probe path when configuring DAC (Direct Access Controller) mode for 36-bit DMA support. It's triggered by normal device initialization, not by malicious input.
  3. **Impact**: The crash occurs in `rtw89_pci_ops_write16` when trying to write to an unmapped address. This causes a page fault and kernel oops, but:
     - It happens during device probe/initialization
     - It's not exploitable by an attacker
     - It doesn't lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts
     - It's a functional bug that prevents the driver from loading properly
  4. **Fix nature**: The fix changes from using DBI (Device Bar Interface) access via mmap to using PCI config API only (`pci_read_config_byte`/`pci_write_config_byte`), which is safer during early initialization when mmap isn't available yet.
  5. **Similar commits**: All the similar commits provided (RTW89 PCI-related fixes) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", and they dealt with similar hardware configuration and compatibility issues.
  This is a stability/reliability fix for a driver initialization bug, not a security vulnerability fix.
5f55f21684322 s390/bpf: Store backchain even for leaf progs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a debugging/diagnostic issue, not a security vulnerability. The problem was that crash stack traces for "leaf" BPF programs (programs that don't call other functions) were incomplete because they didn't store the backchain pointer.
  2. **Only affects diagnostics**: The change only impacts the quality of stack traces when a BPF program crashes due to a bug. From the commit message, before the fix:
     ```
     [<000003ff600ebf00>] bpf_prog_6df0139e1fbf2789_fentry+0x20/0x78
     [<0000000000000000>] 0x0
     ```
     After the fix, you get a complete stack trace.
  3. **Code changes are minimal**: The changes remove the conditional check `(jit->seen & SEEN_FUNC)` from lines 608-609 and 615-616, making all BPF programs (not just those that call functions) store the backchain. This is purely for better debugging information.
  4. **No security impact**: Missing backchain information doesn't create any security vulnerability - it just makes debugging harder. The crash itself is what matters from a security perspective, not whether the stack trace is complete.
  5. **Matches standard compiler behavior**: The commit message notes "This is what GCC and Clang-generated code does as well" - it's aligning BPF JIT behavior with standard compilers for consistency.
  This is a quality-of-life improvement for developers debugging BPF programs, not a security fix.
9e7acf70cf6aa clk: qcom: gcc-msm8939: Fix mclk0 & mclk1 for 24 MHz
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** for CVE.
  Here's the explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit fixes incorrect clock parent mapping and frequency configuration for camera master clocks (mclk0 and mclk1). The change:
     - Fixes the parent map index for P_GPLL6 from 2 to 3 in `gcc_xo_gpll0_gpll1a_gpll6_sleep_map`
     - Changes the frequency table to use P_GPLL6 instead of P_GPLL0 for the 24 MHz rate
  2. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional correctness issue where:
     - The camera clocks were configured to use the wrong PLL source
     - This would result in incorrect clock frequencies for camera sensors
     - The impact is limited to camera functionality - incorrect clock rates would affect camera operation but don't expose any security vulnerabilities
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit follows the same pattern as the reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO" which fix:
     - Clock parent mapping issues (like commit 3414f41a13eb for gcc-sm6350)
     - Frequency table corrections (like commit b8acaf2de808 for gcc-sc8180x)
     - Missing clock configurations (like commit 818a2f8d5e4a for gcc-sc8180x)
  4. **No security-sensitive components affected**: The change only affects camera master clocks which control timing for camera sensors. This doesn't involve:
     - Memory management or access control
     - Privilege escalation paths
     - System integrity mechanisms
     - Data confidentiality concerns
  The fix ensures camera sensors receive the correct 24 MHz clock rate they expect, but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
1090c38bbfd9a dt-bindings: soc: fsl,qman-fqd: Fix reserved-memory.yaml reference
- [sasha] Now I understand. This commit is fixing:
  1. A YAML schema reference path issue - changing from relative to absolute path
  2. An incorrect compatible string in the example - changing from "shared-dma-pool" to "fsl,qman-fqd"
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a documentation-only change that fixes:
  1. An incorrect YAML schema reference path (`reserved-memory.yaml` → `/schemas/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.yaml`) in the device tree binding documentation
  2. A wrong compatible string in the example section (changing from `"shared-dma-pool"` to `"fsl,qman-fqd"`)
  These changes only affect device tree binding documentation and validation tools, not any runtime kernel code. Device tree bindings are specification documents that describe how device tree nodes should be structured. The fixes ensure proper schema validation and correct examples, but have no security implications or potential for exploitation.
3880cdbed1c46 bpf: Fix WARN() in get_bpf_raw_tp_regs
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and comparison with similar commits, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit only removes a WARN_ON_ONCE() that was triggering false positives. The actual bounds checking (`if (nest_level > ARRAY_SIZE(tp_regs->regs))`) remains intact, preventing any out-of-bounds access.
  2. **Defense Mechanism Preserved**: The error handling path is unchanged - it still returns -EBUSY and properly decrements the nest counter, maintaining the same security posture.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: 
     - The warning removal doesn't introduce memory corruption
     - Access to BPF requires CAP_BPF/CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges
     - The BPF verifier provides additional safety guarantees
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, warning removals in BPF code (like "bpf: Remove a WARN_ON_ONCE warning related to local kptr") are typically not assigned CVEs unless they fix actual security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Quality-of-Life Fix**: This is a quality improvement that prevents legitimate nested BPF programs from triggering spurious warnings, as shown in the syzkaller trace where normal BPF execution paths were hitting the warning.
  The commit is similar to other warning removal commits that improve system stability without addressing security vulnerabilities. It fixes a false positive warning while maintaining all safety checks, making it a bug fix rather than a security fix.
762ef7d1e6eef pinctrl: at91: Fix possible out-of-boundary access
- [sasha] The key information is that `of_alias_get_id()` can return negative values on error. Let me analyze the security impact:
  Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Protected by BUG_ON()**: The original code has `BUG_ON(alias_idx >= ARRAY_SIZE(gpio_chips))` at line 1828, which would catch any out-of-bounds access when alias_idx is >= MAX_GPIO_BANKS (5).
  2. **Negative values are not exploitable**: When `of_alias_get_id()` returns a negative error value (like -ENOSYS, -ENODEV), the subsequent array access `gpio_chips[alias_idx]` would access memory before the array start. However, this would immediately cause a kernel crash/oops, not an exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a driver probe function that runs in kernel context during device initialization. A malformed device tree that triggers this issue would require privileged access to modify the device tree in the first place.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (pinctrl: stm32) - array bounds check, NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 3 (pinctrl: at91) - adding missing functionality, NO CVE  
     - Similar Commit 4 (pinctrl: cy8c95x0) - off-by-one fix, NO CVE
     - Only Similar Commit 5 (pinctrl: nuvoton) got a CVE because it had an out-of-bounds WRITE before validation
  5. **Type of access**: This commit prevents a potential out-of-bounds READ (checking `if (gpio_chips[alias_idx])`), which is less severe than the out-of-bounds WRITE in Similar Commit 5.
  While this is a valid bug fix that improves code robustness, it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it requires privileged access to trigger and would cause an immediate, non-exploitable crash rather than a security vulnerability.
32b5361a0d106 pinctrl: qcom: correct the ngpios entry for QCS8300
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a configuration correction, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit simply corrects the `ngpios` value from 133 to 134 to properly account for the UFS_RESET pin.
  2. **No security impact**: Looking at the pin definitions, there are GPIOs 0-132 (133 GPIOs total) plus a special UFS_RESET pin at index 133. The ngpios field should be 134 to include this special pin. The incorrect value (133) would simply mean the UFS_RESET pin wouldn't be accessible as a GPIO, which is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This fix is very similar to the first two reference commits which were marked "CVE Status: NO". Those commits also fixed incorrect pin configuration values (memory offsets, tile assignments) without security implications.
  4. **No privilege escalation or memory safety issues**: Unlike the commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed incorrect memory offsets that could cause system crashes, this change only affects GPIO count configuration. There's no potential for memory corruption, crashes, or unauthorized access.
  5. **Functional limitation only**: The impact is limited to the UFS driver not being able to toggle the UFS_RESET pin if needed, which would be a functionality issue rather than a security concern.
  The commit is a simple off-by-one configuration fix that ensures all pins (including the special UFS_RESET pin) are properly counted in the GPIO range.
d18cdb975ba8a pinctrl: qcom: correct the ngpios entry for QCS615
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a Security Fix, But a Functional Fix**: The commit is correcting `ngpios` from 123 to 124 to properly include the UFS_RESET pin (pin 123) in the GPIO count. This is necessary for the UFS driver to access the reset pin through the GPIO API.
  2. **No Memory Corruption or Crashes**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commit (d3692d95cc4d) which fixed incorrect memory offsets that could "cause boards to crash", this change:
     - Does not fix any memory access violations
     - Does not prevent crashes or system instability
     - Does not fix any out-of-bounds access issues
  3. **Consistent with Established Pattern**: All other Qualcomm pinctrl drivers include UFS_RESET in their ngpios count (SM8150: 176, SM8250: 181, SM8350: 204, etc.). The original value of 123 was simply incorrect configuration.
  4. **Limited Security Impact**: The worst-case scenario with ngpios=123 is that:
     - The UFS driver cannot properly request the reset GPIO
     - UFS functionality might be impaired
     - This is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability
  5. **No Exploitable Condition**: The incorrect ngpios value doesn't create an exploitable condition that could lead to:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service through crashes
     - Memory corruption
  The change from 123 to 124 is a straightforward configuration correction to align with the hardware reality and driver requirements, similar to the non-CVE commit (5ed79863fae5) that fixed pin register configurations without security implications.
fd5fd538a1f4b libbpf: Use proper errno value in nlattr
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit is NOT a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **Error code consistency issue, not security**: The commit changes the return value from `-1` to `-EINVAL` in the `validate_nla()` function. This is purely about returning a more appropriate/standard errno value for better error reporting.
  2. **No security impact**: The validation logic itself is unchanged - the function still performs the same checks:
     - Validates attribute length against minimum required
     - Validates maximum length constraints  
     - Validates string null-termination
     
     The only change is the error code returned when validation fails.
  3. **User-visible improvement only**: As the commit message states, the return value "can be propagated all the way up to users of libbpf API" - so instead of seeing `-EPERM` (which comes from `-1`), users will see the more appropriate `-EINVAL`. This helps with debugging but has no security implications.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE) also changed error return values in libbpf from `-errno` to `-EINVAL`
     - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE) was about namespace conflicts
     - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE) was about fixing error handling
  5. **Unlike CVE commits**: The CVE-assigned commits (2 and 3) fixed actual security issues:
     - Commit 2 fixed invalid validation that could cause kernel warnings/crashes
     - Commit 3 fixed uninitialized memory reads
  This commit is a simple error code improvement for better API usability, not a security fix.
79f0c39ae7d3d ktls, sockmap: Fix missing uncharge operation
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Memory Accounting Vulnerability**: The bug results in a missing `sk_mem_uncharge()` operation when `tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()` fails. The code properly uncharges memory for the successfully sent portion via `sk_msg_return_zero()` but fails to uncharge the remaining `msg->sg.size` bytes in the error path.
  2. **Security Impact - Resource Exhaustion**: This creates a memory leak in the socket's memory accounting (`sk->sk_forward_alloc`). An attacker could exploit this by:
     - Creating ktls sockets with sockmap/BPF programs using `apply_bytes`
     - Intentionally causing send failures (e.g., by keeping the peer's buffer full)
     - Repeatedly triggering the bug to accumulate uncharged memory
     - Eventually exhausting socket memory limits, causing DoS
  3. **Similar CVE-Assigned Commits**: The reference commits show similar memory accounting fixes in tcp_bpf that were assigned CVEs:
     - "tcp_bpf: Fix the sk_mem_uncharge logic" - Fixed similar uncharge issues
     - "bpf, sockmap: Fix double uncharge the mem of sk_msg" - Fixed memory accounting bugs
     - "bpf, sockmap: Fix more uncharged while msg has more_data" - Fixed missing uncharge operations
     
  4. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability affects systems using:
     - Kernel TLS (ktls) with sockmap/BPF
     - BPF programs with `apply_bytes` parameter
     - This is increasingly common in production systems for TLS offload
  5. **Evidence from Code**: The fix adds `sk_mem_uncharge(sk, msg->sg.size)` in the error path after `tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()` fails, which confirms that memory remained charged despite the operation failing.
  The vulnerability allows local attackers (or potentially remote attackers in certain configurations) to cause memory exhaustion through repeated exploitation, leading to denial of service conditions.
493e6cb63a21e of: unittest: Unlock on error in unittest_data_add()
- [sasha] Now I understand - this is unittest code that runs during kernel initialization if enabled. Let me examine more carefully what happens with the mutex:
  **Analysis:**
  1. **Bug Type**: Missing mutex unlock on error path
  2. **Context**: This is in the device tree unittest code (`drivers/of/unittest.c`) in the `unittest_data_add()` function
  3. **What happens**: 
     - The function acquires `of_overlay_mutex_lock()` at the beginning
     - If `of_root` is NULL, the original code returns `-ENODEV` without releasing the mutex
     - This leaves the mutex locked indefinitely
  4. **Security Impact Assessment**:
     - This is test/unittest code that only runs during kernel initialization if OF_UNITTEST is enabled
     - The unittest runs with `late_initcall(of_unittest)` during boot
     - The mutex (`of_overlay_phandle_mutex`) is used to protect overlay operations
     - If the mutex remains locked, subsequent overlay operations would hang/deadlock
     - This is NOT a vulnerability that can be exploited by unprivileged users
     - It's a coding error that could cause a deadlock during kernel boot in test scenarios
  5. **Comparison with CVE examples**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a double-free vulnerability that could be triggered and cause memory corruption
     - Similar Commit 2 & 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a use-after-free race condition in binder that could be exploited
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: NO) - Fixed a mutex ordering bug in driver code
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: NO) - Fixed a bug in tooling/memory model testing code
  **Conclusion: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It only affects unittest/testing code that runs during kernel initialization
  2. It cannot be triggered by unprivileged users or through normal system operation
  3. It's a deadlock bug in test infrastructure, not a security vulnerability
  4. The impact is limited to kernel developers running tests, not production systems
  5. Similar to commit 4 & 5 which were also mutex/locking fixes in non-security-critical code and were marked as NO CVE
  The fix correctly adds proper error handling to ensure the mutex is always unlocked before returning from the function, but this is a code quality/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
c5dd28e7fb4f6 tracing: Fix error handling in event_trigger_parse()
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me check what's happening in the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a simple memory leak issue, not a security vulnerability. The bug is that when `event_trigger_alloc()` was introduced to replace direct `kzalloc()` calls, the corresponding deallocation calls were not properly updated from `kfree()` to use the proper cleanup function.
  The key differences between `kfree()` and `trigger_data_free()` are:
  1. `trigger_data_free()` properly cleans up any attached filters via `set_filter(NULL, data, NULL)`
  2. `trigger_data_free()` calls `tracepoint_synchronize_unregister()` to ensure triggers exit before freeing
  3. Only then does it call `kfree(data)`
  However, this is a resource leak, not a security vulnerability:
  - The leaked memory is in error paths (lines 998 and 1025) that occur during trigger setup failures
  - There's no memory corruption, use-after-free, or other exploitable condition
  - The impact is limited to gradual memory exhaustion if an attacker could repeatedly trigger these error paths
  - The leaked resources would require privileged access to the tracing subsystem to trigger
  Unlike the similar commits with CVE status YES which fixed use-after-free bugs or corruption issues that could lead to crashes or privilege escalation, this commit only fixes a memory leak in error handling paths.
f2947c4b7d0f2 tracing: Rename event_trigger_alloc() to trigger_data_alloc()
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis, here is my final determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No actual memory corruption or security vulnerability**: While the commit message states "This naming convention was introducing bugs," my analysis shows these were coding mistakes where developers used `kfree()` directly instead of the proper cleanup function. However, examining the `trigger_data_free()` function shows it only does:
     - Calls `set_filter(NULL)` if the command ops has a set_filter function
     - Calls `tracepoint_synchronize_unregister()` 
     - Then calls `kfree()`
  2. **Limited security impact**: The bugs introduced by the naming confusion would primarily cause:
     - Potential filter cleanup to be skipped (minor memory leak of filter data)
     - Missing synchronization before free (theoretical race condition)
     
     These are quality issues rather than exploitable vulnerabilities.
  3. **No evidence of exploitation**: There's no indication in the commit message or surrounding commits that this was actively exploited or caused security breaches.
  4. **API clarification, not vulnerability fix**: This is fundamentally an API documentation/naming fix to prevent future coding errors, similar to the non-CVE commits shown in the examples (commits 1-3).
  5. **Comparison to CVE commits**: Unlike commits 4 and 5 which fixed actual use-after-free bugs with clear security implications and reproducer steps, this commit is preventative maintenance to improve code clarity.
  The commit improves code quality and prevents potential future bugs, but does not fix an actual security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
cf15cdc0f0f39 selftests/bpf: Fix caps for __xlated/jited_unpriv
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE.
  Let me examine the code changes and commit message:
  **What the commit does:**
  1. Moves the `restore_capabilities(&caps)` call earlier in the execution flow
  2. The call is moved from inside the `should_do_test_run()` conditional block to right after the program is loaded
  3. This ensures capabilities are restored before calling `get_xlated_program_text()` or `get_jited_program_text()`
  **What the bug was:**
  - The BPF syscall would overwrite `info.jited_prog_len` and `info.xlated_prog_len` with 0 if the process is not `bpf_capable()`
  - This prevented `__xlated_unpriv` and `__jited_unpriv` test features from working correctly
  - The bug was not noticed because no tests actually used these features
  **Security implications:**
  This is purely a test framework bug in the BPF selftests. The issue only affects:
  1. Test execution in the selftests framework
  2. The ability to retrieve program disassembly for testing purposes
  3. No impact on the actual kernel BPF subsystem or production systems
  The commit is fixing test infrastructure, not a security vulnerability in the kernel itself. The "capabilities" being restored are only relevant within the test harness context to allow proper testing of unprivileged BPF programs.
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It only affects the BPF selftest framework, not the kernel's BPF implementation
  2. There is no security vulnerability - just broken test functionality
  3. No privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impact
  4. The fix is purely to make test features work correctly that were previously non-functional
  5. Similar to the other selftest-related commits in the reference set that were marked "CVE Status: NO"
6e492ffcab606 selftests/bpf: Avoid passing out-of-range values to __retval()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit only modifies BPF selftests and does not fix any security vulnerability in the kernel. The code changes are entirely in `tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/` which are test programs, not kernel code.
  The issue being fixed is that the test was passing 64-bit values (like `0x1234567890abcdef`) to `__retval()`, but looking at the test infrastructure code in `test_loader.c`, the `parse_int()` function stores the parsed value in an `int *val`, which truncates to 32 bits. The tests were still passing because only the lower 32 bits were being checked.
  The commit restructures the tests to properly verify 64-bit values by comparing them within the test rather than relying on the `__retval()` macro. This is purely a test improvement to ensure the tests are actually validating what they intend to validate. No kernel functionality or security is affected.
c8e1927e7f7d6 efi/libstub: Describe missing 'out' parameter in efi_load_initrd
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a documentation fix that adds a missing kernel-doc parameter description for the 'out' parameter in the `efi_load_initrd()` function. The only change is adding a single line to the comment block: `* @out: pointer to store the address of the initrd table`.
  2. **No code changes**: The actual executable code remains completely unchanged. This fix only modifies documentation comments, which have no impact on runtime behavior, security, or functionality.
  3. **Compiler warning fix**: The commit addresses a harmless compiler documentation warning about missing parameter documentation. This is a code quality/documentation improvement, not a security fix.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE Status: YES) fixed an actual memory management bug where the wrong pointer was being freed
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) also fixed a memory management issue with incorrect pointer handling
     - This commit, in contrast, makes no changes to memory handling or any executable code
  5. **Security impact**: There is zero security impact from this change as it only affects documentation that is parsed by documentation tools, not the compiled kernel binary.
  This is a routine documentation maintenance commit with no security implications whatsoever.
8020361d51eea rtla: Define _GNU_SOURCE in timerlat_bpf.c
- [sasha] Now let me look at the similar commits provided to understand the pattern.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a build compatibility issue between rtla (a userspace tool) and newer glibc versions. The missing `_GNU_SOURCE` definition causes incorrect struct alignment due to different `struct sched_attr` definitions, leading to functional failure in BPF histogram collection.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The code changes show this only affects:
     - Reading incorrect offset values within the same user-controlled structure (`params->entries` read as 0)
     - Graceful disabling of histogram functionality when entries=0
     - No memory corruption, information leakage, or privilege escalation possible
  3. **Similar Commit Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits:
     - Commit 1 (tools/rtla: fix collision with glibc) - CVE Status: NO
     - Commit 3 (sched/headers: Move 'struct sched_param') - CVE Status: NO
     
     These are all userspace tool compatibility fixes with glibc, not kernel security issues.
  4. **Failure Mode**: When the bug triggers, the tool simply reports "Error pulling BPF data" and continues without histogram functionality - a clean degradation, not a security failure.
  5. **Scope**: This only affects rtla, a userspace analysis tool for real-time Linux. It doesn't affect kernel security boundaries or system integrity.
  The fix adding `#define _GNU_SOURCE` ensures consistent struct definitions between rtla and glibc, restoring proper functionality but not addressing any security vulnerability.
8f7561209eda7 wifi: iwlfiwi: mvm: Fix the rate reporting
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I have the complete picture. The key insight is that with the validation check added by commit 3e99b4d28219, if `ieee80211_rate_valid()` returns false (because count is 0), then `sta_set_rate_info_tx()` is NOT called. This means the out-of-bounds access I identified earlier is actually prevented by this validation.
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional bug that causes missing rate statistics in userspace tools, not a security issue. The validation check `ieee80211_rate_valid()` prevents any potentially dangerous code paths from being executed.
  2. **No Security Impact**: When the rate is invalid (count=0), the code simply skips reporting TX bitrate statistics. This results in:
     - Missing rate information in `iw` command output
     - No TX bitrate shown in network monitoring tools
     - But NO security consequences like crashes, memory corruption, or information disclosure
  3. **Validation Prevents Issues**: The referenced commit (3e99b4d28219) that added `ieee80211_rate_valid()` actually prevents security issues by ensuring that `sta_set_rate_info_tx()` is only called with valid rates. Without this fix, the rate simply won't be reported.
  4. **Similar to Commit 1**: This is similar to the first reference commit which also added rate index validity checks but was marked as "CVE Status: NO" because it was defensive programming rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
  The fix simply ensures that the driver-reported optimal rate passes validation by setting count=1, allowing statistics to be properly reported to userspace. This is a quality-of-service fix, not a security fix.
7a0c1872ee7db clk: test: Forward-declare struct of_phandle_args in kunit/clk.h
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is a simple compiler warning fix that adds a forward declaration for `struct of_phandle_args` in a header file. The change:
  1. **Does not fix a security vulnerability** - It only resolves a compiler warning about an incomplete type declaration
  2. **Has no security impact** - The warning occurs because the struct is used in a function parameter list without being declared first, which is a code quality/compilation issue, not a security issue
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits** - The pattern matches "Similar Commit 1" which fixed a nearly identical issue with `struct completion` forward declaration and was marked as NO CVE
  4. **Only affects compilation** - This is purely a build-time issue that prevents proper header inclusion in certain scenarios
  The fix is purely cosmetic and ensures proper compilation when the header is included without other headers that define `struct of_phandle_args`. It has no runtime impact and introduces no security-relevant changes.
73c46d9a93d07 clk: bcm: rpi: Add NULL check in raspberrypi_clk_register()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparison with similar commits, here is my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a clear NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. When `devm_kasprintf()` fails and returns NULL, the code continues to use `init.name` without checking, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when the clock is registered via `devm_clk_hw_register()`.
  2. **Pattern Matches CVE-Assigned Commits**: This commit follows the exact same pattern as the similar commits that were assigned CVEs:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL dereference when `dev` is NULL in `clk_hw_get_clk()`
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL check after `devm_kzalloc()` 
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL dereference from `kmalloc()` failure
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL dereference in `clk_core_get()`
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()`
  3. **Security Impact**: While the kernel's `kstrdup()` function does check for NULL and prevents an immediate crash, the error handling is incorrect (returns -ENOMEM instead of -EINVAL), and there are potential issues in error paths and debug messages that assume `core->name` is valid.
  4. **Memory Allocation Failure**: The vulnerability is triggered by memory allocation failure in `devm_kasprintf()`, which can occur under memory pressure conditions, making this a potential denial-of-service vector.
  5. **Affected Component**: This affects the Raspberry Pi clock driver, which is used in production systems and could impact system stability if triggered.
  The fix is straightforward and correct - adding a NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()` and returning -ENOMEM if allocation fails, preventing the NULL pointer from being passed to the clock registration framework.
43745d11bfd96 bpftool: Fix regression of "bpftool cgroup tree" EINVAL on older kernels
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a functional regression in bpftool (a userspace utility), not a security vulnerability. The change simply restores error handling logic to ignore EINVAL errors when querying unsupported attach types on older kernels.
  The key evidence:
  1. **Userspace tool issue**: bpftool is a diagnostic/management tool, not kernel code
  2. **No security impact**: The fix only changes error handling from `if (count < 0)` to `if (count < 0 && errno != EINVAL)` to allow the tool to continue working when it encounters unsupported attach types
  3. **Pure compatibility fix**: The issue only affects functionality when running newer bpftool on older kernels - there's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security concerns
  This contrasts with the "CVE Status: YES" examples which involved actual security issues like missing attach type enforcement checks in kernel BPF subsystem code that could allow incorrect program attachments.
d988b0b866c2a clk: qcom: gpucc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Hardware Configuration Fix**: The commit adds hardware-specific timing values (`en_rest_wait_val`, `en_few_wait_val`, `clk_dis_wait_val`) for GPU power domain state controllers (GDSCs). These values control wait periods during power state transitions.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The code changes only set timing parameters to match hardware specifications. Without these values, the GDSC driver uses defaults (0x2, 0x8, 0x2 respectively from gdsc.c). The commit sets them to (0x2, 0x2, 0x8) for gpu_cx_gdsc and (0x2, 0x2, 0x2) for gpu_gx_gdsc.
  3. **Functional Issue Only**: As shown in similar commits like 211681998d70, incorrect wait values can cause "GDSC FSM state stuck causing power on/off failures". This is a reliability/stability issue where the GPU power domains may fail to transition properly, but it doesn't create any exploitable security condition.
  4. **No Attack Vector**: These timing values are internal kernel configurations for hardware control. There's no way for unprivileged users to manipulate these values or exploit incorrect settings to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause memory corruption.
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve GDSC wait value corrections or flag updates, and none were assigned CVEs because they are hardware configuration corrections, not security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is simply ensuring the hardware operates with correct timing parameters to prevent power sequencing failures - a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
afdfd829a99e4 clk: qcom: gcc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This commit adds timing configuration values (`en_rest_wait_val`, `en_few_wait_val`, `clk_dis_wait_val`) to GDSC (Globally Distributed Switch Controller) structures. These are wait/delay values used during power domain transitions.
  2. **Default vs explicit values**: According to the code analysis:
     - The mainline GDSC driver has defaults: `EN_REST_WAIT_VAL=0x2`, `EN_FEW_WAIT_VAL=0x8`, `CLK_DIS_WAIT_VAL=0x2`
     - This commit explicitly sets: `en_rest_wait_val=0x2`, `en_few_wait_val=0x2`, `clk_dis_wait_val=0xf`
     - For most values, it's just making explicit what was already implicit
  3. **No security impact**: These timing values affect power domain state transitions, not security boundaries. Incorrect values might cause hardware initialization issues or power management problems, but don't create exploitable vulnerabilities.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (gcc-sa8775p, gpucc-sa8775p) show the same pattern - adding wait_val fields to prevent "GDSC FSM state stuck" issues. None of these were assigned CVEs because they fix functional/reliability issues, not security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Commit message indicates functional fix**: The message states these values prevent "GDSC FSM state to be stuck causing failures to power on/off", which is a reliability/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  This is a standard hardware configuration correction that ensures proper power domain transitions, similar to fixing timing parameters or hardware initialization sequences.
673989d271236 clk: qcom: dispcc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Configuration correction, not a security vulnerability**: The commit adds timing wait values (`en_rest_wait_val`, `en_few_wait_val`, `clk_dis_wait_val`) to match hardware reset values. These are timing parameters for power domain state transitions.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only affects power domain timing during transitions. There's no:
     - Memory corruption or overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote code execution potential
  3. **Similar commits marked NO**: The referenced similar commits (be208c0ccf7d, 211681998d70) that also update GDSC wait_val fields were marked as NO for CVE assignment.
  4. **Functional fix**: While the commit message mentions that incorrect values could cause "GDSC FSM state to be stuck", this is a functional issue affecting power management, not a security vulnerability. The worst case is that display components might fail to power on/off correctly.
  5. **Hardware configuration alignment**: The commit explicitly states it's setting "reset value of those bits", meaning it's aligning the driver with hardware defaults rather than fixing a security flaw.
  The change is a proper configuration fix to ensure reliable power domain transitions for the display subsystem, but does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities.
e7b1c13280ad8 clk: qcom: camcc-sm6350: Add *_wait_val values for GDSCs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds wait timing values (`en_rest_wait_val`, `en_few_wait_val`, `clk_dis_wait_val`) to GDSC (Globally Distributed Switch Controller) structures in the camera clock controller driver. These values control transition delays between power states.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a configuration correction that ensures proper hardware timing values are used. The values being set (0x2, 0x2, 0xf) match the reset values mentioned in the commit message.
  3. **Impact is functional, not security-related**: Without these values, the GDSC driver would use default values (0x2, 0x8, 0x2) instead of the hardware-specific reset values. This could potentially cause timing issues or power state transition problems, but doesn't create any security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (e.g., "clk: qcom: gcc-sa8775p: Update the GDSC wait_val fields and flags"), these types of GDSC timing corrections are routine driver fixes that don't receive CVEs.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: The change doesn't introduce or fix any condition that could be exploited by an attacker. It's purely a hardware configuration correction to ensure proper power domain sequencing.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for ensuring correct hardware timing values are used, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
7ab0fc61ce730 tracing: Move histogram trigger variables from stack to per CPU structure
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the commit information provided:
  **Analysis of the commit:**
  1. **Nature of the change**: This commit moves large arrays from the kernel stack to a per-CPU structure in the histogram trigger code.
  2. **Problem being fixed**: The commit addresses excessive kernel stack usage (816 bytes) in the `event_hist_trigger()` function due to three large arrays:
     - `unsigned long entries[HIST_STACKTRACE_DEPTH]`
     - `u64 var_ref_vals[TRACING_MAP_VARS_MAX]`
     - `char compound_key[HIST_KEY_SIZE_MAX]`
  3. **Security implications**: 
     - **Stack exhaustion risk**: Using 816 bytes on the kernel stack is dangerous because the kernel has limited stack space (typically 8KB or 16KB). Excessive stack usage can lead to stack overflow, which could cause:
       - Kernel crashes (DoS)
       - Potential memory corruption if stack overflow occurs
       - System instability
     
  4. **The fix**: The commit allocates per-CPU structures to hold these arrays, reducing stack usage from 816 bytes to 112 bytes.
  5. **Referenced commit**: The Fixes tag references commit 067fe038e70f6 ("tracing: Add variable reference handling to hist triggers"), indicating this issue was introduced when variable reference handling was added.
  **CVE Assessment:**
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Reasoning:**
  1. **Security vulnerability**: The excessive kernel stack usage (816 bytes per invocation) creates a real risk of kernel stack exhaustion, especially in deeply nested call chains or under certain workloads.
  2. **Exploitability**: An attacker who can trigger histogram events (through tracing infrastructure) could potentially cause stack exhaustion leading to:
     - Denial of Service through kernel panic
     - Possible memory corruption if stack guards are bypassed
  3. **Clear security fix**: The commit explicitly addresses a resource exhaustion issue (stack space) that has security implications.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-worthy issues**: Stack exhaustion vulnerabilities in the kernel are regularly assigned CVEs as they can lead to system crashes or worse.
  The fact that this moves from 816 bytes to 112 bytes (a reduction of over 700 bytes) shows this was a significant stack usage issue that needed addressing for security/stability reasons.
be5a2d3f8f973 iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Fix incorrect return in arm_smmu_attach_dev
- [sasha] Now I can see the critical issue. When `smmu_domain->smmu != smmu`, the function returns 0 (success) but doesn't actually perform any attachment. This means:
  1. The function returns success without actually configuring the IOMMU
  2. The device would continue using whatever IOMMU configuration it had before
  3. VFIO relies on getting -EINVAL to know that the domain is incompatible
  This is a significant security issue because:
  1. **Domain Isolation Bypass**: VFIO uses domain compatibility checks to ensure proper isolation between different IOMMU domains. If the attach operation falsely succeeds when domains are incompatible, it could lead to improper isolation between VMs or containers.
  2. **Incorrect IOMMU Configuration**: The device would not be properly attached to the intended domain, potentially leaving it in an insecure state or attached to the wrong domain.
  3. **VFIO Security Model Broken**: VFIO's security model depends on proper error handling from the IOMMU subsystem to maintain isolation. This bug breaks that assumption.
  Looking at the similar commits:
  - Similar commits 1 & 2 (NO CVE): Were simple error checking fixes without security implications
  - Similar commits 3, 4 & 5 (YES CVE): Were reference counting leaks, NULL pointer dereferences, and type confusion that could lead to crashes or security issues
  This commit is more similar to the CVE-assigned commits because it:
  1. Breaks a security boundary (domain isolation in VFIO)
  2. Can lead to incorrect security-critical configurations
  3. Affects the integrity of the IOMMU subsystem which is fundamental to virtualization security
  **Answer: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a security vulnerability where the ARM SMMU-v3 driver incorrectly returns success (0) instead of -EINVAL when attempting to attach a device to an incompatible IOMMU domain. This breaks VFIO's domain compatibility checking, potentially allowing improper domain attachments that could compromise isolation between virtual machines or containers. The bug could lead to security boundary violations in virtualization environments where proper IOMMU domain isolation is critical for security.
41d4ce6df3f49 bpf: Fix uninitialized values in BPF_{CORE,PROBE}_READ
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Build-time issue only**: This is a compilation error that occurs with newer LLVM/GCC compilers when building BPF programs. The error message shows it's a compile-time warning about "default initialization" being incompatible with C++.
  2. **No runtime security impact**: The issue is that `typeof()` preserves const qualifiers from intermediate types, causing the macro to declare `const unsigned int __r;` which C++ requires to be initialized at declaration. However, the very next line in the macro expansion calls `BPF_CORE_READ_INTO(&__r, ...)` which properly initializes the variable before it's used.
  3. **No uninitialized memory exposure**: The variable `__r` is always initialized by the `BPF_CORE_READ_INTO()` call before being returned. The compiler warning is about the declaration syntax, not about actual uninitialized memory usage.
  4. **Similar to non-security fixes**: Looking at similar commits 3 and 4 which have "CVE Status: NO", they also fix compilation issues and warnings without security implications.
  5. **Purpose of the fix**: The fix simply uses `__typeof_unqual__` (when available) instead of `typeof()` to strip const qualifiers from the type, allowing the temporary variable to be declared without initialization, which satisfies newer compiler requirements.
  This is a build/compatibility fix to allow BPF programs to compile with newer toolchains, not a security vulnerability fix.
5d2ea5aebbb2f RDMA/mlx5: Fix error flow upon firmware failure for RQ destruction
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the code changes in the commit to understand the vulnerability better. Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a use-after-free vulnerability, as evidenced by the kernel trace showing "refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free." This is a serious security vulnerability class.
  2. **Resource Management Flaw**: The bug occurs in the RQ (Receive Queue) destruction error path. When `destroy_rq_tracked()` fails (the firmware command fails), the original code had already cleaned up SW resources via `destroy_resource_common()`. This creates a situation where:
     - The resource is removed from the radix tree
     - The refcount is decremented 
     - The resource is potentially freed
     - But the RQ still exists in firmware
  3. **Double-Free Scenario**: If someone tries to destroy the RQ again after the initial failure, they would access already-freed memory, leading to the use-after-free condition shown in the trace.
  4. **Security Impact**: Use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to:
     - Cause system crashes (DoS)
     - Potentially achieve privilege escalation or code execution depending on how the freed memory is reused
  5. **The Fix**: The commit introduces an `invalid` flag in the `mlx5_core_rsc_common` structure and modifies the flow to:
     - Mark the resource as invalid before attempting firmware destruction
     - Only proceed with SW cleanup if firmware destruction succeeds
     - Restore the valid state if firmware destruction fails
     - The `mlx5_get_rsc()` function now checks the `invalid` flag to prevent accessing invalid resources
  The vulnerability affects the RDMA/InfiniBand subsystem which is commonly used in high-performance computing and datacenter environments, making it a significant security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
7590649ee7af3 IB/cm: Drop lockdep assert and WARN when freeing old msg
- [sasha] Based on the commit message and code changes provided, let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a fix for a recent regression introduced by commit 1e5159219076 ("IB/cm: Do not hold reference on cm_id unless needed"). The current commit drops a lockdep assert and WARN that were incorrectly triggered.
  2. **Issue description**: The problem occurs when the send completion handler runs after a cm_id has moved to a different state/message. In this case:
     - The old message (msg) might not match cm_id_priv->msg anymore
     - The original code was calling cm_free_priv_msg() which has assertions that the lock is held and that msg == cm_id_priv->msg
     - These assertions are invalid for old/stale messages
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     ```c
     if (msg != cm_id_priv->msg) {
         spin_unlock_irq(&cm_id_priv->lock);
     -   cm_free_priv_msg(msg);
     +   cm_free_msg(msg);
     +   cm_deref_id(cm_id_priv);
         return;
     }
     ```
     The change replaces cm_free_priv_msg() with cm_free_msg() plus explicit cm_deref_id() for the case where we're dealing with an old message.
  4. **Security impact**: None. This is:
     - Not fixing a memory corruption issue
     - Not fixing a use-after-free (it's actually maintaining proper reference counting)
     - Not fixing any access control bypass
     - Not fixing any information leak
     - Simply removing incorrect debug assertions (lockdep_assert_held and WARN_ON)
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 2 and 4 (CVE Status: YES) involve actual use-after-free vulnerabilities
     - This commit is fundamentally different - it's not fixing a use-after-free but rather fixing incorrect debug assertions
  This is a correctness fix for debugging/warning code, not a security vulnerability fix.
4c5c6aa9967db netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit's key changes. The commit adds a new function `lt_calculate_size()` that performs overflow checks when calculating the lookup table size. Here's my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Integer Overflow Vulnerability**: The original code in lines 722-724 (before the patch) performs multiplication without overflow checks:
     ```c
     new_lt = kvzalloc(f->groups * NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) *
                       new_bucket_size * sizeof(*new_lt) +
                       NFT_PIPAPO_ALIGN_HEADROOM, GFP_KERNEL);
     ```
     This multiplication could overflow, leading to an undersized allocation.
  2. **Security Impact**: As noted in the commit message:
     - `desc->field_len[]` maximum value is U8_MAX (255) multiplied by NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) (can be 2)
     - NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8 = 256 in worst case
     - sizeof(unsigned long) is 8 bytes on 64-bit systems
     - The multiplication `groups * buckets * bsize * sizeof(long)` could overflow
  3. **Memory Corruption Potential**: An integer overflow in the allocation size calculation would result in:
     - Undersized buffer allocation via `kvzalloc()`
     - Subsequent operations would write beyond the allocated buffer
     - This could lead to kernel memory corruption, potentially exploitable for privilege escalation
  4. **Multiple Vulnerable Locations**: The patch fixes overflow issues in three functions:
     - `pipapo_resize()` - lines 722-724
     - `pipapo_lt_bits_adjust()` - lines 920-921, 927-928
     - `pipapo_clone()` - lines 1455-1457
  5. **Exploitability**: This vulnerability could be triggered by:
     - A local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
     - Creating netfilter rules with specific field configurations that trigger the overflow
  The commit properly addresses this by introducing `lt_calculate_size()` which uses `check_mul_overflow()` and `check_add_overflow()` to safely calculate the allocation size, preventing integer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to kernel memory corruption.
bfe7cfb65c753 netfilter: nft_quota: match correctly when the quota just depleted
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze the security implications:
  1. **The Bug**: The quota system had an off-by-one error where it would stop matching (NFT_BREAK) when consumed bytes equal the quota, instead of when they exceed it. This means the last packet that brings the total to exactly the quota limit would be incorrectly blocked.
  2. **Functionality Impact**: This is a functional bug where:
     - Users expect quota to allow traffic up to and including the quota limit
     - But it was stopping one byte early (at quota-1)
     - This could cause legitimate traffic to be dropped prematurely
  3. **Security Analysis**:
     - This is primarily a functionality issue, not a security vulnerability
     - It doesn't allow bypassing security policies - it's actually more restrictive than intended
     - It doesn't cause memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - The bug makes the quota more strict, not less strict
     - No attacker can exploit this to gain unauthorized access or cause system compromise
  4. **Similar Commits Analysis**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Logic fix for interval matching - functionality issue
     - Similar Commit 2 (YES CVE): Information leak - copying uninitialized memory to userspace
     - Similar Commit 3 & 4 (YES CVE): Bounds check before skb_checksum() to prevent BUG_ON() - can cause DoS
     - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Missing expiration checks - functionality issue
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a functional bug that causes the quota matching to be off by one byte, making it more restrictive than intended. This doesn't create any security vulnerability - it doesn't allow bypassing security controls, cause memory corruption, enable privilege escalation, or leak information. It's purely a logic error that affects the correctness of quota enforcement but has no security impact.
aa04c6f45b922 netfilter: bridge: Move specific fragmented packet to slow_path instead of dropping it
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It addresses a functional issue where packets were being dropped when they should have been processed through an alternative path.
  2. **Behavioral Optimization, Not Security Fix**: The change moves packets from being dropped (goto blackhole) to being processed through the slow_path when there's insufficient headroom. This is a functional improvement that prevents legitimate packets from being dropped unnecessarily.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The original code would drop packets with insufficient headroom, which could affect network functionality but does not create an exploitable security condition. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond normal packet drops
  4. **Fixes Tag Context**: While the commit references "Fixes: 3c171f496ef5", this is fixing a functional regression, not a security issue. The original implementation was overly conservative in dropping packets.
  5. **Code Pattern**: The changes follow a consistent pattern in both IPv4 and IPv6 code:
     - Changed from: `if (condition1 || condition2) goto blackhole;`
     - Changed to: `if (condition1) goto blackhole; if (condition2) goto slow_path;`
     
     This allows packets with insufficient headroom to be processed through the linearization path instead of being dropped.
  The commit improves packet handling behavior in bridge netfilter fragmentation but does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
714070c4cb7a1 bpf: Allow XDP dev-bound programs to perform XDP_REDIRECT into maps
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functionality fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit enables dev-bound XDP programs to perform XDP_REDIRECT into DEVMAP/CPUMAP, which was previously blocked.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The original restriction was overly conservative. The comment in the code states "XDP programs inserted into maps are not guaranteed to run on a particular netdev". The fix still maintains this restriction - dev-bound programs cannot be inserted into maps. However, it allows dev-bound programs already running in driver context to redirect packets into maps, which is safe.
  3. **No privilege escalation or access control bypass**: The change doesn't allow unprivileged operations or bypass any security checks. It's refining an existing restriction to be more precise.
  4. **Functional improvement, not vulnerability fix**: The commit message clearly states this fixes the ability to perform XDP_REDIRECT, not a security issue. The original behavior was blocking a legitimate use case where dev-bound programs running in driver NAPI context should be able to redirect packets.
  5. **Safe operation**: The key insight is that the program is already executing in the driver context with appropriate privileges. The redirect operation itself doesn't change the security context or allow access to resources that weren't already available.
  The original check was preventing all dev-bound programs from interacting with maps in any way, which was too restrictive. This fix allows the redirect operation while still preventing dev-bound programs from being inserted into maps where they could run on different devices.
358b1c0f56ebb libbpf: Use proper errno value in linker
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code changes and understanding of the libbpf library:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit only changes error return values from `-1` to `-EINVAL`. This is a minor cosmetic/usability fix that improves error reporting clarity, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Error Handling Improvement**: The code changes at lines 1379 and 2226 simply replace:
     - `return -1;` with `return -EINVAL;`
     
     This makes the error code more meaningful (-EINVAL = "Invalid argument" vs -1 = -EPERM = "Operation not permitted").
  3. **No Security Impact**: The error paths being modified are for cases where:
     - ELF sections are incompatible during linking
     - Sections don't match expected properties
     
     These are normal error conditions in the linker, not security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they also fix error handling and return values in libbpf (e.g., fixing segfaults, proper errno handling, byte-order issues) but were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are bug fixes, not security vulnerability fixes.
  5. **User-space Library**: This is a user-space library (libbpf) used for BPF program manipulation. The error code change doesn't introduce or fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant issues.
  The commit is purely a quality improvement that provides more accurate error codes to library users, which helps with debugging but has no security implications.
38d976c32d85e selftests/bpf: Fix kmem_cache iterator draining
- [sasha] Let me look more carefully at the code change in the provided diff:
  From the diff provided, line 107 changes from:
  ```c
  while (read(iter_fd, buf, sizeof(buf) > 0)) {
  ```
  to:
  ```c
  while (read(iter_fd, buf, sizeof(buf)) > 0) {
  ```
  This is a simple syntax error where the closing parenthesis for the `read()` call was misplaced. In the buggy version, `sizeof(buf) > 0` would evaluate to 1 (true), so the read would only read 1 byte at a time instead of 256 bytes.
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  **Explanation:**
  This commit fixes a performance issue in a BPF selftest, not a security vulnerability. The bug causes inefficient single-byte reads instead of buffer-sized reads when draining the kmem_cache iterator during testing. This:
  1. Only affects test code (selftests/bpf/), not production kernel code
  2. Has no security implications - it's purely a performance inefficiency
  3. Doesn't affect memory safety, access control, or any security boundaries
  4. Simply makes the test run slower by performing many 1-byte reads instead of 256-byte reads
  The misplaced parenthesis causes `read(iter_fd, buf, sizeof(buf) > 0)` to become `read(iter_fd, buf, 1)` since `sizeof(buf) > 0` evaluates to 1. While this is a bug, it's a benign performance issue in test code with no security impact.
eed848871c96d crypto/krb5: Fix change to use SG miter to use offset
- [sasha] Now I'll analyze the security implications of this bug. Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No current security impact**: The commit message explicitly states "Nothing in linus/master uses the krb5lib, though the bug is there. It is used by AF_RXRPC's RxGK implementation in -next, no need to backport." This means the vulnerable code is not yet used in any released kernel.
  2. **Bug nature**: The bug is a missing offset calculation (`sg_miter_skip(&miter, offset)`) when iterating through a scatterlist for cryptographic hash operations. While this causes incorrect MIC (Message Integrity Code) calculations, it results in:
     - Test failures (as shown by the selftest error)
     - Functional incorrectness rather than a security vulnerability
     - The MIC verification would fail, preventing acceptance of incorrectly processed messages
  3. **Limited scope**: The bug only affects "packet signing modes and not full encryption" as stated in the commit message. The full encryption path uses different code (authenc and krb5enc drivers).
  4. **Not exploitable**: The bug causes deterministic failures in MIC calculations that would be caught by verification, not a weakness that could be exploited to bypass security checks or gain unauthorized access.
  5. **Development code**: The affected code is part of ongoing development (RxGK implementation in -next) that hasn't reached production systems.
  This is a functional bug fix for code that isn't yet deployed, similar to the other "NO CVE" examples that fix calculation errors, offset mistakes, or functional issues without security implications.
42d033cf4b517 scsi: smartpqi: Fix smp_processor_id() call trace for preemptible kernels
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a kernel debugging/correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes a warning/call trace that occurs when `smp_processor_id()` is called in preemptible context. This is a programming correctness issue, not a security flaw.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue only causes a warning message and call trace when CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is enabled. It doesn't lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Any other security-relevant impact
  3. **Performance statistics only**: The affected code is only updating performance counters (`write_stream_cnt` and `raid_bypass_cnt`). These are statistics used for monitoring, not for any security-critical decisions or access control.
  4. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits:
     - "perf/x86: Fix smp_processor_id()-in-preemptible warnings" (NO CVE)
     - These are debugging/correctness fixes
  5. **Raw vs regular smp_processor_id()**: The fix simply changes from `smp_processor_id()` to `raw_smp_processor_id()`. The "raw" version doesn't include preemption checks. Since the CPU ID is only used for per-CPU statistics counters, getting a potentially "wrong" CPU ID (if preemption occurs) doesn't impact correctness or security - it only affects which CPU's counter gets incremented.
  This is a code quality/correctness fix that eliminates warning messages in debug kernels, not a security vulnerability fix.
b5162bb6aa1ec scsi: lpfc: Avoid potential ndlp use-after-free in dev_loss_tmo_callbk
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with similar commits, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No actual vulnerability exploited**: The commit fixes a potential use-after-free that was reported by a static analysis tool (Smatch), not an actual exploitable vulnerability. The commit message states "Smatch detected a potential use-after-free" indicating this was caught by static analysis before becoming exploitable.
  2. **Code reordering fix**: The fix merely reorders code to avoid a theoretical use-after-free scenario. Looking at the changes:
     - The old code checked `nvme_reg` after potentially freeing `ndlp` via `lpfc_nlp_put(ndlp)`
     - The new code uses `drop_initial_node_ref` flag to defer the `lpfc_nlp_put()` call until after all references to `ndlp` are complete
  3. **Defensive programming**: This is a defensive programming fix to address a code quality issue found by static analysis, not a fix for an actual security vulnerability that could be exploited.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: 
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE) also dealt with reference counting in dev_loss_tmo_callbk but was not assigned a CVE
     - Similar Commits 2, 3, and 4 (YES CVE) fixed actual use-after-free conditions that could occur during normal operation, not just theoretical issues found by static analysis
  5. **Impact assessment**: The commit is fixing a potential issue introduced by a previous commit (4281f44ea8bf) that itself was not assigned a CVE, suggesting this is more of a code quality improvement than a security fix.
  The key distinction is that this commit addresses a potential issue found by static analysis tools before it became an actual exploitable vulnerability, making it a preventive code quality fix rather than a security vulnerability fix warranting a CVE.
dc6d9ef57fcf4 f2fs: zone: fix to calculate first_zoned_segno correctly
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to determine if this fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE.
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: While this is indeed a bug in calculating `first_zoned_segno` (now `first_seq_zone_segno`), the actual impact is limited to incorrect zone type identification that would primarily cause functional failures rather than exploitable security issues.
  2. **Limited exploitability**: The bug requires:
     - A zoned storage device with mixed conventional and sequential zones
     - The ability to perform file pinning operations
     - The issue manifests as I/O errors or failed operations rather than memory corruption
  3. **Code analysis shows safe failure modes**:
     - The renamed function `f2fs_is_sequential_zone_area()` performs proper bounds checking
     - When pinning fails due to incorrect zone identification, it returns `-EAGAIN` safely
     - The code includes explicit error handling for zone mismatches
  4. **No memory safety issues**: Unlike the similar commits marked with CVE status that fixed null pointer dereferences or buffer overflows, this commit:
     - Doesn't fix any memory access violations
     - Doesn't fix any pointer arithmetic errors
     - Simply corrects zone type identification logic
  5. **Impact is denial of functionality, not security breach**: The worst case scenario is that file pinning operations would fail on certain zoned devices, which is a functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The fact that commit 9703d69d9d15 received a CVE doesn't automatically mean this fix warrants one - that commit introduced the file pinning feature itself, while this is a correctness fix for an edge case in zone identification.
aa1be8dd64163 f2fs: fix to detect gcing page in f2fs_is_cp_guaranteed()
- [sasha] This helps me understand the issue. The reference count is atomic and when it goes negative due to the mismatch between inc_page_count(F2FS_WB_DATA) and dec_page_count(F2FS_WB_CP_DATA), it causes f2fs_wait_on_all_pages to hang indefinitely because get_pages will never return 0.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: The issue is a reference counting bug that causes a kernel hang during unmount when specific conditions are met (encrypted + compressed files with garbage collection). While this does result in a denial of service (system hang), it requires:
     - Specific mount options (test_dummy_encryption, atgc)
     - Specific file system operations (creating compressed + encrypted files)
     - Triggering garbage collection at the right time
     - Attempting to unmount the filesystem
  2. **Limited Attack Surface**: This is not easily exploitable by an unprivileged attacker. It requires:
     - The ability to mount/unmount filesystems or convince an administrator to do so
     - Specific f2fs mount configurations that are not default
     - The ability to create and manipulate files in specific ways
  3. **Bug Type**: This is a logic error in reference counting between different page types (F2FS_WB_DATA vs F2FS_WB_CP_DATA) that only manifests under very specific conditions involving both encryption and compression with garbage collection.
  4. **Similar Pattern Analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (NO CVE): Also fixed gcing flag issues but was not assigned a CVE
     - Commits 2-5 (YES CVE): These fixed more serious issues like data corruption, memory safety violations (BUG_ON conditions), or broader impact scenarios
  The code change itself (`return page_private_gcing(fscrypt_pagecache_page(page));`) is a simple fix to ensure the correct page type is checked when dealing with encrypted bounce pages, preventing the reference count mismatch.
0c708e35cf264 f2fs: clean up w/ fscrypt_is_bounce_page()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This is purely a cleanup commit that replaces a manual check (`!mapping`) with a helper function (`fscrypt_is_bounce_page(page)`). Both achieve the same result - checking if `page->mapping == NULL`.
  2. **Functionally Equivalent Code**: Looking at the fscrypt_is_bounce_page() implementation:
     ```c
     static inline bool fscrypt_is_bounce_page(struct page *page)
     {
         return page->mapping == NULL;
     }
     ```
     The change from `if (!mapping)` to `if (fscrypt_is_bounce_page(page))` is semantically identical.
  3. **Code Cleanup Only**: The commit message explicitly states "Just cleanup, no logic changes." This is a refactoring that improves code readability by using a descriptive helper function instead of a raw pointer check.
  4. **No Bug Fix**: There's no mention of fixing any incorrect behavior, memory issues, security problems, or any other vulnerability. The function continues to work exactly as before.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) also show cleanup changes with no security implications, such as replacing macros, using helper functions, and code refactoring.
  This commit is a simple code maintenance change that makes the code more self-documenting by using a named function that clearly indicates what's being checked (whether it's a bounce page used by fscrypt) rather than a generic NULL check.
5c3bf6cba7911 bonding: assign random address if device address is same as bond
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit fixes a functional bug in the bonding driver's `fail_over_mac=follow` mode where duplicate MAC addresses could occur, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. The issue is purely a configuration/functionality problem that violates the expected behavior of the failover policy.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The bug only affects systems that:
     - Use the bonding driver
     - Specifically configure `fail_over_mac=follow` mode
     - Have a specific sequence of operations (enslaving, releasing, and re-enslaving interfaces)
     
  3. **No Exploitation Vector**: The duplicate MAC address situation:
     - Cannot be triggered remotely
     - Requires local administrative access to configure bonding
     - Does not lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service
     - Is more of a network configuration issue than a security issue
  4. **Performance/Functionality Issue**: As documented in the code, the "follow" mode exists specifically for "multiport devices that either become confused or incur a performance penalty when multiple ports are programmed with the same MAC address." The fix addresses this performance/functionality concern, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - "bonding: fix incorrect MAC address setting to receive NS messages" - NO CVE
     - "wifi: mac80211: fix change_address deadlock during unregister" - NO CVE  
     - "selftests: bonding: fix incorrect mac address" - NO CVE
     These are all MAC address handling fixes that were not assigned CVEs.
  The only similar commit that received a CVE was "bonding: restore bond's IFF_SLAVE flag if a non-eth dev enslave fails", which likely had different security implications related to improper flag handling that could affect system behavior more broadly.
e586e22974d2b iommu: Protect against overflow in iommu_pgsize()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the historical similar commits provided, I can now make a determination.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Integer Overflow Vulnerability**: The commit fixes an integer overflow in `iommu_pgsize()` where `offset + pgsize_next` can overflow on 32-bit systems, leading to incorrect page size calculations and memory corruption. The commit message explicitly states this causes "completely corrupts the mapping process."
  2. **Security Impact**: The overflow results in miscalculating the `count` parameter (should be 1 but becomes 2 in the example), which directly affects memory mapping operations. This can lead to:
     - Memory corruption during IOMMU mappings
     - Potential out-of-bounds memory access
     - Incorrect page table entries being created
  3. **Attack Vector**: The function is reachable through exported kernel APIs (`iommu_map()` is `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`), meaning device drivers and potentially unprivileged users through VFIO or other IOMMU-using subsystems can trigger this vulnerability.
  4. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The historical commits show that integer overflow fixes in page size calculations are assigned CVEs:
     - Similar Commit 3 & 4 (drm/xe overflow fix) received CVE status
     - Similar Commit 5 (iommufd ALIGN overflow) received CVE status
     
  5. **Exploitability**: The commit message provides a specific example of how to trigger the bug: calling `iommu_map(0, 0x40000000)` on 32-bit systems with AMD V1 page tables, showing this is not just theoretical.
  The fix properly uses `check_add_overflow()` to prevent the integer overflow, which is the standard kernel practice for preventing such vulnerabilities.
fa26198d30f3c iommu/io-pgtable-arm: dynamically allocate selftest device struct
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is fixing a compiler warning about stack frame size (1032 bytes exceeding 1024 byte limit) in a selftest function. This is purely a code quality/build issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Affects only selftest code**: The function `arm_lpae_do_selftests()` is only compiled when `CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE_SELFTEST` is enabled, which is a debug/test feature marked with `__init` (runs only at boot time during kernel initialization).
  3. **No security impact**: The change simply moves a `struct device` allocation from the stack to the heap using `faux_device_create()`. This doesn't fix any:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control issues
     - Information leaks
     - Privilege escalation
  4. **Similar to historical commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (selftests/bpf stack allocation) - NO CVE: Fixed stack alignment for ARM64 in test code
     - Commit 2 (mm stack gap) - NO CVE: Fixed minimum stack gap calculation issue
     - Commit 3 (dpaa on-stack arrays) - NO CVE: Replaced stack arrays with dynamic allocation
  The pattern shows that stack size/allocation fixes, especially in test code, are not considered security vulnerabilities requiring CVEs.
33647d0be323f iommu: ipmmu-vmsa: avoid Wformat-security warning
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a compile-time warning fix for `-Wformat-security`, not a runtime security vulnerability. The warning is about potential format string vulnerabilities when a non-literal string is used as a format string.
  2. **Limited security impact**: While passing `dev_name(&pdev->dev)` directly as a format string could theoretically be problematic if the device name contained format specifiers, in practice:
     - Device names in the kernel are typically controlled and don't contain user-supplied data
     - The IPMMU driver is for Renesas SoCs where device names come from device tree or platform data, not external untrusted sources
     - There's no evidence this could be exploited by an attacker
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - All are fixing `-Wformat-security` warnings
     - None were assigned CVEs
     - They're all preventive measures to satisfy compiler security warnings
  4. **Code change analysis**: The fix simply adds `"%s"` as the format string and passes the device name as an argument, which is the standard safe practice. This prevents any interpretation of format specifiers in the device name string.
  5. **No exploitable attack vector**: There's no clear path for an attacker to control the device name in a way that would make this exploitable. The device names come from trusted kernel sources (device tree, platform data).
  This is a good security practice fix to eliminate a theoretical vulnerability caught by compiler warnings, but it doesn't represent an actual exploitable security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
91dbac4076537 Use thread-safe function pointer in libbpf_print
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a thread-safety issue in the libbpf library's print function. The bug occurs because `libbpf_print()` atomically loads the print function pointer into a local variable `print_fn` but then incorrectly calls the global `__libbpf_pr` directly instead of using the thread-safe local copy.
  2. **Limited security impact**: 
     - This is a race condition in a logging/printing function, not in security-critical code paths
     - The worst-case scenario is calling the wrong print function or potentially a NULL pointer dereference if the global is changed between the check and the call
     - This affects only debug/informational output, not core BPF functionality
  3. **Not exploitable for privilege escalation**: 
     - The bug is in userspace library code (tools/lib/bpf/), not kernel code
     - It cannot lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure
     - At worst, it could cause incorrect logging output or a crash in the userspace application
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could crash bpftool when loading programs
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a security issue where packet pointers weren't properly invalidated
     - This commit is more like Similar Commit 2 (CVE: NO) - A formatting/printing fix with no security implications
  The bug is a programming error that affects correctness in multi-threaded environments but does not constitute a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
64821d25f05ac libbpf: Remove sample_period init in perf_buffer
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a **cleanup/clarification change** that removes dead code, not a security fix. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit removes the initialization of `sample_period` which was never actually used in the perf buffer functionality. The code shows that `wakeup_events` is what actually controls the buffer wakeup behavior, not `sample_period`.
  2. **Dead Code Removal**: Looking at the code change:
     - The original code set both `attr.sample_period = sample_period` and `attr.wakeup_events = sample_period` 
     - However, for `PERF_COUNT_SW_BPF_OUTPUT` events, only `wakeup_events` is meaningful
     - The removal of the `sample_period` assignment doesn't change any functional behavior
  3. **Documentation/Clarity Fix**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "avoid confusion" - it's removing misleading code that could confuse developers about how perf buffers work.
  4. **No Impact on System Security**: There's no mention of any security impact, no access control changes, no memory safety fixes, no privilege escalation prevention, or any other security-relevant modifications.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This commit is similar to the provided examples marked as "CVE Status: NO", which are performance optimizations and documentation fixes rather than security vulnerability fixes.
  The commit is simply cleaning up incorrect/misleading code initialization that had no functional impact, making it a maintenance change rather than a security fix.
bdd6d93d7a109 wifi: iwlwifi: re-add IWL_AMSDU_8K case
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my decision:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Non-exploitable bug**: The issue is that `IWL_AMSDU_8K` case was accidentally combined with `IWL_AMSDU_12K` case, causing both to return `get_order(16 * 1024)` instead of `IWL_AMSDU_8K` returning `get_order(8 * 1024)`.
  2. **Impact is functional, not security-related**: 
     - `get_order()` returns the allocation order for memory pages
     - For 8K, it should return order 1 (2 pages of 4K each)
     - For 16K, it returns order 2 (4 pages of 4K each)
     - This means when 8K buffer size is requested, the driver allocates 16K instead
  3. **Over-allocation, not under-allocation**: The bug causes the driver to allocate MORE memory than needed (16K instead of 8K), which wastes memory but doesn't create a buffer overflow or underflow vulnerability.
  4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The extra allocated memory doesn't lead to any security boundary violations, information disclosure, or privilege escalation opportunities.
  5. **Limited scope**: This only affects the receive buffer size calculation in the Intel WiFi driver, and the impact is purely performance/memory efficiency related.
  The fix is a simple correction to ensure proper memory allocation sizes, but the original bug doesn't create any exploitable security vulnerability.
4dde20b1aa85d libbpf: Fix event name too long error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the related code, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug in libbpf (a userspace library) that causes legacy kprobe/uprobe attachment to fail with -EINVAL when event names exceed 64 bytes. The kernel properly validates and rejects the too-long event names, returning an error code.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue results in:
     - Feature failure (inability to attach probes with long names)
     - Proper error handling by the kernel (-EINVAL return)
     - No memory corruption, buffer overflow, or privilege escalation
     - No bypass of security mechanisms
  3. **Userspace library issue**: The bug is in libbpf's event name generation logic, not in the kernel's security enforcement. The kernel's MAX_EVENT_NAME_LEN validation (64 bytes) works correctly and prevents the issue.
  4. **The fix**: The commit reorders the event name format from:
     - Old: `libbpf_<pid>_<name>_0x<offset>` 
     - New: `libbpf_<pid>_<unique_id>_<name>_0x<offset>`
     
     This ensures the unique ID is preserved even if the name gets truncated to fit within the 64-byte limit.
  5. **Similar commits reference**: Looking at the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO", we see commits that fix test assertions, field population issues, and error messages - all functional fixes without security implications.
  The commit fixes a usability/functionality issue where certain probe attachments would fail, but there's no exploitation potential or security boundary violation involved.
e4d953ca557e0 scsi: hisi_sas: Call I_T_nexus after soft reset for SATA disk
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While the original behavior could cause SATA disks to become permanently inaccessible (requiring manual recovery), this is a reliability/functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability. The issue:
  1. Requires physical access or specific hardware configurations to trigger
  2. Was a deliberate design choice to handle faulty disks (not a security flaw)
  3. Doesn't enable privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized access
  4. Only causes local denial of service requiring admin intervention to recover
  The fix removes an overly aggressive error handling mechanism that would disable PHYs permanently when SATA soft resets failed, improving system reliability but not addressing a security vulnerability.
2b11d33de2326 RDMA/hns: Include hnae3.h in hns_roce_hw_v2.h
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information:
  **NO**
  This commit is a build/compilation fix that addresses a missing header file inclusion. The commit fixes a dependency issue where `hns_roce_hw_v2.h` uses structures/functions from `hnae3.h` (specifically in the inline function `hns_roce_write64()`) but doesn't include the header directly.
  Key points:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is purely a code organization/compilation issue
  2. **No runtime impact**: The code was already working correctly when files happened to include both headers
  3. **Header dependency fix**: The change simply moves the `#include "hnae3.h"` statement from individual .c files into the header file that actually needs it
  4. **No functional changes**: The actual code logic remains unchanged - it's just reorganizing where headers are included
  Looking at the historical CVE assignments in the similar commits:
  - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" involved actual security issues like deadlocks or race conditions
  - Commits marked "CVE Status: NO" were typically build fixes, cleanups, or non-security bug fixes
  This commit falls into the same category as other non-CVE commits - it's a build/compilation fix that improves code organization but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
1c7eec4d5f3b3 RDMA/rxe: Fix "trying to register non-static key in rxe_qp_do_cleanup" bug
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment.
  Let me examine the issue:
  1. **Bug Description**: The commit fixes a "trying to register non-static key" bug that occurs during cleanup when timers haven't been properly initialized.
  2. **Root Cause**: In `rxe_create_qp()`, if `rxe_qp_from_init()` fails before timers are initialized in `rxe_qp_init_req()`, the cleanup path tries to delete uninitialized timers.
  3. **Code Changes**: The fix adds a check to verify if timers are initialized before attempting to delete them:
  ```c
  +	/* In the function timer_setup, .function is initialized. If .function
  +	 * is NULL, it indicates the function timer_setup is not called, the
  +	 * timer is not initialized. Or else, the timer is initialized.
  +	 */
  +	if (qp_type(qp) == IB_QPT_RC && qp->retrans_timer.function &&
  +		qp->rnr_nak_timer.function) {
   		timer_delete_sync(&qp->retrans_timer);
   		timer_delete_sync(&qp->rnr_nak_timer);
   	}
  ```
  4. **Security Impact Analysis**:
     - This is a lockdep warning about trying to register a non-static key
     - The issue occurs in an error/cleanup path during QP creation failure
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - No remote exploitation vector
     - The impact is limited to a kernel warning/debugging message
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involve:
       - Memory leaks leading to resource exhaustion
       - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
       - Race conditions with potential memory corruption
     - This commit only fixes an improper cleanup sequence with no security impact
  **Decision: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a bug in the cleanup path, it does not represent a security vulnerability. The issue is purely a programming error that triggers a lockdep warning when uninitialized timers are accessed during cleanup. There is no exploitable security impact such as memory corruption, information disclosure, or denial of service beyond a kernel warning message. This is a quality/correctness fix rather than a security fix.
823435bd23108 wifi: ath12k: fix node corruption in ar->arvifs list
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
e9e094a9734ea wifi: ath12k: Prevent sending WMI commands to firmware during firmware crash
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, let me provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a reliability/stability fix rather than a security vulnerability. The commit prevents WMI commands from being sent to firmware during recovery, which causes kernel call traces and warnings. The primary impact is system instability and warning messages, not a security compromise.
  2. **Call trace analysis**: The kernel trace shown is a lockdep warning about lock class registration, not a security-related crash. It's triggered by the driver trying to send WMI commands while firmware is recovering, leading to a benign warning about spinlock usage.
  3. **Limited security impact**: 
     - The issue doesn't allow privilege escalation
     - No memory corruption is demonstrated
     - No information disclosure occurs
     - The impact is limited to DoS through warning messages
  4. **Code changes**: The fix simply sets two flags (`ATH12K_FLAG_CRASH_FLUSH` and `ATH12K_FLAG_RECOVERY`) earlier in the MHI callback when firmware crash is detected. This is a timing optimization to prevent unnecessary WMI command attempts, not a security boundary fix.
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE assigned): Fixed actual memory corruption through incorrect DMA memory management
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE assigned): Fixed memory corruption through incorrect size calculations
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE assigned): Fixed NULL pointer dereference causing kernel crashes
     - This commit: Only prevents benign warning messages during recovery
  The issue is more about operational correctness than security. While sending commands to crashed firmware could theoretically be problematic, the actual impact shown is just warning messages and failed operations that are already handled by the recovery mechanism.
f5d6b15d95032 wifi: ath12k: fix wrong handling of CCMP256 and GCMP ciphers
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
bd00cc7e8a4c1 wifi: ath12k: replace the usage of rx desc with rx_info
- [sasha] Let me analyze the code changes provided in the commit. Based on the commit message and the code diff:
  **Key observations:**
  1. **Problem being fixed**: The commit states that "during the undecap to native wifi mode, the rx descriptor memory is overwritten" and "any subsequent accesses to rx descriptor related memory yield invalid values."
  2. **Solution**: The fix replaces direct accesses to rx_desc with pre-cached information in rx_info structure to prevent accessing overwritten/invalid memory.
  3. **Security implications**: 
     - The issue involves **invalid memory access** after rx descriptor memory is overwritten
     - This could potentially lead to reading garbage values or accessing freed/reallocated memory
     - However, the commit doesn't explicitly mention crashes, memory corruption beyond the descriptor, or exploitable conditions
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 & 2 (CVE Status: YES) explicitly mention "memory corruption" and add bounds checking to prevent buffer overflows
     - Similar Commit 3 & 4 (CVE Status: NO) are about memory leaks and buffer size adjustments, not security vulnerabilities
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE Status: NO) is about fixing frequency calculations, not a security issue
  5. **Nature of the fix**: This appears to be a **use-after-free** or **use-of-invalid-memory** issue where the code was accessing memory that had been overwritten by another operation. The fix ensures valid cached data is used instead.
  **NO**
  While this commit fixes an invalid memory access issue, it does not appear to meet the threshold for a CVE assignment. The issue is limited to reading invalid values from overwritten rx descriptor memory within the driver's own data structures, rather than a broader memory corruption or exploitable vulnerability. The fix is essentially a refactoring to use cached values instead of re-reading potentially overwritten descriptor memory. There's no indication of potential for privilege escalation, denial of service, or information disclosure beyond the driver's internal state.
e88e6e3c9ada8 wifi: ath12k: add rx_info to capture required field from rx descriptor
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is adding infrastructure to pre-cache RX descriptor fields before they get overwritten during packet processing. While the commit mentions "invalid data access" could occur, this appears to be about accessing stale/invalid descriptor data after it has been legitimately overwritten during normal packet processing, not about preventing unauthorized memory access or corruption.
  2. **Preparatory/infrastructure change**: The commit explicitly states "This rx_info structure will be used in the next patch" - indicating this is preparatory work for future changes rather than fixing an existing security issue.
  3. **No exploitation scenario**: Unlike the similar commits marked as CVE-worthy which explicitly mention:
     - "potentially resulting in invalid data access and memory corruption" (Similar Commit 1)
     - Buffer overflow scenarios with packets exceeding maximum header length
     - Sanity checks to prevent invalid memory access
     This commit is simply reorganizing when data is read from descriptors to avoid reading them after they've been overwritten by the normal processing flow.
  4. **Normal driver operation**: The "overwriting" mentioned appears to be part of the normal RX processing flow where the descriptor memory gets reused/modified during undecap operations, not an error condition or vulnerability.
  5. **No bounds checking or validation**: The commit doesn't add any security-relevant checks or validations - it's purely moving when certain fields are read and stored.
  The key difference from the CVE-worthy commits is that those were fixing actual vulnerabilities where malformed packets could cause buffer overflows or invalid memory access, while this commit is addressing a design issue where descriptor data needs to be cached before it's legitimately modified during normal processing.
5393dcb452091 wifi: ath12k: change the status update in the monitor Rx
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional Fix, Not Security Fix**: While the commit does fix reading from incorrect memory locations, this appears to be a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The driver was attempting to read RX TLV headers that don't exist in ath12k hardware, causing incorrect status information to be filled.
  2. **Limited Security Impact**: 
     - The code is reading from within already-allocated SKB (socket buffer) data structures, not arbitrary kernel memory
     - The `tail_rx_desc` pointer comes from `tail_msdu->data`, which is controlled buffer data
     - The incorrect reads would result in garbage/incorrect status values rather than exposing sensitive kernel memory
  3. **Monitor Mode Context**: This only affects monitor mode packet reception, which requires privileged access to enable. Users who can enable monitor mode already have significant network access privileges.
  4. **No Memory Safety Violation**: Unlike the similar commits marked with CVE status YES (which had actual memory leaks via kzalloc without corresponding kfree), this commit doesn't introduce or fix any memory allocation issues.
  5. **Pattern Analysis**: Comparing to the similar commits provided:
     - CVE YES commits fixed actual memory leaks (unfreed allocations)  
     - CVE NO commits fixed functional issues (incorrect frequency calculations, wrong struct definitions)
     - This commit aligns more with the CVE NO pattern - fixing incorrect data interpretation
  The commit is fixing a functional bug where the driver was reading status information from the wrong location (expecting TLV headers that don't exist in ath12k hardware), not a security vulnerability with exploitable consequences.
6a88093f79ea0 wifi: ath12k: Replace band define G with GHZ where appropriate
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a cosmetic/naming change that replaces "G" with "GHZ" in band-related defines and enums for clarity. The commit message explicitly states "No functional changes. Only compile tested."
  2. **Code analysis shows only naming changes**:
     - `WMI_HOST_WLAN_2G_CAP` → `WMI_HOST_WLAN_2GHZ_CAP`
     - `WMI_HOST_WLAN_5G_CAP` → `WMI_HOST_WLAN_5GHZ_CAP`
     - `ATH12K_MIN_5G_FREQ` → `ATH12K_MIN_5GHZ_FREQ`
     - `ATH12K_MIN_6G_FREQ` → `ATH12K_MIN_6GHZ_FREQ`
     - etc.
  3. **No security implications**: The changes are purely renaming constants and variables for better clarity. There are no:
     - Buffer overflow fixes
     - Memory management changes
     - Access control modifications
     - Input validation improvements
     - Race condition fixes
     - Any actual logic changes
  4. **Similar to the reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO", they all fix actual functional issues (incorrect frequency calculations, wrong flag usage, etc.) yet were still not assigned CVEs. This commit does even less - it only renames variables.
  5. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The commit doesn't address any security vulnerability. It's a code cleanup/refactoring change to improve code readability by using more appropriate naming conventions ("GHz" instead of just "G" for frequency bands).
a6621bf6397ae wifi: ath12k: Avoid fetch Error bitmap and decap format from Rx TLV
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit is an architectural refactoring to support new 802.11be hardware, not a security fix. The changes move where error bitmap and decap format information are fetched from - instead of extracting them from RX descriptors in MSDU data, they are now retrieved from the `mon_mpdu` structure which stores information parsed from the MSDU END TLV tag.
  Key reasons this is not a security vulnerability fix:
  1. The commit message clearly states this is to handle different TLV layouts between hardware versions, not to fix a security issue
  2. No memory corruption, buffer overflow, or access control issues are being addressed
  3. The changes are purely architectural - moving where data is stored/retrieved, not fixing incorrect handling
  4. There's no indication of exploitable behavior being fixed
  5. The error checking logic remains the same, just the source of the data changes
  This is a forward compatibility change for 802.11be hardware support where Qualcomm changed the TLV data layout in their newer chips.
3973cda5ef496 wifi: ath12k: Add extra TLV tag parsing support in monitor Rx path
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is adding new functionality to support monitor mode in ath12k for 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) hardware, not fixing an existing security vulnerability. 
  Key evidence:
  1. The commit message clearly states it's "Adding extra TLV tag parsing support" for hardware that "does not report the Rx TLV header in the MSDU data" - this is describing a hardware difference, not a bug fix
  2. The monitor mode functionality is being added as new code - the `ath12k_dp_mon_parse_rx_dest_tlv` function is entirely new
  3. The memory allocation (`kzalloc`) in `HAL_RX_MPDU_START` case is part of the new implementation, not fixing a leak in existing code
  4. The WARN_ON_ONCE check is defensive programming for the new code path, not patching an existing vulnerability
  Unlike the similar CVE commits shown which explicitly state "Fix memory leak" or "Avoid memory leak", this commit is implementing monitor mode support that wasn't previously present in ath12k. The patterns that might appear similar (like memory management) are simply part of implementing the feature correctly from the start, not correcting flaws in existing code.

20d3c19bd8f9b wifi: rtw88: do not ignore hardware read error during DPK
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change adds proper error handling for a hardware readiness check during DPK (Digital Pre-distortion Calibration), which is a performance optimization technique for wireless transmitters. The code change only adds a warning message when `check_hw_ready()` fails, changing from:
  ```c
  check_hw_ready(rtwdev, 0x2d9c, MASKBYTE0, 0x55);
  ```
  to:
  ```c
  if (!check_hw_ready(rtwdev, 0x2d9c, MASKBYTE0, 0x55))
      rtw_warn(rtwdev, "DPK stuck, performance may be suboptimal");
  ```
  This is a code quality improvement that addresses a static analysis finding (SVACE) about an ignored return value. The impact is limited to potential suboptimal wireless performance if DPK calibration fails - there are no security implications such as privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.

  - If `queue <= RTW_TX_QUEUE_VO` (i.e., queues 0-3: BK, BE, VI, VO), it calls `rtw_sdio_indicate_tx_status`
  - Otherwise (queues 4-7: BCN, MGMT, HI0, H2C), it simply frees the skb without reporting status
  This is particularly problematic for the MGMT queue (value 5) which handles management frames crucial for AP mode operation.
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  While this is an important bug fix that prevents AP mode from functioning correctly, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The bug causes a functional failure (AP mode doesn't work) rather than allowing unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  2. **No exploitation path**: An attacker cannot exploit this bug to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges. The worst outcome is denial of service through non-functional AP mode.
  3. **Limited impact**: The bug only affects devices using rtw88 SDIO chipsets in AP mode. It doesn't affect client mode operation or other rtw88 variants (PCI, USB).
  4. **Functionality bug, not security vulnerability**: The missing TX status reports prevent proper frame acknowledgment and management, but don't create an exploitable security weakness. The driver simply doesn't work correctly in AP mode.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they are also functional fixes without CVE assignments despite affecting wireless operations.
  The commit message accurately describes this as fixing "rtw88-sdio do not work in AP mode" rather than fixing a security vulnerability.
b2effcdc23797 wifi: rtw88: sdio: map mgmt frames to queue TX_DESC_QSEL_MGMT
- [sasha] Let me understand the changes better from the commit information provided:
  **Commit Analysis:**
  1. **Type of Change:** The commit modifies how management frames are mapped to TX queues in the rtw88 SDIO driver.
  2. **What was changed:**
     - Removed conditional logic that mapped management frames to `TX_DESC_QSEL_HIGH` for 11n chipsets
     - Now all management frames consistently map to `TX_DESC_QSEL_MGMT`
  3. **Impact:** The commit fixes AP mode functionality by enabling TX status reports for management frames.
  4. **Security Assessment:**
     - This is a functional fix that addresses a feature not working (AP mode)
     - The issue is that management frames weren't getting TX status reports, which prevented AP mode from functioning properly
     - There is no indication of:
       - Memory corruption
       - Privilege escalation
       - Information disclosure
       - Remote code execution
       - Access control bypass
       - Any other security vulnerability
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits:**
     - Similar Commit 1: Fixed channel and TX power settings for MLO - No CVE (functional improvement)
     - Similar Commit 2: Fixed loopback packet TX queue handling - No CVE (functional fix)
     - Similar Commit 3: Fixed TX/RX calibration issues - No CVE (functional fix)
     - Similar Commit 4: Fixed racing condition affecting TX - No CVE (functional fix)
     - Similar Commit 5: Fixed MPDU counting logic - No CVE (functional fix)
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. It's a functional fix that enables AP mode to work correctly by ensuring management frames get proper TX status reports. The issue prevented a feature from working but did not introduce any security vulnerability. The change simply corrects the queue mapping for management frames to ensure they generate TX reports, which is necessary for AP mode operation. This is similar to the other commits shown which were all functional fixes without security implications.
d2fddbd347992 bonding: Fix multiple long standing offload races
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes, as well as exploration of the kernel tree:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Memory Safety Vulnerabilities**: The commit fixes multiple race conditions that lead to serious memory safety issues:
     - **Double-free vulnerability**: `xdo_dev_state_delete()` could be called twice on the same xfrm state
     - **Use-after-free**: States could be accessed after being freed through concurrent operations
     - **Wrong device operations**: `xdo_dev_state_free()` could be called on the wrong device
  2. **Security Impact**: The code changes show fixes for:
     - Protection added with `spin_lock_bh(&ipsec->xs->lock)` to prevent concurrent access
     - Check for `XFRM_STATE_DEAD` to avoid double deletion
     - Proper synchronization of `xso.real_dev` pointer access
  3. **Exploitability**: These vulnerabilities could be exploited by:
     - A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges
     - Triggering race conditions between IPsec state operations and bond slave changes
     - Potentially leading to kernel memory corruption and privilege escalation
  4. **Similar Commit Pattern**: The historical commits show that:
     - Commit 95c90e4ad89d (CVE assigned) fixed a null pointer dereference
     - Commit f8cde9805981 (CVE assigned) fixed an xfrm real_dev null pointer dereference
     - This commit fixes even more severe issues (double-free, use-after-free)
  The commit explicitly states it fixes "long standing offload races" and the code changes demonstrate clear memory safety fixes that go beyond functional bugs, making this a security vulnerability worthy of CVE assignment.
fd4e41ebf66cb bonding: Mark active offloaded xfrm_states
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the complete situation and the code changes in the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit fixes functional bugs related to xfrm state management in bonding, not security vulnerabilities. The issues being fixed are:
     - A warning/stack trace when removing IPsec rules that are no longer offloaded
     - A theoretical double-free issue when calling bond_ipsec_del_sa_all() multiple times
  2. **The stack trace is not exploitable**: The mlx5e driver warning (WARN_ON) shown in the commit message occurs because the driver is asked to remove a rule that's no longer offloaded. This causes a warning but not a security issue - it's defensive programming detecting an inconsistent state.
  3. **State tracking issue**: The core problem is that the code lost track of which xfrm states were actively offloaded after certain link state changes. When all bond links go down and come back up, the states aren't properly re-offloaded, leading to inconsistency.
  4. **The fix is proper state management**: The commit properly manages the xs->xso.real_dev pointer to track which device currently holds the offloaded rule, setting it after successful add operations and clearing it before delete operations.
  5. **No memory corruption or privilege escalation**: Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences that could crash the system, this commit prevents warnings and ensures proper cleanup - it's a functionality/reliability fix rather than a security fix.
  The similar commits that received CVEs (commits 3 and 4) fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences where curr_active was accessed without checking if it was NULL first, which could cause kernel crashes. This commit is different - it fixes state tracking issues that lead to warnings and potential resource leaks, but not exploitable security vulnerabilities.
43eca05b6a3b9 xfrm: Add explicit dev to .xdo_dev_state_{add,delete,free}
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the similar commits for context:
  Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security fix**: This is a refactoring/improvement commit that adds explicit device pointers to IPsec offload callbacks. The commit message clearly states it's about eliminating confusion between two categories of device driver implementations and enabling better bonding support.
  2. **No vulnerability being fixed**: Unlike the similar commits with CVE status YES (which fixed null pointer dereferences causing kernel crashes), this commit:
     - Does not fix any crash, memory corruption, or security vulnerability
     - Does not address any race condition or unsafe memory access
     - Simply adds an explicit `dev` parameter to callback functions to clarify which device should be used
  3. **Code changes are architectural**: The changes involve:
     - Adding a `struct net_device *dev` parameter to xdo_dev_state_add/delete/free callbacks
     - Updating all driver implementations to use the passed device instead of xs->xso.dev or xs->xso.real_dev
     - Making xso.real_dev a private pointer for bonding driver use only
  4. **Contrast with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" fixed actual security issues:
     - Null pointer dereferences causing kernel crashes (BUG: unable to handle page fault)
     - Race conditions where packets in transit could trigger crashes
     - Both had clear crash traces in their commit messages
  This commit is a clean architectural improvement to support bonding properly, not a security vulnerability fix.
25ac138f58e7d xfrm: Use xdo.dev instead of xdo.real_dev
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Code simplification, not a bug fix**: The commit message clearly states this is a simplification - "real_dev was copied from dev, but it was never set to anything else". The code analysis confirms that `xdo->real_dev` was always set to the same value as `xdo->dev` in `xfrm_dev_policy_add()`.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The changes are purely cosmetic - removing a redundant field that was always set to the same value as another field. There's no:
     - Buffer overflow fix
     - Access control issue
     - Memory corruption fix
     - Information leak fix
     - Race condition fix
  3. **No functional change**: The commit only removes dead code. For policies (not states), `real_dev` was never used differently from `dev`. The only place where `real_dev` differs from `dev` is in the bonding driver for states (not policies), and this commit doesn't affect that functionality.
  4. **Similar to refactoring commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (renaming xfrm_state_offload, adding direction field, etc.), these are all structural improvements without security implications, and none were assigned CVEs.
  The commit is a cleanup that removes unnecessary code duplication for policy offload structures, with no security impact.
d79444e8c3d40 net/mlx5: Avoid using xso.real_dev unnecessarily
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it is part of a series that fixes race conditions and potential crashes in the bonding/IPsec subsystem, this specific commit (d79444e8c3d4) is a defensive refactoring that:
  1. **Does not fix a vulnerability itself** - It merely reduces the usage of `xso.real_dev` to make the code safer and more maintainable. The commit message explicitly states it "switches mlx5e_ipsec_init_macs() and mlx5e_ipsec_netevent_event() to make use of it [the saved device]."
  2. **Is preparatory in nature** - This is patch 1/6 in a series, and it sets up the groundwork for the actual fixes that come in later patches (especially patches 5 and 6 which fix the race conditions).
  3. **Does not change security boundaries** - The code changes show it's simply saving a device reference (`sa_entry->dev = netdev`) and using that instead of `xso.real_dev`. The functionality remains the same.
  4. **Similar to commit 2** - Like the bonding commit that wasn't assigned a CVE, this is implementing proper resource management and cleanup patterns rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
  The actual security fixes appear to be in the later patches of the series (d2fddbd34799 "bonding: Fix multiple long standing offload races" would be a better candidate for CVE consideration as it fixes actual race conditions and null pointer dereferences).
ee684de5c1b0a libbpf: Fix buffer overflow in bpf_object__init_prog
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a heap buffer overflow vulnerability that allows reading arbitrary memory through a corrupted BPF ELF file. The overflow happens when `sec_off + prog_sz` wraps around due to integer overflow.
  2. **Attack Vector**: An attacker can craft a malicious BPF ELF file with a symbol offset set to a large value (e.g., `ffffffffffffffb8`) that causes `data + sec_off` to point before the allocated buffer, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
  3. **Real Impact**: The vulnerability causes a heap buffer overflow as confirmed by AddressSanitizer, where memcpy at line 856 in `bpf_object__init_prog` reads from memory outside the allocated bounds.
  4. **Exploitability**: The commit message includes a proof-of-concept reproducer and shows that arbitrary BPF instructions can be loaded by libbpf through this vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This is similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the examples that fix buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences that could be triggered by malformed input files.
  The fix adds an overflow check `|| sec_off + prog_sz < sec_off` to detect when the addition wraps around, preventing the out-of-bounds access.
e8a1bd8344054 net: ncsi: Fix GCPS 64-bit member variables
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a data type correction fix that changes 32-bit variables to 64-bit variables to properly handle NCSI (Network Controller Sideband Interface) statistics according to the DSP0222 v1.0.0 specification.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The code changes show:
     - Converting `u32` to `u64` for byte counters and packet counters in `struct ncsi_channel_stats`
     - Converting `__be32` to `__be64` in the response packet structures
     - Updating the parsing code from `ntohl()` to `be64_to_cpu()`
  3. **No user impact**: The commit message explicitly states "The Driver currently collects these stats, but they are yet to be exposed to the user. Therefore, no user impact." This means:
     - The statistics are only collected internally
     - There's no user-facing interface to read these statistics
     - No privilege escalation or information disclosure vulnerability
  4. **Type of issue**: This is a correctness issue where statistics could wrap around at 32-bit boundaries instead of 64-bit boundaries. While this could lead to incorrect statistics internally, it doesn't create any security vulnerability such as:
     - Memory corruption
     - Buffer overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information leak
     - Denial of service
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, statistics-related fixes that don't expose security vulnerabilities are not assigned CVEs (e.g., "Fix RX statistics for XDP_TX", "Fix truncation of offloaded action statistics").
  The changes are purely about fixing the data type width to match the specification, with no security implications.
1938be9fbad1b pinctrl: qcom: tlmm-test: Fix potential null dereference in tlmm kunit test
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Test code, not production code**: The fix is in `drivers/pinctrl/qcom/tlmm-test.c`, which is a KUnit test file for testing TLMM interrupt handling. This is test infrastructure code that:
     - Only runs when explicitly enabled with CONFIG_PINCTRL_TLMM_TEST
     - Requires a module parameter (`tlmm-test.gpio`) to be set to function
     - Is designed for validation and testing purposes only
  2. **Limited impact**: The null pointer dereference can only occur in the `tlmm_test_init()` function during test initialization. The commit shows adding `KUNIT_ASSERT_NOT_ERR_OR_NULL(test, priv);` after the `kunit_kzalloc()` call. This prevents a potential crash during test setup, but:
     - It cannot be exploited by unprivileged users
     - It requires specific test execution with root privileges
     - It's not part of normal system operation
  3. **Pattern comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 1 (ext4 kunit test) - CVE Status: NO - Also a test code fix
     - Similar Commits 2 & 5 (kunit device driver test) - CVE Status: YES - But these were in the core kunit infrastructure that could affect multiple tests
     - Similar Commits 3 & 4 (QCOM LPASS) - CVE Status: YES - These were in production driver code, not test code
  The key distinction is that this fix is in optional test code that requires manual intervention to run, unlike the CVE-assigned commits which affected production drivers or core testing infrastructure. This aligns with the pattern where test-specific fixes typically don't receive CVEs unless they're in core testing infrastructure.
36ef2575e78d1 net/mlx5: HWS, Fix matcher action template attach
- [sasha] Now let me look at the key changes in the commit. Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit fixes memory corruption issues in the BWC (Backward Compatible) matcher layer, specifically:
     - Fixed-size array overrun in `bwc_matcher->at` array (was hardcoded to `MLX5HWS_BWC_MATCHER_ATTACH_AT_NUM`)
     - Similar issue in the native matcher's `at` array
  2. **Not a security vulnerability** because:
     - This is in the mlx5 network driver's hardware steering subsystem, which handles network packet flow rules
     - The buffer overrun occurs in kernel-controlled data structures during action template attachment
     - There's no path for userspace to directly trigger this overflow with malicious input
     - The overflow would only occur when attaching more than 8 action templates, which is a driver-internal operation
  3. **Impact analysis**:
     - The bug could cause memory corruption and potentially crash the system
     - However, it requires specific driver operations (attaching many action templates) that are not directly controllable by unprivileged users
     - This is more of a reliability/stability issue rather than a security vulnerability
  4. **Key code changes**:
     - Changed from fixed-size array `at[MLX5HWS_BWC_MATCHER_ATTACH_AT_NUM]` to dynamically allocated `**at`
     - Added proper bounds checking and dynamic reallocation with `krealloc()`
     - Added `need_rehash` parameter to properly handle error conditions
  The similar commits show that memory leaks and use-after-free issues in this subsystem have been assigned CVEs (commits 3 and 4), but those involved different security implications - particularly use-after-free conditions that could be more easily exploited. This commit fixes a more constrained issue that would be difficult to exploit for security purposes.
ee62ce7a1d909 page_pool: Track DMA-mapped pages and unmap them when destroying the pool
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Bug Nature**: This is primarily a resource leak and system stability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The commit fixes improper cleanup of DMA mappings when page_pool is destroyed, which can lead to:
     - Resource leaks (DMA mappings not being freed)
     - Potential crashes when attempting to unmap through a non-existent DMA device
     - System instability during device teardown
  2. **No Direct Security Impact**: The code changes show:
     - Implementation of tracking for DMA-mapped pages using xarray
     - Proper cleanup of DMA mappings during pool destruction
     - Synchronization improvements to prevent race conditions
     
     There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption that could be exploited
     - Privilege escalation possibilities
     - Information disclosure vulnerabilities
     - Remote exploitation vectors
  3. **Limited Scope**: The issue only manifests during specific conditions:
     - Device teardown while DMA-mapped pages are outstanding
     - Requires specific hardware/driver configurations using page_pool with DMA mapping
     - Impact is primarily denial of service (crash) rather than exploitable security vulnerability
  4. **Similar Commits Analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fixed issues with clear security implications (e.g., invalid wait context leading to potential race conditions)
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: NO" fixed functional bugs without security impact
     - This commit aligns more with the "NO" category as it fixes a functional bug (resource leak) rather than a security vulnerability
  5. **Fix Implementation**: The fix adds proper tracking and cleanup mechanisms but doesn't address any security boundary violations or exploitable conditions. It's a correctness fix to ensure proper resource management.
  While the bug could cause system crashes in certain scenarios, it doesn't meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it lacks exploitable security implications beyond potential denial of service through normal device operations.
cd3c93167da0e page_pool: Move pp_magic check into helper functions
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit changes:
  1. **Nature of the changes**: This commit is a pure refactoring that moves the pp_magic check logic into helper functions (`page_pool_page_is_pp()` and `netmem_is_pp()`). 
  2. **Security implications**: 
     - The commit does NOT fix any security vulnerability
     - It does NOT change the logic of how pp_magic is checked
     - It simply abstracts the check `(page->pp_magic & ~0x3UL) == PP_SIGNATURE` into helper functions
     - The comment mentions "we are about to stash some more information into the pp_magic field" but this commit itself doesn't add that functionality
  3. **Code pattern analysis**:
     - The original code: `((page->pp_magic & ~0x3UL) == PP_SIGNATURE)`
     - The new code: `page_pool_page_is_pp(page)` which internally does the same check
     - All changes maintain the exact same logic
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", they all share characteristics of being:
     - Code cleanup/refactoring
     - Build fixes
     - Configuration changes
     - Function parameter removals that don't affect security
  **NO**
  This commit is a pure refactoring change that introduces helper functions to encapsulate the page pool magic signature check. It does not fix any security vulnerability, introduce any behavioral changes, or modify the underlying logic. The commit merely moves an existing check pattern into reusable helper functions for better code maintainability. This is a typical code cleanup that improves readability without any security implications.
c26c192c3d486 udp: properly deal with xfrm encap and ADDRFORM
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Security-relevant crash/DoS**: The commit fixes a WARNING/splat that occurs in the kernel networking stack. The stacktrace shows this happens during socket cleanup (`udpv6_destroy_sock`) and can be triggered by userspace operations, as evidenced by the syzkaller reproducer.
  2. **Race condition with security implications**: The commit explicitly mentions "set_xfrm_gro_udp_encap_rcv() is prone to races with IPV6_ADDRFORM". Race conditions in kernel networking code often have security implications.
  3. **Incorrect assumptions leading to crashes**: The code assumed "that the GRO receive callback is always set when the UDP tunnel is enabled, but syzkaller proved otherwise". This incorrect assumption leads to a kernel warning/crash path.
  4. **Impact on production systems**: The warning/crash occurs in UDP tunnel handling code which is commonly used in VPN and overlay network configurations (XFRM/IPsec ESP-in-UDP encapsulation).
  5. **Fixes fundamental issues**: The commit fixes two separate bugs:
     - Missing synchronization when setting GRO callbacks (race condition)
     - Incorrect location of GRO accounting hooks
  6. **Similar to previous CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, the commit fixing "udp: skip L4 aggregation for UDP tunnel packets" was assigned a CVE, and this commit addresses a similarly critical issue in the UDP tunnel/GRO subsystem.
  The security impact is a denial of service through triggering kernel warnings/crashes via crafted socket operations, particularly when using UDP tunnels with XFRM encapsulation.
5d7f5b2f6b935 udp_tunnel: use static call for GRO hooks when possible
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit changes more carefully. Based on the commit message and code changes:
  ## Analysis
  **Commit Summary**: This commit optimizes UDP tunnel GRO (Generic Receive Offload) processing by replacing indirect function calls with static calls when there's only a single UDP tunnel type active in the system.
  **Key Changes**:
  1. Adds infrastructure to track registered UDP tunnel types
  2. Replaces indirect calls (`call_gro_receive_sk`) with static calls when only one tunnel type is active
  3. Adds `udp_tunnel_update_gro_rcv()` function to manage tunnel type registration
  4. Implements a dummy GRO callback to avoid NULL pointers
  **Security Analysis**:
  Comparing with the historical examples:
  - **Similar Commit 2 & 3 (CVE: YES)**: Fixed actual security vulnerabilities where UDP packets could be improperly GROed, leading to data corruption, kernel crashes, or packet mishandling.
  - **Similar Commit 1 & 4 (CVE: NO)**: Fixed functional issues or made performance improvements without security implications.
  This commit is a **performance optimization** that:
  - Does NOT fix any security vulnerability
  - Does NOT change the security model or access controls
  - Does NOT fix memory corruption, buffer overflows, or information leaks
  - Does NOT address any packet handling correctness issues
  - Simply optimizes the calling mechanism from indirect to static calls
  The commit explicitly states it's for performance ("replace the indirect call... with a static call") and includes proper bounds checking (`UDP_MAX_TUNNEL_TYPES`) to prevent overflows.
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because it is purely a performance optimization that replaces indirect function calls with static calls. It does not fix any security vulnerability, memory corruption issue, or packet handling bug. The change maintains the same functional behavior while improving performance when a single UDP tunnel type is active.
a36283e2b683f udp_tunnel: create a fastpath GRO lookup.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Reasoning:
  1. **Performance optimization, not a security fix**: This commit introduces a fastpath optimization for UDP tunnel GRO lookups. It's designed to improve performance by caching a direct reference to a single UDP tunnel socket when only one exists in a namespace.
  2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: Unlike the similar commits marked with CVE status YES (which fixed packet corruption, inner stream corruption, and potential crashes), this commit doesn't fix any security issues. It's adding new functionality for optimization purposes.
  3. **Proper security measures in place**: The code includes appropriate safeguards:
     - Restricts to kernel sockets only (`sk->sk_kern_sock` check)
     - Uses proper locking (spinlock) for concurrent access
     - Uses RCU for safe read access
     - No privilege escalation or access control bypass potential
  4. **Revert was for quality, not security**: While the commit was later reverted due to "multiple small issues," the revert message doesn't indicate any security concerns. The issues appear to be related to code quality or functional correctness rather than security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Pattern comparison with CVE commits**: The similar commits with CVE status YES all fixed actual security vulnerabilities:
     - Packet corruption in UDP tunnels
     - Buffer overflow potential (BUG_ON crashes)
     - Inner protocol corruption
     
     This commit doesn't fix any such vulnerabilities; it's purely an optimization.
05872a167c2ca f2fs: fix to do sanity check on sbi->total_valid_block_count
- [sasha] Let me check the historical commits shown in the examples more carefully. They show similar patterns where sanity checks are added to prevent crashes from corrupted filesystem metadata.
  Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Boundary Violation**: The commit fixes a kernel panic (DoS) that can be triggered by mounting a crafted/corrupted F2FS filesystem image. This crosses the security boundary between userspace (mounting filesystems) and kernel space.
  2. **Similar Pattern to CVE-assigned Commits**: The provided examples show that similar F2FS sanity check commits have been assigned CVEs when they:
     - Fix kernel BUG/panic conditions
     - Are triggered by corrupted filesystem metadata
     - Can be exploited through mounting malicious images
     - Come from syzbot reports
  3. **Attack Vector**: The vulnerability can be triggered through normal filesystem operations (creat syscall) on a corrupted F2FS image, making it exploitable by:
     - Local attackers with mount privileges
     - Remote attackers if the system processes untrusted filesystem images
  4. **Impact**: While the immediate impact is DoS (kernel panic), the code change shows this is a critical accounting error where `sbi->total_valid_block_count` becomes less than the blocks being freed, indicating severe metadata corruption that could potentially lead to memory safety issues.
  5. **Root Cause**: The commit message states this fixes an issue dating back to the initial F2FS implementation ("Fixes: 39a53e0ce0df"), indicating this is a long-standing vulnerability in production kernels.
  The change from `f2fs_bug_on()` to a warning is a security-critical fix that prevents attackers from causing system crashes through crafted filesystem images.
d26fecb03e1f1 f2fs: prevent the current section from being selected as a victim during GC
- [sasha] Now I need to analyze the actual changes in the commit. Let me look at the specific changes to understand the issue better.
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the f2fs code, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a filesystem consistency bug, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes an issue where:
     - A section could be selected as a GC victim via `next_victim_seg`
     - That same section could then be allocated as the current section (curseg) for new writes
     - This causes inconsistency between SIT and SSA metadata structures
  2. **Impact Analysis**:
     - The primary impact is filesystem corruption/inconsistency, as evidenced by the error message: "Inconsistent segment (70961) type [0, 1] in SSA and SIT"
     - The result is a call to `f2fs_stop_checkpoint()` which prevents further filesystem operations
     - This is essentially a denial-of-service condition requiring filesystem repair
  3. **Exploitability**:
     - This requires legitimate filesystem operations (garbage collection) to trigger
     - There's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data disclosure
     - The bug manifests as metadata inconsistency, not exploitable memory safety issues
  4. **Code Changes**:
     - The fix simply clears `next_victim_seg[BG_GC/FG_GC]` when a section becomes free
     - This prevents the race condition where a freed section selected as a victim gets reallocated
     - The changes are purely preventive logic to maintain consistency
  5. **Security Relevance**:
     - While this could cause filesystem unavailability (DoS), it's not a traditional security vulnerability
     - No attacker-controlled input or exploitation path exists
     - The issue is a race condition in normal filesystem operations
  The commit fixes a reliability/consistency issue rather than a security vulnerability. Similar to commit "f2fs: check curseg->inited before write_sum_page in change_curseg" which was marked as NO for CVE, this addresses filesystem robustness without introducing security implications.
05d3273ad03fa f2fs: clean up unnecessary indentation
- [sasha] Let me analyze the actual changes in the commit:
  Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The commit is purely a code cleanup that improves readability by restructuring the `__set_test_and_free()` function. The logic remains completely unchanged.
  2. **Refactoring Only**: The changes involve:
     - Moving the `usable_segs` variable from being declared at the beginning to being used inline as `f2fs_usable_segs_in_sec(sbi)` 
     - Adding early exit points with `goto unlock_out` instead of nested if statements
     - Restructuring the control flow to be more linear and easier to read
  3. **Identical Behavior**: Both versions:
     - Hold the same spinlock
     - Perform the same bit operations in the same order
     - Update the same counters under the same conditions
     - Handle the `IS_CURSEC` check identically
  4. **No Bug Fixes**: The commit message explicitly states "No functional change" and the code analysis confirms this. There are no fixes for:
     - Race conditions
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control issues
     - Input validation problems
     - Any other security-relevant bugs
  This is a typical maintenance commit that improves code quality without addressing any vulnerability. Similar to the reference commits shown (which were all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this is purely cosmetic refactoring.
6af396942bf13 wifi: ath12k: fix ATH12K_FLAG_REGISTERED flag handling
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit message and code changes more carefully to understand the issue.
  Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a logic error in flag management during driver initialization/registration. The ATH12K_FLAG_REGISTERED flag was only being set for the first device (ag->ab[0]) in a hardware group, but not for other devices in the group.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The code changes show this is purely a functional bug that affects driver state management during recovery scenarios. The flag is used to:
     - Track whether a device has been registered with mac80211
     - Control recovery behavior (as seen in core.c recovery code)
     - Manage regulatory domain updates (as seen in wmi.c)
  3. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The bug could cause issues during recovery for devices other than the first one in a hardware group
     - It doesn't create any exploitable condition
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - No unauthorized access or denial of service vulnerability
  4. **Code changes**: The fix simply moves the flag setting/clearing from mac.c (where it only affected ag->ab[0]) to core.c where it properly sets the flag for all devices in the group during start/stop operations.
  5. **Similar commits comparison**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO", they are also functional bugs (incorrect flag usage, uninitialized variables, registration issues). The one marked "CVE Status: YES" was a use-after-free vulnerability - a clear memory safety issue.
  This is a straightforward functional bug fix that ensures proper driver state management across all devices in a hardware group, with no security implications.
6d019abc402f5 wifi: ath12k: fix SLUB BUG - Object already free in ath12k_reg_free()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Timing and trigger**: The double-free occurs specifically during module removal (`rmmod`) as stated in the commit message. This is not a runtime vulnerability that can be exploited during normal operation.
  2. **Attack surface**: Module removal typically requires root/CAP_SYS_MODULE privileges. An attacker who can unload kernel modules already has significant system access.
  3. **Nature of the bug**: While this is a memory corruption issue (double-free leading to SLUB debug detection), it manifests during cleanup/shutdown paths when the driver is being removed from the system, not during normal operation.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: 
     - The two reverts (commits 1 & 2) were marked differently because they were fixing incorrect backports of security fixes
     - Commits 3, 4, and 5 deal with memory leaks and use-after-free issues that could occur during normal runtime operation or in error paths
     - This commit fixes a double-free that only occurs during the module removal sequence
  5. **Code analysis**: The fix adds mutex protection and nullifies pointers after freeing to prevent the double-free. The issue only manifests when multiple devices in a hardware group are being torn down during module removal, which is a controlled administrative action.
  The bug is a quality issue that should be fixed but does not represent a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker during normal system operation.
8c7a5031a6b0d wifi: ath12k: Fix buffer overflow in debugfs
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security impact. Looking at the commit change:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Memory Corruption Vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states "If the user tries to write more than 32 bytes then it results in memory corruption." This is a clear security vulnerability.
  2. **Buffer Overflow**: The code allocates a fixed 32-byte buffer (`const int size = 32; char *buf = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)`) but then copies user input without checking the count: `copy_from_user(buf, user_buf, count)`. If count > 32, this causes a heap buffer overflow.
  3. **Exploitable by Root**: While the commit mentions this is "limited to root users" through debugfs, this is still a significant security issue because:
     - Root privilege escalation vulnerabilities are still CVE-worthy
     - In container environments, root in container might not be full system root
     - This could potentially be used to bypass kernel protections or cause system instability
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed an out-of-bounds access in array indexing
     - Commit 3 & 4 (CVE: YES) fixed invalid data access that could lead to memory corruption
     - This commit fixes a similar memory safety issue
  5. **The fix is simple but critical**: Adding `if (count > size) return -EINVAL;` prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring the user cannot write more data than the allocated buffer size.
  The vulnerability allows writing beyond the allocated 32-byte buffer on the heap, which could potentially lead to kernel heap corruption, crashes, or in worst case scenarios, arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
1a0e65750b55d wifi: ath12k: Fix WMI tag for EHT rate in peer assoc
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the security implications. Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a simple tag mismatch where `WMI_TAG_HE_RATE_SET` was incorrectly used instead of `WMI_TAG_EHT_RATE_SET` when encoding EHT (802.11be) rate parameters. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No Memory Corruption**: Both structures (`ath12k_wmi_he_rate_set_params` and `ath12k_wmi_eht_rate_set_params`) have identical layouts with the same fields (tlv_header, rx_mcs_set, tx_mcs_set), so there's no buffer overflow or memory corruption risk.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The incorrect tag would cause the firmware to misinterpret EHT rate information as HE rate information during peer association. This affects functionality (EHT rates wouldn't be properly configured) but doesn't create any security risks like:
     - No privilege escalation
     - No unauthorized access
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond potential connectivity issues
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix incorrect flag usage (commit 1) or incorrect calculations (commit 2) were marked as NO CVE. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a configuration/protocol error that affects functionality but not security.
  5. **Compare to CVE Commit**: The commit marked as CVE (commit 5) involved a potential out-of-bounds write due to unchecked array indexing with untrusted input, which is a clear security vulnerability. This current commit has no such security implications.
  The commit simply fixes a copy-paste error where the wrong WMI tag was used, affecting only the proper configuration of EHT rates in the wireless driver.
d61c0b3c63462 wifi: ath12k: Resolve multicast packet drop by populating key_cipher in ath12k_install_key()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning based on the code analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that multicast packets are being **dropped** (not sent unencrypted) due to incorrect key_cipher population in MLD AP configurations. The commit message explicitly states this fixes "multicast packet drop".
  2. **Limited security impact**: The bug causes a denial of service through packet drops, but does not lead to:
     - Information disclosure (packets are dropped, not sent in plaintext)
     - Privilege escalation
     - Memory corruption or code execution
     - Authentication/authorization bypass
  3. **Functional vs Security bug**: This is primarily a functional issue where the comparison `ether_addr_equal(macaddr, vif->addr)` fails in MLD AP mode because the link address differs from the virtual interface address. The fix changes it to compare with `arvif->bssid` instead.
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 2 and 3 (ath12k read-after-free) received CVEs because they involved memory safety issues
     - Commit 1 (cipher handling fix) did NOT receive a CVE despite fixing encryption-related functionality
     - Commits 4 and 5 (configuration/cipher fixes) did NOT receive CVEs
  This commit is similar to commit 1 - it fixes encryption configuration handling but doesn't introduce a security vulnerability. The worst outcome is service disruption through dropped multicast packets, which is generally not considered CVE-worthy unless it enables a significant denial of service attack vector.
6177c97fb6f05 wifi: ath12k: fix cleanup path after mhi init
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it with the similar commits provided:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a simple cleanup path ordering issue where the `err_pci_msi_free` label was placed incorrectly in the error handling sequence. The fix simply moves the label to the correct position after `err_irq_affinity_cleanup`.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: Unlike the similar commits that were assigned CVEs (which fixed actual crashes, kernel warnings, or system instability issues), this commit only fixes the order of cleanup operations in the probe error path. The misplaced label would only affect resource cleanup order during driver initialization failure.
  3. **No exploitation potential**: The incorrect cleanup order doesn't create any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker. It's purely a resource management issue during error handling.
  4. **Limited impact**: The issue only affects the error path during driver probe when initialization fails. It doesn't affect normal operation, doesn't cause crashes, memory corruption, or allow privilege escalation.
  5. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The similar commits with CVE status YES fixed:
     - Kernel warnings and potential crashes due to IRQ affinity not being cleared before freeing IRQs
     - NULL pointer dereferences causing kernel crashes
     - Double-free issues leading to system instability
     This commit, in contrast, only reorders cleanup labels without fixing any crash, warning, or instability issue.
  The incorrect label ordering might cause resources to be freed in a suboptimal order during error conditions, but this doesn't constitute a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
e5566162af8b9 net: phy: mediatek: permit to compile test GE SOC PHY driver
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It's a build configuration fix that:
  1. **Only changes Kconfig dependencies** - The change modifies the dependency from:
     ```
     depends on (ARM64 && ARCH_MEDIATEK) || COMPILE_TEST
     depends on NVMEM_MTK_EFUSE
     ```
     to:
     ```
     depends on (ARM64 && ARCH_MEDIATEK && NVMEM_MTK_EFUSE) || COMPILE_TEST
     ```
  2. **Enables compile testing without runtime functionality** - The driver can be compiled without NVMEM_MTK_EFUSE because the NVMEM API provides stub functions that return errors when CONFIG_NVMEM is not enabled (as seen in nvmem-consumer.h lines 99-123).
  3. **The driver gracefully handles missing NVMEM** - In mtk-ge-soc.c:1158-1161, when nvmem_cell_get() fails (which it will with stubs), the driver simply returns 0 (success) unless it's EPROBE_DEFER, meaning the PHY will work without calibration data.
  4. **No security impact** - This is purely a build system configuration change that allows developers to compile-test the driver without having all dependencies. There's no memory corruption, access control bypass, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed.
  This is similar to the other "NO" CVE examples provided, particularly commits 67aea188f23a and 924d66011f24, which also made Kconfig/build system adjustments without fixing actual security vulnerabilities.
773704c1ef96a f2fs: zone: fix to avoid inconsistence in between SIT and SSA
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what the fix does:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Data Integrity Issue**: The commit fixes an inconsistency between SIT (Segment Information Table) and SSA (Segment Summary Area), which are critical metadata structures in F2FS. The error message "Inconsistent segment (0) type [1, 0] in SSA and SIT" indicates a serious metadata corruption issue.
  2. **System Crash/DoS**: The issue triggers `f2fs_handle_critical_error()` and `f2fs_stop_checkpoint()`, which stops the filesystem operations. This effectively creates a denial of service condition where the filesystem becomes unusable.
  3. **Exploitable Through User Operations**: The testcase shows this can be triggered through normal user operations:
     - Creating a pinned file 
     - Using fallocate to allocate 4GB
     These are legitimate operations that unprivileged users can perform.
  4. **Security Boundary Crossing**: The issue allows userspace operations to corrupt kernel filesystem metadata structures, crossing the userspace/kernel security boundary.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - They fix issues where fuzzing or specific operations cause filesystem panics
     - They prevent metadata corruption
     - They fix issues in the same subsystem (F2FS segment management)
  The fix adds a check `if (IS_CURSEC(sbi, GET_SEC_FROM_SEG(sbi, segno))) continue;` to skip garbage collection on current sections that are actively being written to, preventing the metadata inconsistency. This is a clear security fix preventing filesystem corruption and system instability.
5ca2e29f6834c bpf, sockmap: Fix panic when calling skb_linearize
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes and commit message:
  1. **Security Impact - Kernel Panic/DoS**: The commit fixes a kernel panic (BUG_ON assertion failure) that can be triggered by userspace through a specific sequence of operations. The panic occurs at `BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb))` in `pskb_expand_head()`, which causes a kernel crash and system denial of service.
  2. **User-Triggerable**: The commit message explicitly shows this can be triggered by a userspace command:
     ```
     ./bench sockmap -c 2 -p 1 -a --rx-verdict-ingress --rx-strp 100000
     ```
     This means an unprivileged user with access to BPF/sockmap functionality can crash the system.
  3. **Root Cause**: The issue stems from the previous fix (commit a454d84ee20b) which added `skb_get()` to prevent a use-after-free race condition. However, this increased the skb reference count, making `skb_shared()` return true, which triggers the BUG_ON assertion when `skb_linearize()` is called.
  4. **Attack Vector**: The attack requires:
     - BPF/sockmap functionality to be available
     - Ability to send data that exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS (triggering skb_linearize)
     - Use of strparser module with large payloads (100KB in the example)
  5. **Similar CVE Patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Multiple sockmap-related memory issues have been assigned CVEs
     - Issues that cause kernel panics or crashes are typically CVE-worthy
     - The pattern of fixing one security issue but introducing another is common in CVE assignments
  The fix moves the `skb_get()` call into `sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue()` with a conditional `take_ref` parameter to avoid the shared skb issue while still preventing the original use-after-free race condition.
3b4f14b794287 bpf, sockmap: fix duplicated data transmission
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific code changes in detail. Looking at the diff:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Data Integrity Violation**: The bug causes duplicated data transmission to the receiver, which is a data integrity issue. As described in the commit message, "partial skb data might be transmitted" but the retry path "resend the entire skb data instead of continuing from the previous offset, resulting in data overlap at the receiver side."
  2. **Security Impact**: This is similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the historical references:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed a memory leak that could cause system warnings
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) fixed a potential memory leak on error paths
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) fixed a NULL pointer dereference
     
     This commit fixes a data corruption issue where duplicate data is sent over the network, which can have security implications.
  3. **Code Analysis**: The fix shows that the state restoration logic was incorrect:
     ```c
     - if (unlikely(state->len)) {
     -     len = state->len;
     -     off = state->off;
     - }
     ```
     Was moved to inside the loop after the SKB parameters were initialized:
     ```c
     + /* Resume processing from previous partial state */
     + if (unlikely(state->len)) {
     +     len = state->len;
     +     off = state->off;
     + }
     ```
  4. **Attack Vector**: This bug could potentially be exploited by:
     - Causing network conditions that trigger partial sends (EAGAIN)
     - Leading to data corruption at the receiver
     - Potentially causing application-level security issues due to duplicated data
  5. **Clear State Management**: The fix also adds proper state clearing after successful transmission:
     ```c
     + /* The entire skb sent, clear state */
     + sk_psock_skb_state(psock, state, 0, 0);
     ```
  The bug represents a data integrity violation in the kernel's BPF sockmap implementation that could lead to security issues in applications relying on correct data transmission semantics.
54a3ecaeeeae8 bpf: fix ktls panic with sockmap
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here's my assessment:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes and commit analysis:
  1. **The issue causes a kernel panic/BUG**: The commit message shows a kernel BUG at lib/iov_iter.c:629, which corresponds to a BUG() call in iov_iter_revert() when dealing with ITER_UBUF iterators. This is a denial of service vulnerability.
  2. **Security-relevant BPF interaction**: The vulnerability occurs when BPF programs interact with TLS/kTLS sockets through sockmap. BPF programs can execute bpf_msg_push_data() which increases msg_pl->sg.size, leading to an incorrect calculation when reverting the iterator.
  3. **The bug triggers a specific security check**: Looking at line 625-629 in iov_iter.c:
     ```c
     if (iov_iter_is_xarray(i) || iter_is_ubuf(i)) {
         BUG(); /* We should never go beyond the start of the specified
                * range since we might then be straying into pages that
                * aren't pinned.
                */
     }
     ```
     This BUG() is specifically there to prevent accessing unpinned memory pages, which is a security boundary.
  4. **The issue allows BPF programs to crash the kernel**: Any BPF program with access to sockmap operations can trigger this crash by:
     - Setting cork_bytes
     - Using bpf_msg_push_data() to increase the message size
     - Returning -ENOSPC when sg.size < cork_bytes
     - Causing the incorrect rollback calculation
  5. **Remote triggerable**: Since BPF programs can be triggered by network traffic in many configurations, this could potentially be triggered remotely depending on the BPF program deployment.
  The fix prevents the incorrect rollback by handling the cork_bytes case differently, avoiding the problematic iov_iter_revert() call with an incorrect size calculation.
  This meets the criteria for a CVE as it's a kernel crash (DoS) that can be triggered through BPF programs interacting with network sockets.
967e8def1100c selftests/bpf: Fix bpf_nf selftest failure
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Test infrastructure only**: The changes are exclusively in the selftests directory (`tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/bpf_nf.c`), which is test code that doesn't run in production kernels.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The commit simply adds a check to skip a test when `iptables-legacy` tool is missing. This prevents a test failure but doesn't fix any security issue.
  3. **No kernel code affected**: This change doesn't modify any kernel functionality, drivers, or security-sensitive components. It only improves test reliability by properly handling missing test dependencies.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All the provided similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also selftests changes that add helper libraries, fix test issues, or add new test cases - none of which constitute security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a quality-of-life improvement for developers running BPF selftests, ensuring tests gracefully skip when required tools are unavailable rather than failing.
a76116f422c44 bpf: Check link_create.flags parameter for multi_uprobe
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the kernel code:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit adds missing input validation for the `link_create.flags` parameter in the `bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach()` function. This is a correctness fix that ensures the API behaves consistently with other BPF link types (cgroup, net_namespace, bpf_iter, etc.), which all reject non-zero values for unused flags.
  2. **No security impact**: The missing validation doesn't allow any privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security issues. The `link_create.flags` field is simply ignored in the current implementation. Setting arbitrary values in this field doesn't affect the behavior of the uprobe attachment or bypass any security checks.
  3. **API consistency fix**: The change enforces that callers must pass 0 for the currently unused `link_create.flags` field, preventing future compatibility issues if flags are added later. This is a standard practice in kernel APIs to reject unknown flags.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, this is most similar to commits 1-3 which were marked as non-CVE. Those commits also dealt with BPF uprobe functionality improvements and fixes without security implications.
  The commit is purely a defensive programming practice to ensure proper API usage and maintain consistency across BPF link types, not a fix for any exploitable security issue.
243911982aa9f bpf: Check link_create.flags parameter for multi_kprobe
- [sasha] Looking at the similar commits history and the code changes, let me summarize my findings:
  ## Analysis Summary
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is an input validation enhancement that adds a missing check for the `link_create.flags` parameter. The commit ensures that if any flags are set in `attr->link_create.flags`, the function returns -EINVAL.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The lack of this check does not create a security vulnerability. The `link_create.flags` field was simply being ignored for kprobe_multi attachments. This is inconsistent API behavior but not a security issue because:
     - No malicious code execution path exists
     - No privilege escalation is possible
     - No memory corruption or information disclosure occurs
     - The flags field is simply ignored, not misused
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 & 2 (CVE Status: NO) were simple bug fixes and enhancements
     - Similar Commit 3 & 5 (CVE Status: YES) fixed an actual security issue where incorrect attach types could bypass security checks for cgroup_skb programs
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: NO) was a verifier enhancement for return value validation
  4. **Impact assessment**: The commit message explicitly states "The link_create.flags are currently not used for multi-kprobes" - this indicates the flags were simply ignored rather than being misinterpreted in a dangerous way. The fix improves API consistency by rejecting non-zero flags like other attach APIs do.
  5. **No privilege bypass**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commits that allowed bypassing attach type restrictions (which could lead to running programs in unexpected contexts), this commit only adds validation for an unused field.
  The change is a good practice for API consistency and prevents future issues if flags are added, but it does not fix an existing security vulnerability.
4dab26bed5435 IB/cm: use rwlock for MAD agent lock
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I'll now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Performance optimization, not a security fix**: The commit clearly states it's addressing a performance issue with lock contention, not a security vulnerability. The commit message describes "heavy contention for mad_agent_lock" leading to performance problems, not security issues.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: While the commit mentions symptoms like "machine becoming unresponsive, hung task warnings, netdev TX timeouts", these are performance/availability issues under heavy load (512 parallel connections in the reproducer), not security vulnerabilities. The system degrades under load but doesn't expose sensitive data or allow privilege escalation.
  3. **Lock type change only**: The change is from a spinlock to a rwlock (read-write lock), which is a standard optimization when there are many readers and few writers. The protection mechanism remains intact - just more efficient. The commit shows:
     - `spin_lock` → `read_lock` for read operations (in `cm_alloc_msg` and `cm_form_tid`)
     - `spin_lock` → `write_lock` for write operations (in `cm_remove_one`)
  4. **No exploitation path**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this issue to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause data corruption. The worst case is a DoS-like condition under extreme load, which is a quality-of-service issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to commit 3**: The third similar commit (fixing spin lock usage in bnxt_re) was marked as "CVE Status: NO" and involved similar lock optimization without security implications.
  The issue fixed here is a scalability/performance problem that causes system responsiveness issues under heavy RDMA connection load, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
be908d2360341 wifi: ath12k: Fix invalid memory access while forming 802.11 header
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
6f8a27a584b23 wifi: ath12k: Fix memory corruption during MLO multicast tx
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the complete issue. Let me trace through what happens:
  1. For each link in MLO multicast, a copy of the skb is made
  2. `skb_cb = ATH12K_SKB_CB(msdu_copied)` gets the driver's control block from the copied skb
  3. The driver sets `skb_cb->link_id = link_id` 
  4. Then the problematic line: `info->control.hw_key = key` writes to the control union
  5. Since `control` and `driver_data` are in a union, this overwrites the driver's data
  ## Analysis Summary:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Memory Corruption**: The commit fixes a genuine memory corruption issue where the `info->control.hw_key = key` assignment overwrites the driver's control block data (`ath12k_skb_cb`) because both `control` and `driver_data` fields occupy the same memory location within the `ieee80211_tx_info` union.
  2. **Security Impact**: This memory corruption affects critical fields in `ath12k_skb_cb`:
     - `link_id`: Used to identify which link to transmit on
     - `flags`: Contains security-related flags like `ATH12K_SKB_CIPHER_SET`
     - Other fields that control packet transmission
  3. **Exploitability**: A corrupted `link_id` could cause:
     - Packets to be transmitted on the wrong interface/link
     - Information disclosure by sending data to unintended recipients
     - Potential privilege escalation if packets bypass security checks
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This issue is similar to "Similar Commit 4" (wl1251 memory leak) and "Similar Commit 5" (ath10k memory leak) which were both assigned CVEs for memory management issues that could lead to denial of service or information disclosure.
  5. **Affected Component**: The vulnerability affects MLO (Multi-Link Operation) multicast transmission in ath12k driver, which is used in production Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) devices.
  The fix correctly removes the line `info->control.hw_key = key;` since the key information is already properly stored in `skb_cb->cipher` and the frame protection is handled by setting the protected bit in the frame control field.
75ec94db880b1 wifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak during vdev_id mismatch
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
75011ad69bc54 libbpf: Fix implicit memfd_create() for bionic
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a build/compilation issue on Android bionic libc platforms where `memfd_create()` is not consistently available. The fix simply relocates an existing `sys_memfd_create()` helper function from `libbpf.c` to `libbpf_internal.h` and replaces the direct `memfd_create()` call with the syscall wrapper.
  This is purely a portability fix with no security implications:
  - It does not fix any runtime vulnerability
  - The syscall wrapper performs the exact same operation as the libc function
  - The change only affects build compatibility on certain Android platforms
  - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure issues are involved
  The commit message explicitly states this is fixing an "implicit declaration of function" build error, which is a compilation issue, not a security vulnerability.
31e98e277ae47 wifi: ath11k: fix node corruption in ar->arvifs list
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
ea24531d00f78 wifi: ath12k: fix NULL access in assign channel context handler
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs in a debug logging statement (`ath12k_warn()`). The NULL access happens when trying to log an error message, not during critical security-sensitive operations.
  2. **Error path only**: The issue only occurs in an error handling path when `ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()` fails and returns NULL. The function already handles the failure correctly by returning `-EINVAL`.
  3. **No exploitation potential**: The NULL dereference in `arvif->ar->ab` for logging purposes cannot be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts. It would at most cause a kernel oops in the error path.
  4. **Debug/logging fix**: The fix simply changes from `ath12k_warn(arvif->ar->ab, ...)` to `ath12k_hw_warn(ah, ...)` to use a valid handle for logging. This is a robustness improvement, not a security fix.
  Unlike the similar commits that were assigned CVEs (which involved use-after-free vulnerabilities, NULL dereferences in data processing paths, or memory corruption issues), this commit only fixes a NULL dereference in error logging code with no security implications.
675008f196ca5 drm/panic: Use a decimal fifo to avoid u64 by u64 divide
- [sasha] Now I can see that `drm_panic` is a kernel panic handler that displays information on screen when a kernel panic occurs. It's registered via `kmsg_dump_register` with `KMSG_DUMP_PANIC` reason.
  Let me examine similar commits to understand the CVE assignment pattern better:
  **Analysis of the commit:**
  1. **What does the code do?** 
     - This is part of the DRM panic handler that displays a QR code on screen during kernel panics
     - The code encodes panic information into a QR code for users to scan
  2. **What is the issue being fixed?**
     - On 32-bit ARM, u64 division is not supported natively
     - The original code used `self.carry / pow` where both are u64 values
     - This causes a compile/link error on ARM32 because the required intrinsics aren't available in kernel
  3. **Security implications:**
     - This is a **build/compile-time issue**, not a runtime vulnerability
     - The code would fail to compile on 32-bit ARM, not cause a security issue
     - No memory corruption, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure
     - This is purely a portability/compatibility fix
  4. **Comparison with similar commits:**
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed actual divide-by-zero that could cause panic at runtime
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: NO) - Fixed a Clippy warning, no security impact
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed divide-by-zero in vrefresh calculation
     - Similar Commit 4 & 5 (CVE: YES) - Fixed integer overflow vulnerabilities
  The pattern shows CVEs are assigned for runtime vulnerabilities (divide-by-zero, integer overflow) that can cause crashes or undefined behavior, but not for build-time compatibility issues.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a compile-time compatibility issue on 32-bit ARM platforms where u64 division is not supported. The issue prevents the code from building on ARM32, but does not represent a security vulnerability. It's a portability fix that replaces an algorithm to avoid using u64 division operations that aren't available in the kernel environment on 32-bit ARM. Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed runtime divide-by-zero or integer overflow issues), this is purely a build-time problem with no security implications.
57145afa33269 drm/panic: clean Clippy warning
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure style change**: The change from `self.carry = self.carry % pow;` to `self.carry %= pow;` is a purely stylistic change that addresses a Clippy warning. Both expressions are semantically identical in Rust.
  2. **No functional impact**: The compound assignment operator `%=` performs the exact same operation as the manual assignment - it calculates the modulo and assigns the result back to the variable. There is no change in behavior, logic, or security properties.
  3. **Context shows non-security code**: This code is part of the DRM panic QR code generator, which creates QR codes for kernel panic messages. The specific function is encoding numeric data for QR code generation. The modulo operation is used to maintain a carry value during numeric encoding - a purely algorithmic operation with no security implications.
  4. **Similar to other style fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), they all address various Clippy warnings and style issues in the same drm_panic_qr.rs file, and none were assigned CVEs. These include fixing documentation formatting, boolean expressions, and other style cleanups.
  5. **No vulnerability fixed**: There is no security vulnerability being fixed here - no buffer overflow, no memory corruption, no privilege escalation, no information leak, or any other security issue. It's simply making the code conform to Rust's idiomatic style guidelines.
e22d7acf9f47b drm/xe/guc: Make creation of SLPC debugfs files conditional
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it does fix a NULL pointer dereference, this is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The issue only occurs when reading from a debugfs file (`/sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/guc_pc`). Debugfs is typically only accessible to root/privileged users and is often not even mounted in production systems.
  2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: This is a local denial of service that requires already having privileged access to the debugfs filesystem. An attacker who can access debugfs already has significant system privileges.
  3. **Debugging Interface**: The affected code is in a debugging interface, not a production-critical path. Debugfs is explicitly designed for debugging purposes and not considered a security boundary.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: The similar commits shown (like "Properly handle alloc_guc_id() failure" and "Restore EIO errno return") also fix potential crashes or error handling issues but were marked as NO for CVE assignment. They represent code quality improvements rather than security fixes.
  The fix properly conditions the creation of the debugfs file on SLPC support being available, preventing the NULL pointer dereference from occurring. This is a bug fix for robustness, not a security vulnerability fix.
387444984d7b5 drm/xe/guc: Don't expose GuC privileged debugfs files if VF
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the xe driver codebase, here is my CVE assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does NOT warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Access Control Enhancement, Not Vulnerability Fix**: The commit adds proper access controls to prevent VFs from accessing debugfs files they shouldn't access. This is a security hardening measure that implements proper isolation, not a fix for an existing vulnerability that could be exploited.
  2. **debugfs is Debug-Only Interface**: The debugfs filesystem is intended for debugging purposes and is typically not mounted or accessible in production environments. It requires root privileges to access.
  3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The commit prevents VFs from accessing:
     - GuC logs that contain system-wide debugging information
     - GuC PC (Power Conservation) controls that manage host-level power states
     
     However, there's no indication that VFs could previously exploit this access to:
     - Escape their virtualization boundaries
     - Gain elevated privileges
     - Cause denial of service
     - Access memory they shouldn't
  4. **Preventive Security Measure**: The commit message states "Don't expose those files on the VF driver" which indicates this is a preventive measure to properly implement the SRIOV security model, rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
  5. **Pattern in xe Driver**: The codebase shows consistent patterns of `IS_SRIOV_VF()` checks throughout to restrict VF access to various hardware features. This commit extends that pattern to debugfs, making the security model more consistent.
  The commit improves security by properly enforcing VF isolation in debugfs, but it doesn't fix a vulnerability that could be actively exploited for malicious purposes. It's a defense-in-depth measure that prevents potential information disclosure through debug interfaces.
e15826bb3c2c5 drm/xe/guc: Refactor GuC debugfs initialization
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Pure refactoring with no functional changes**: The commit message explicitly states "Note that there is no change in file/directory structure, just refactored how files are created and how functions are called." This is purely a code organization improvement.
  2. **No security-relevant changes**: The commit:
     - Removes the need for `drmm_kmalloc()` to create a local copy of debugfs_list
     - Changes how the xe_guc pointer is extracted (from stored data to extracting from grandparent debugfs entry)
     - Introduces a new generic `guc_debugfs_show()` function that wraps the actual print functions
     - Maintains the same debugfs files with the same functionality
  3. **No vulnerability fixed**: There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption fixes
     - Access control changes
     - Input validation improvements
     - Race condition fixes
     - Information disclosure fixes
     - Any security boundary violations being addressed
  4. **Debugfs is a debugging interface**: These files are typically only accessible with root privileges and are intended for debugging purposes, not production use.
  5. **Code simplification**: The change actually simplifies the code by removing dynamic memory allocation (`drmm_kmalloc()`) and the need to copy the debugfs_list array, which could be seen as a slight improvement in code quality but not a security fix.
  The similar commits provided as reference (all marked with CVE Status: NO) also deal with non-security related changes like lock handling improvements, assertion additions, formatting consistency, and cleanup of unused code - none of which fixed actual security vulnerabilities.
74287971dbb3f xen/x86: fix initial memory balloon target
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on the information I have:
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  **Explanation:**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in the Xen balloon driver where the initial memory balloon target was not correctly adjusted when extra memory regions were added. The key changes are:
  1. **Bug Description**: When using `dom0_mem=,max:` parameter or domUs with memory != maxmem, the balloon driver would populate memory straight to the max value instead of respecting the intended target. This happens because `balloon_stats.target_pages` was not being adjusted when extra memory regions were added as ballooned pages.
  2. **Code Changes**: The fix adds a single line:
     ```c
     balloon_stats.target_pages -= pages;
     ```
     This ensures that when extra memory regions are added to the balloon, the target is adjusted accordingly.
  3. **Why this is NOT a security vulnerability**:
     - **No privilege escalation**: The bug doesn't allow unprivileged users to gain elevated privileges
     - **No memory corruption**: It doesn't cause buffer overflows, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues
     - **No information disclosure**: It doesn't leak sensitive information
     - **No denial of service**: While it causes unexpected memory consumption, this is a configuration/functional issue, not a security vulnerability
     - **Controlled environment**: This only affects Xen guests and dom0, which are already in a controlled virtualization environment
     - **Configuration issue**: The problem manifests when administrators use specific memory configuration parameters - it's a functional bug that causes the system to not behave as configured
  4. **Impact**: The impact is that memory ballooning doesn't work as expected - the system uses more memory than intended. This is a resource management/configuration issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  This is similar to the referenced historical commits which also dealt with balloon driver initialization and memory accounting issues, none of which were assigned CVEs because they represent functional bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
5924331589057 svcrdma: Reduce the number of rdma_rw contexts per-QP
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a functional bug in resource calculation, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that QP creation fails with -ENOMEM due to an overly aggressive estimation of needed rdma_rw contexts (using `3 * RPCSVC_MAXPAGES`). The fix adjusts this to a more accurate calculation using `rdma_rw_mr_factor()`.
  The -ENOMEM failure is a safe error condition that prevents resource over-allocation, not an exploitable vulnerability. This is purely a configuration/compatibility issue that affects service availability in certain setups but has no security implications like memory corruption, information disclosure, or remote exploitation potential.
11beb0fc346e0 media: verisilicon: Free post processor buffers on error
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The commit fixes a memory leak vulnerability in the error handling path of `hantro_postproc_init()`. When buffer allocation fails partway through initialization (e.g., on buffer 5 out of 64), the function returns an error without freeing the already allocated buffers (0-4), causing a DMA memory leak.
  Key security implications:
  1. **Resource exhaustion**: An attacker with access to the video device can repeatedly trigger streaming initialization under memory pressure to leak DMA buffers
  2. **Significant memory impact**: With up to 64 buffers (MAX_POSTPROC_BUFFERS) and large buffer sizes for high-resolution video formats, hundreds of MB of DMA memory could be leaked per attempt
  3. **Persistent leak**: The leaked memory remains allocated until module unload or system reboot
  This is directly comparable to Similar Commits 1 & 2, which were assigned CVEs for fixing memory leaks in `allocate_buffers_internal()` where buffers weren't freed on allocation failure. The security impact and vulnerability pattern are essentially identical.
94c9337165670 drm/mediatek: mtk_drm_drv: Unbind secondary mmsys components on err
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning based on the code analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a resource cleanup issue in error handling paths. The commit adds proper component unbinding when initialization fails for secondary mmsys instances:
     ```c
     if (ret) {
         while (--i >= 0)
             component_unbind_all(private->all_drm_private[i]->dev, drm);
         return ret;
     }
     ```
  2. **Limited security impact**: 
     - This is primarily a resource leak that leaves components in a bound state when they should be cleaned up
     - The issue only occurs during driver initialization failure paths, not during normal operation
     - It requires specific hardware (MT8195 with multiple mmsys) and a component binding failure to trigger
  3. **No direct exploitability**:
     - The bug doesn't expose sensitive information
     - It doesn't allow privilege escalation
     - It doesn't enable remote code execution
     - At worst, it could cause resource exhaustion through repeated failed initializations, but this would require privileged access to repeatedly load/unload the driver
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the reference commits provided, they are all marked as "CVE Status: NO" and involve similar driver initialization, compatibility fixes, and resource management improvements without direct security implications.
  This is a quality/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix. The missing cleanup could theoretically lead to state inconsistencies, but there's no demonstrated path to exploit this for any security impact.
80805b62ea5b9 drm/mediatek: Fix kobject put for component sub-drivers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, my answer is:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Different Reference Counting Issue**: The commit message clearly states this is fixing a reference count issue with `device_find_child()` in `mtk_drm_get_all_drm_priv()`, not `of_find_device_by_node()`. The fix adds `put_device()` calls for devices obtained via `device_find_child()`.
  2. **Nature of the Fix**: Looking at the actual code changes:
     - In `err_put_dev:` error path: Adds `put_device(private->all_drm_private[i]->dev)` 
     - In `mtk_drm_unbind()`: Adds the same `put_device()` calls
     - The comment explicitly states "/* For device_find_child in mtk_drm_get_all_priv() */"
  3. **Resource Leak vs Security Vulnerability**: This is primarily a resource leak that could potentially lead to denial of service under specific conditions (repeated bind failures), but:
     - It requires specific failure scenarios to trigger
     - Modern kernels have `refcount_t` overflow protection that prevents wraparound
     - The impact is limited to resource exhaustion, not memory corruption
  4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them were assigned CVEs, and they all fix driver-specific issues like:
     - Missing compatible strings
     - Reference counting in error paths
     - Resource cleanup issues
     - None involve security boundaries or privileged operations
  5. **Attack Surface**: The vulnerability requires the ability to trigger component bind failures repeatedly, which is not a common attack vector and would likely require privileged access to manipulate driver binding.
  The commit is fixing a legitimate bug (reference leak), but it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it's more of a quality/resource management issue than a security vulnerability with realistic exploitation potential.
22918591fb747 drm/mediatek: mtk_drm_drv: Fix kobject put for mtk_mutex device ptr
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparing it to the similar commits provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a refcount handling bug fix that prevents potential refcount_t underflow/overflow warnings, but it's not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes incorrect reference counting of the mutex_dev kobject during error paths and unbind operations.
  2. **Limited Attack Surface**: 
     - The issue only manifests during driver bind/unbind operations
     - Requires either root privileges or physical access to trigger repeated bind failures
     - Cannot be exploited by unprivileged users or remotely
  3. **Impact Analysis**:
     - The primary impact is kernel warnings (refcount_t underflow/overflow warnings)
     - No direct memory corruption or exploitable condition
     - The warnings are safety mechanisms preventing actual security issues
  4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 & 2: Adding dummy clocks to fix DT bindings - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 3 & 4: Adding error checking for DPCD reads - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 5: Changing prints to avoid NULL pointer - YES CVE (but that was an actual NULL pointer dereference)
  5. **Code Changes**: The fix simply adds proper `put_device()` calls in error paths and unbind to match the reference taken by `of_find_device_by_node()`. This is a resource leak fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
  The commit prevents resource leaks and potential system instability but doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability. It's a quality/correctness fix rather than a security fix.
a92e390e0d438 drm/i915/dp_mst: Use the correct connector while computing the link BPP limit on MST
- [sasha] Looking at the changes, the key modification is:
  - Before: `intel_dp->attached_connector` was passed to `intel_dp_compute_config_link_bpp_limits()`
  - After: The actual `connector` parameter is passed instead
  This is important because in an MST setup:
  - `intel_dp->attached_connector` refers to the MST root connector (the physical port)
  - The `connector` parameter refers to the actual MST stream connector being configured
  The DSC capabilities can be different between:
  1. The MST root device (physical port)
  2. Branch devices downstream 
  3. The actual sink device
  **Analysis:**
  This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The issue is:
  1. **No security boundary crossed**: This is purely about incorrect DSC capability calculation for display configuration. It doesn't involve:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Any security boundaries
  2. **Impact is functional only**: Using wrong DSC capabilities could lead to:
     - Incorrect display bandwidth calculations
     - Failed display configuration
     - Sub-optimal compression settings
     - Display not working at expected resolutions
  3. **No exploitable condition**: An attacker cannot leverage this bug to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Crash the system maliciously
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Bypass security controls
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all deal with DSC/BPP calculation fixes and none were assigned CVEs, as they're all functional display driver fixes.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in the display driver where incorrect DSC capabilities were being used for MST configurations. While this could cause display configuration failures or sub-optimal compression settings, it has no security implications. The bug only affects display functionality and cannot be exploited to compromise system security, leak information, or bypass access controls.
7513ccb8840b5 drm/msm/dp: Prepare for link training per-segment for LTTPRs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This commit fixes an initialization order issue where the LTTPR count needs to be stored during initialization for later use in link training. The changes are:
     - Converting `msm_dp_display_lttpr_init()` from void to int to return the LTTPR count
     - Storing the returned count in `dp->link->lttpr_count`
     - Moving the LTTPR initialization before `msm_dp_panel_read_sink_caps()`
  2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The code changes do not fix a security vulnerability but rather a functional issue:
     - There's no buffer overflow being fixed
     - No memory corruption issue is addressed
     - No privilege escalation or access control bypass
     - No input validation vulnerability
  3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The LTTPR handling operates on DisplayPort hardware initialization paths:
     - Requires physical access to connect malicious LTTPR devices
     - The `drm_dp_lttpr_count()` function already includes bounds checking (returns -ERANGE for invalid values)
     - The count is used for proper initialization sequencing, not for memory allocation
  4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The referenced similar commits (all marked as "CVE Status: NO") show that DisplayPort link training and initialization fixes are typically not assigned CVEs unless they fix actual security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or privilege escalations.
  5. **Functional Impact Only**: The commit message explicitly states this fixes link training failures on certain platforms - a functional issue, not a security issue. Without this fix, DisplayPort connections might fail to establish, but there's no security compromise.
  The commit is a proper bug fix that ensures correct initialization order for LTTPR handling in the DisplayPort driver, but it does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
c156fe2dd4677 drm/msm/dp: Account for LTTPRs capabilities
- [sasha] Now I have a good understanding of the code. Let me analyze the commit in question:
  **Analysis of the commit "drm/msm/dp: Account for LTTPRs capabilities":**
  1. **What the commit fixes:**
     - The commit adds code to properly account for LTTPR (Link Training Tunable PHY Repeater) capabilities when selecting maximum allowed link rate and number of data lanes
     - Previously, the code only considered the sink device's capabilities and device tree limits, but ignored LTTPR limitations
     - LTTPRs are physical layer repeaters that sit between the DisplayPort source and sink
  2. **The specific changes:**
     - Adds checks to limit `link_info->num_lanes` based on `drm_dp_lttpr_max_lane_count()`
     - Adds checks to limit `link_info->rate` based on `drm_dp_lttpr_max_link_rate()`
     - These limitations are applied AFTER the existing device tree limitations
  3. **Security implications analysis:**
     - This is NOT a security vulnerability fix
     - The issue is a functional bug where the driver might try to negotiate link parameters that exceed what the LTTPR hardware can support
     - This could lead to link training failures or display issues, but not security problems
     - There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impact
     - The fix simply ensures proper hardware capability negotiation
  4. **Comparing with similar commits:**
     - Similar commit 5 (CVE Status: YES) fixed an OPP reference count leak, which is a resource management issue that could potentially lead to memory issues
     - This commit is more similar to commits 1-4 which deal with DisplayPort protocol handling and don't have security implications
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a functional issue where LTTPR capabilities were not properly considered during link parameter negotiation. The consequence is potential display connectivity issues or link training failures, not any security vulnerability. The fix ensures proper hardware capability negotiation between all components in the DisplayPort link chain.
9351d3d302060 drm/msm/dp: Fix support of LTTPR initialization
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It corrects a DisplayPort specification compliance issue where LTTPR initialization was happening in the wrong order. The fix moves LTTPR detection to occur before reading DPRX capabilities, as required by DP 2.1a Section 3.6.7.6.1.
  The original code was functionally working because `dp->panel->dpcd` was already populated when `msm_dp_display_lttpr_init()` was called. The fix creates a local dpcd buffer for LTTPR initialization to comply with the specification's ordering requirements. There are no memory safety issues, no potential for exploitation, and no security impact from this ordering problem.
5a9c1bea011fb drm/msm/a6xx: Disable rgb565_predicator on Adreno 7c3
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Configuration correction, not vulnerability fix**: The commit is disabling `rgb565_predicator` for Adreno 7c3 GPU because this feature requires UBWC (Universal Bandwidth Compression) version 4 or later, but the 7c3 GPU has UBWC version 3. This is a configuration/feature compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security implications**: The code change simply removes the line that sets `gpu->ubwc_config.rgb565_predicator = 1;` for the 7c3 GPU. This is a graphics compression feature setting that affects performance/correctness but doesn't have security implications.
  3. **Hardware feature mismatch**: The commit message explicitly states this is about matching the hardware's actual capabilities - the feature was incorrectly enabled for hardware that doesn't support it properly.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked as CVE Status: NO), they involve:
     - Fixing UBWC mode settings
     - Enabling/disabling GPU features  
     - Correcting hardware configurations
     - None of these configuration fixes were assigned CVEs
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication this misconfiguration could be exploited for privilege escalation, memory corruption, denial of service, or any other security impact.
  The commit is simply aligning the driver configuration with the actual hardware capabilities to ensure proper functionality.
73989c998814d selftests/seccomp: fix negative_ENOSYS tracer tests on arm32
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Test Infrastructure Fix Only**: This is a fix to the test harness/selftest infrastructure, not production kernel code. The change is in `tools/testing/selftests/seccomp/seccomp_bpf.c`, which is test code used for validating seccomp functionality.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a test reporting problem where tests were incorrectly reported as failures instead of being skipped. This is a testing accuracy issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Impact Limited to Test Results**: The commit message clearly states the issue is about test results being reported incorrectly: "TRACE_syscall.ptrace.negative_ENOSYS and TRACE_syscall.seccomp.negative_ENOSYS on arm32 are being reported as failures instead of skipping."
  4. **Code Change Analysis**: The fix removes the line `_metadata->exit_code = KSFT_FAIL;` from the teardown function. This prevents the tracer process from overwriting the test result set by the tracee process. This is purely a test framework logic fix.
  5. **No Production Impact**: Selftests are development/testing tools that don't affect the security or functionality of production kernel systems. They're used by developers to validate kernel behavior.
  The commit is similar to the other test infrastructure fixes shown in the examples (commits 1-4) which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO".
097469a2b0f12 perf/amlogic: Replace smp_processor_id() with raw_smp_processor_id() in meson_ddr_pmu_create()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a kernel warning about incorrect API usage (using `smp_processor_id()` in preemptible context), not a security vulnerability. The issue only manifests as a warning message when `CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT` is enabled.
  2. **No security impact**: The code change from `smp_processor_id()` to `raw_smp_processor_id()` does not fix any security vulnerability. It merely suppresses a debugging warning about potential CPU migration during preemption.
  3. **Functional behavior unchanged**: The `pmu->cpu` value is used for:
     - CPU affinity display via sysfs (`meson_ddr_perf_cpumask_show()`)
     - CPU hotplug handling (`ddr_perf_offline_cpu()`)
     - IRQ affinity setting
     
     Even if the CPU changes between reading and using the value, there's no security impact - it just means the PMU might initially be associated with a different CPU than intended.
  4. **Similar commits without CVEs**: Looking at the historical commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1, 2, and 3 (all marked "CVE Status: NO") fix identical `smp_processor_id()` in preemptible context warnings
     - These were all treated as bug fixes, not security issues
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no way for an attacker to leverage this incorrect API usage to gain privileges, cause denial of service, or breach confidentiality. The worst case is incorrect CPU affinity for performance monitoring.
  This is a correctness fix for a kernel API usage warning, similar to the other non-CVE commits shown in the reference examples.
57c8d79adf052 media: synopsys: hdmirx: Count dropped frames
- [sasha] Based on the commit message and code changes provided, let me analyze whether this should be assigned a CVE.
  Looking at the code changes:
  1. **What the commit fixes**: The sequence number increment was previously only happening when a frame was successfully processed (`if (vb_done)`). Now it's moved outside that conditional to always increment, even when frames are dropped.
  2. **The specific change**:
     - Before: `stream->sequence++` was inside the `if (vb_done)` block
     - After: `stream->sequence++` is moved outside, so it increments for every frame regardless of whether it was successfully processed
  3. **Purpose**: The commit message states this is to "communicate the lost frames to userspace" so that applications like GStreamer can properly report frame loss.
  4. **Security implications**: This is a functional fix for proper frame accounting/statistics, not a security vulnerability. The issue was:
     - Userspace applications couldn't detect dropped frames because the sequence number wasn't incrementing
     - This is a quality/functionality issue, not a security issue
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, this type of functional fix (improving frame handling, timing accuracy, etc.) is typical of non-CVE commits in media drivers.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a functional fix that improves frame loss reporting to userspace applications. The issue doesn't involve any security vulnerabilities - it's simply ensuring that sequence numbers properly reflect all frames (including dropped ones) for accurate statistics. This is a quality-of-service improvement rather than a security fix.
0400bee67f497 media: synopsys: hdmirx: Renamed frame_idx to sequence
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is purely a cosmetic variable rename from `frame_idx` to `sequence` with no functional changes. The code analysis shows:
  1. **Simple rename**: All changes are direct replacements of `frame_idx` with `sequence` - the variable type (`u32`), initialization, increment logic, and usage patterns remain identical.
  2. **No security impact**: The commit doesn't modify any:
     - Memory handling or buffer operations
     - Input validation or bounds checking
     - Control flow or logic
     - Access controls or permissions
     - Data processing algorithms
  3. **Documentation improvement**: The rename improves code clarity by matching the internal variable name to the V4L2 API field it populates (`v4l2_buffer.sequence`).
  The commit message explicitly states "No functional changes" and the diff confirms this is accurate. This is routine code maintenance that enhances readability without introducing any vulnerability or security-relevant changes.
d8720235d5b5c scsi: qedf: Use designated initializer for struct qed_fcoe_cb_ops
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Build fix only**: This is purely a compilation fix to address a build error introduced by the randstruct plugin. The error message shows it's a compile-time error: `error: positional initialization of field in 'struct' declared with 'designated_init' attribute`.
  2. **No functional change**: The change from:
     ```c
     static struct qed_fcoe_cb_ops qedf_cb_ops = {
         {
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     static struct qed_fcoe_cb_ops qedf_cb_ops = {
         .common = {
     ```
     is semantically identical. It's just changing from positional initialization to designated initialization.
  3. **No security vulnerability**: The structure `qed_fcoe_cb_ops` contains a `struct qed_common_cb_ops common` member (which is all function pointers) and one additional function pointer. The randstruct plugin requires designated initializers for structures containing only function pointers to enable randomization. This change doesn't fix any memory corruption, access control issues, or other security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Preventive measure**: The randstruct feature itself is a security hardening measure, and this change simply makes the code compatible with that feature. The lack of designated initializers prevented compilation, not caused a runtime security issue.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit #3 (with CVE Status: NO) is also just a code cleanup/maintenance change that uses designated initializers for maintainability, which is similar in nature to this commit.
  The commit is fixing a build regression introduced by enhanced compiler security features, not addressing an actual security vulnerability in the code.
47e36ed784066 overflow: Fix direct struct member initialization in _DEFINE_FLEX()
- [sasha] Looking at the commit and the changed line, I can see the key change is:
  **Before**: `} name##_u initializer;`
  **After**: `} name##_u = { .obj initializer };`
  This changes how the initializer is applied. Previously, if you wanted to initialize struct members, you had to write `.obj = { .a = 0, .b = 1 }`. Now you can write directly `.a = 0, .b = 1`.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a usability improvement to the `_DEFINE_FLEX()` macro that changes how initializers are specified. It does not fix any security vulnerability.
  2. **API/Interface Change Only**: The change modifies the macro to accept a more natural C99 initialization syntax by automatically prepending `.obj` to the initializer. This is purely a syntactic convenience change.
  3. **No Runtime Impact**: The generated code and runtime behavior remain identical. The change only affects how developers write the initialization code at compile time.
  4. **Documentation/Usage Fix**: While marked as "Fixes:", this is fixing the awkward usage pattern where internal implementation details (the `.obj` member) were exposed to users of the macro. This is a design/usability fix, not a security fix.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all involve adding or modifying helper macros for flexible array handling without introducing security vulnerabilities. None of these were assigned CVEs, which aligns with this commit being a non-security change.
  The commit improves developer experience by hiding internal implementation details and providing a cleaner API, but it does not address any security vulnerability or potential for exploitation.
78b23877dbba7 kselftest/arm64: fp-ptrace: Fix expected FPMR value when PSTATE.SM is changed
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I should determine if this is a security vulnerability that requires a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a bug in a test suite (kselftest), not in the kernel itself. The commit is making changes only to `tools/testing/selftests/arm64/fp/fp-ptrace.c`, which is test code, not kernel code that runs in production systems.
  Specifically:
  1. The file path shows this is in the `tools/testing/selftests/` directory, which contains kernel self-tests
  2. The commit message clearly states "The fp-ptrace test suite expects..." and "Fix this by changing the test to expect..."
  3. The code changes only modify test expectations in the `set_initial_values()` function, removing the logic that expected FPMR to be zeroed when PSTATE.SM changes
  4. The actual kernel behavior regarding FPMR and ptrace remains unchanged - only the test's expectations are being corrected
  While the commit message references a kernel bug that was fixed in commit e5fa85fce08b ("arm64/fpsimd: Don't corrupt FPMR when streaming mode changes"), this current commit is not fixing that security issue - it's merely updating test code to match the corrected kernel behavior.
  CVEs are assigned to security vulnerabilities in software that could be exploited, not to bugs in test suites that verify kernel behavior.
59529bbe642de firmware: SDEI: Allow sdei initialization without ACPI_APEI_GHES
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a dependency refactoring and initialization ordering fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit splits `sdei_init()` into two functions (`sdei_init()` and `acpi_sdei_init()`) to allow SDEI to be initialized without requiring ACPI_APEI_GHES.
  2. **No security impact**: The changes are purely organizational:
     - Removes the hard dependency of ARM_SDE_INTERFACE on ACPI_APEI_GHES in Kconfig
     - Splits initialization into platform driver registration (via arch_initcall) and ACPI device registration
     - The functionality remains the same - SDEI still works with ACPI when available
  3. **No vulnerability fixed**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "restore flexibility and usability" by allowing SDEI to work on non-ACPI platforms. There's no mention of any security issue being fixed.
  4. **Code analysis shows no security fixes**:
     - The changes only affect initialization ordering and dependencies
     - No buffer overflow fixes, access control changes, or security-relevant modifications
     - The actual SDEI functionality and security properties remain unchanged
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This commit is similar to the example commits shown that reorganize code or fix dependencies without addressing security vulnerabilities (like the "of/fdt: Restore possibility to use both ACPI and FDT" commit).
  The commit is fixing a functional limitation introduced by a previous commit (dc4e8c07e9e2) that made SDEI too tightly coupled to ACPI/GHES, but this is not a security vulnerability.
d01ca8708d95a drm/amd/display: Don't check for NULL divisor in fixpt code
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
3c3642335065c drm/tegra: rgb: Fix the unbound reference count
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparing it with the similar commits provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a reference count leak for a device tree node (`of_node`). The commit fixes a missing `of_node_put()` call when `of_get_child_by_name()` increments the reference count but the driver doesn't decrement it during unbind.
  2. **Limited security impact**: While this is a resource leak, it only occurs during driver unbind/removal operations, which are typically administrative actions. The leak doesn't lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Denial of service under normal operation
     - Information disclosure
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 2 (drm/tegra: Fix reference leak in tegra_dsi_ganged_probe) was marked as "CVE Status: YES", but that involved `put_device()` for a platform device obtained via `of_find_device_by_node()`, which is a more significant resource leak.
     - The current commit only deals with device tree node references, which are lighter weight resources.
  4. **Scope and exploitability**: The leak only happens during module unload/driver unbind, which requires privileged access. An attacker would need to already have sufficient privileges to load/unload kernel modules, making this not a security boundary crossing issue.
  5. **Resource impact**: The leaked resource is just a device tree node reference counter, not actual memory allocation or hardware resources. The impact is minimal and would require many bind/unbind cycles to have any noticeable effect.
  This is a correctness fix for proper resource management, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
258aebf100540 drm/vkms: Adjust vkms_state->active_planes allocation type
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Brief explanation:
  1. **No Security Impact**: This is a type correctness fix that has no actual security implications. The change from `sizeof(plane)` to `sizeof(*vkms_state->active_planes)` is purely for type consistency.
  2. **Same Memory Allocation**: Since both `struct drm_plane *` and `struct vkms_plane_state *` are pointers, they have the same size on all architectures (8 bytes on 64-bit, 4 bytes on 32-bit). The actual allocated memory size remains unchanged.
  3. **No Vulnerability Fixed**: The original code worked correctly despite the type mismatch because:
     - The allocation size was correct (pointer size)
     - The array is properly accessed with bounds checking (`i < n_active_planes`)
     - No buffer overflow or memory corruption was possible
  4. **Code Quality Fix**: This is a code quality improvement to make the code more maintainable and type-safe for potential future changes where type sizes might matter. It's part of preparing for "type aware" allocators as mentioned in the commit message.
  The similar commits show that CVEs are assigned for actual security vulnerabilities like:
  - NULL pointer dereferences (commit 1)
  - Missing size validation that could cause kernel panic (commit 3)
  - Resource leaks in error paths (commit 5)
  This commit doesn't fix any such vulnerability.
91e3bf09a90bb drm: rcar-du: Fix memory leak in rcar_du_vsps_init()
- [sasha] NO
  This commit fixes a memory leak in the rcar_du_vsps_init() function where device tree node references weren't being properly released in the non-error case. However, this does not warrant a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Limited impact**: The memory leak only occurs during driver initialization (probe time), not during runtime operations. It's a one-time leak of a few device tree node structures.
  2. **No exploitability**: The leak cannot be triggered by unprivileged users or remote attackers. It only happens when the DRM driver is loaded on specific Renesas R-Car hardware.
  3. **Bounded resource consumption**: Unlike the similar commits with CVE assignments that showed unbounded memory leaks in error paths that could be triggered repeatedly (e.g., through userspace API calls), this leak is bounded and happens only once during initialization.
  4. **No security impact**: The leak cannot cause system instability, denial of service, or be leveraged for privilege escalation. It's merely a few unreleased device tree node references.
  The key difference from the CVE-assigned commits is that those involved memory leaks in paths that could be triggered repeatedly by userspace operations, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. This commit fixes a one-time initialization leak with no security implications.
5232a29ebc74d drm/msm/dpu: remove DSC feature bit for PINGPONG on MSM8953
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Configuration Error Fix, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes an incorrect hardware catalog configuration where the MSM8953 platform was incorrectly configured to have the DPU_PINGPONG_DSC feature bit set in its PINGPONG blocks.
  2. **No DSC Hardware on MSM8953**: The MSM8953 platform does not have DSC (Display Stream Compression) hardware blocks. The dpu_msm8953_cfg structure has no `dsc_count` or `dsc` fields, confirming the platform lacks DSC hardware entirely.
  3. **Incorrect Feature Advertisement**: The PINGPONG_MSM8996_MASK (which includes the DPU_PINGPONG_DSC bit) was incorrectly reused for MSM8953. When this bit is set, it enables DSC-related operations in the pingpong block (dpu_hw_pp_setup_dsc, dpu_hw_pp_dsc_enable, dpu_hw_pp_dsc_disable) that would attempt to access DSC-related registers that don't exist on MSM8953.
  4. **No Security Impact**: While this could potentially cause incorrect register accesses, there's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - Privilege escalation possibilities
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Any exploitable condition
  5. **Similar to Other Catalog Fixes**: This is similar to the other non-CVE commits shown in the examples that fix display hardware catalog misconfigurations (like commit 768a272d5357, af0a4a2090cc, 9a20f33495bf, and c59afe50773d).
  The commit simply removes an incorrectly set feature bit to properly reflect the actual hardware capabilities of the MSM8953 platform. This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
5be98120115c4 drm/msm/dpu: remove DSC feature bit for PINGPONG on MSM8917
- [sasha] Let me analyze what I've found:
  Based on my analysis of the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a hardware capability correction in a display driver catalog. The commit removes an incorrectly assigned feature bit (DPU_PINGPONG_DSC) from the MSM8917 platform configuration.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The change fixes a configuration error where DSC (Display Stream Compression) support was incorrectly declared for hardware that doesn't have DSC blocks or DSC registers. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Impact analysis**: 
     - When the DSC feature bit is set, it enables three operations: `setup_dsc`, `enable_dsc`, and `disable_dsc`
     - These operations write to DSC-related registers (PP_DSC_MODE, PP_DCE_DATA_OUT_SWAP)
     - Since MSM8917 hardware doesn't have these registers, the writes would either be ignored or could potentially cause undefined behavior, but this is a functionality issue, not a security issue
  4. **Similar commits pattern**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with similar display hardware configuration corrections (dither settings, feature masks, hardware block assignments).
  5. **Type of fix**: This is a display driver catalog correction that removes an incorrectly declared hardware feature. It doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues.
  The commit is simply correcting hardware feature declarations to match the actual hardware capabilities of the MSM8917 platform.
b43c524134e0b drm/msm/dpu: remove DSC feature bit for PINGPONG on MSM8937
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  This commit removes the DSC (Display Stream Compression) feature bit from PINGPONG blocks in the MSM8937 hardware catalog. This is a correctness fix for hardware configuration, not a security vulnerability fix:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: The commit is fixing an incorrect hardware capability declaration. MSM8937 hardware doesn't have DSC support, but the initial commit incorrectly claimed it did by including `PINGPONG_MSM8996_MASK` which contains the `DPU_PINGPONG_DSC` bit.
  2. **Hardware catalog correction**: The change only affects the hardware feature declaration in the catalog file (`dpu_1_14_msm8937.h`). It removes `.features = PINGPONG_MSM8996_MASK` from the pingpong configuration, which means the DSC-related operations (`setup_dsc`, `enable_dsc`, `disable_dsc`) won't be exposed for this hardware.
  3. **No exploitable condition**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information leak, or other security-relevant issue being fixed. The DSC operations just write to hardware registers (PP_DSC_MODE, PP_DCE_DATA_OUT_SWAP) that don't exist on MSM8937.
  4. **Similar to other catalog fixes**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (fixing SDM845, MSM8998, SDM670 catalogs) which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they're all hardware configuration corrections, not security fixes.
  The commit is a functional correctness fix to prevent accessing non-existent hardware features, but does not address any security vulnerability.
8dcccd7a156ff drm/msm/dpu: enable SmartDMA on SC8180X
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Non-security bug fix**: This is a functional correctness fix that re-enables SmartDMA feature support on the SC8180X platform. The commit message clearly states it's "Reworking of the catalog dropped the SmartDMA feature bit" - this was an accidental omission during code refactoring.
  2. **Feature enablement, not vulnerability fix**: The change simply adds the `_SDMA` suffix to existing feature masks (`VIG_SDM845_MASK_SDMA`, `DMA_SDM845_MASK_SDMA`, `DMA_CURSOR_SDM845_MASK_SDMA`), which enables the `BIT(DPU_SSPP_SMART_DMA_V2)` capability. SmartDMA is a performance optimization feature for the display processing unit.
  3. **No security impact**: SmartDMA is used to determine if certain display plane configurations can be split across multiple sub-blocks for better performance. The absence of this feature bit would only affect display performance/capabilities, not create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (removing non-existent hardware blocks, fixing hardware configuration mappings) which were correctly marked as non-CVE issues.
  The commit is a straightforward hardware capability configuration fix with no security implications.
6a2343de0b6f7 drm/msm/dpu: enable SmartDMA on SM8150
- [sasha] Now I understand what SmartDMA/multirect is. It's a feature that allows a single hardware pipe to handle multiple rectangles. Let me check what the actual commit fixing this does:
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is re-enabling a display feature (SmartDMA) that was accidentally dropped during a catalog rework. SmartDMA is a hardware feature that allows a single SSPP (Source Surface Processor Pipe) to process multiple rectangles, which is a performance/functionality optimization for the display subsystem.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only modifies feature masks from `VIG_SDM845_MASK` to `VIG_SDM845_MASK_SDMA` and similar for DMA masks. These masks control which hardware features are available for the display pipes. The SmartDMA feature enables multirect support, which is used for display composition optimization, not for any security-related functionality.
  3. **Configuration correction only**: As stated in the commit message, this is fixing a regression introduced in commit 460c410f02e4 ("drm/msm/dpu: duplicate sdm845 catalog entries") where the SmartDMA feature bit was accidentally dropped when duplicating catalog entries. This is purely a hardware configuration correction.
  4. **Similar to other catalog fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked as "CVE Status: NO"), they are all display catalog configuration fixes that correct hardware block associations, remove non-existent blocks, or fix feature configurations. None of these have security implications.
  The commit is simply restoring a display optimization feature that was unintentionally removed, with no security boundaries being affected or vulnerabilities being fixed.
797002deed034 selftests/seccomp: fix syscall_restart test for arm compat
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Test-only fix**: This is purely a fix to a test case in the kernel self-tests (`tools/testing/selftests/`). It does not modify any kernel code that runs in production systems.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only affects how a test determines which behavior to expect based on the architecture. The actual seccomp functionality and syscall restart mechanism work correctly - there's no security vulnerability being fixed.
  3. **Test logic correction**: The issue was that ARM64 devices running in 32-bit compatibility mode report their machine type as "armv8l" or "armv8b", which starts with "arm" and was incorrectly matching the test's check for native ARM32 systems. This caused the test to expect ARM32 behavior (seeing `__NR_nanosleep`) when it should expect the standard behavior (seeing `__NR_restart_syscall`).
  4. **No privilege escalation or security bypass**: The commit message and code changes show this is fixing a false test failure, not any actual security issue. The seccomp filtering and syscall restart mechanisms continue to work as designed.
  This is similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they are test improvements or fixes (like fixing test typos, changing test syscalls, or fixing test logic) rather than fixing actual kernel security vulnerabilities.
f699c66691fb7 arm64/fpsimd: Avoid warning when sve_to_fpsimd() is unused
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit is a trivial code cleanup that addresses a compiler warning. The changes are:
  1. **Build warning fix only**: The commit changes `static void` to `static inline void` for two functions (`fpsimd_to_sve()` and `sve_to_fpsimd()`) to suppress an "unused function" compiler warning when CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n.
  2. **No functional change**: The commit message explicitly states "Aside from suppressing the warning, there should be no functional change as a result of this patch." The `static inline` modifier only affects compilation - the compiler will inline the function or remove it if unused, but the behavior remains identical.
  3. **No security implications**: This is purely a compile-time change that affects neither runtime behavior nor any security-related functionality. The functions already had runtime checks (`if (!system_supports_sve() && !system_supports_sme()) return;`) that handle the CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n case.
  4. **Result of previous refactoring**: The warning arose because commit 929fa99b1215 removed `fpsimd_signal_preserve_current_state()`, which was the only caller of `sve_to_fpsimd()` when CONFIG_ARM64_SVE=n. This left the function unused in certain configurations, triggering the compiler warning.
  This is a typical maintenance patch that cleans up compiler warnings without any security ramifications or functional changes that could introduce vulnerabilities.
f101c56447717 arm64: Support ARM64_VA_BITS=52 when setting ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MAX
- [sasha] Let me analyze what the commit is actually fixing. Based on the code changes and commit message:
  1. The issue: When ARM64_VA_BITS=52 was introduced, the ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MAX configuration was not updated to account for it.
  2. The effect: With ARM64_VA_BITS=52, ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MAX would default to 18 bits (the fallback value at the end of the config).
  3. The fix: Update the config to treat ARM64_VA_BITS=52 the same as ARM64_VA_BITS=48 for determining ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MAX.
  The code changes show:
  - Lines 336-338 are updated from checking only `ARM64_VA_BITS=48` to checking `(ARM64_VA_BITS=48 || ARM64_VA_BITS=52)`
  - This ensures that 52-bit VA configurations get the same higher randomization bit limits as 48-bit configurations (29, 31, or 33 bits depending on page size) instead of falling back to the default lower values (14, 16, or 18 bits).
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. While it fixes a configuration issue that resulted in reduced ASLR entropy for mmap allocations when ARM64_VA_BITS=52 is configured, this is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It's a hardening feature reduction, not an exploitable vulnerability - the system still has functional ASLR with 18 bits of randomization
  2. The issue only affects systems specifically configured with ARM64_VA_BITS=52, which is not a default configuration
  3. The reduced entropy (from ~29-33 bits to 18 bits) still provides meaningful randomization
  4. This is similar to the other analyzed commits that adjust ASLR configuration parameters without introducing actual vulnerabilities
  The commit improves security hardening by increasing ASLR entropy to the intended levels, but the previous state was not vulnerable - just suboptimal.
7ff37d29fd5c2 firmware: psci: Fix refcount leak in psci_dt_init
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparing with the similar commits provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Boot-time only impact**: The `psci_dt_init()` function is marked with `__init`, meaning it only runs once during kernel boot initialization. There's no runtime exploitation vector.
  2. **Limited security impact**: Unlike commits marked as CVE-worthy (e.g., power/reset driver, regulator driver, SOC PM driver), this is purely a reference count leak during initialization failure path with no security consequences:
     - No memory corruption potential
     - No privilege escalation possibility
     - No denial of service impact
     - No information disclosure risk
  3. **Failure path only**: The leak only occurs when the PSCI node exists but is marked as unavailable (`!of_device_is_available(np)`), which is an uncommon boot configuration scenario.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: PSCI (Power State Coordination Interface) is a firmware interface for CPU power management. A reference count leak during its one-time initialization cannot be leveraged by an attacker to compromise the system.
  5. **Pattern analysis**: Looking at the CVE-assigned similar commits, they involve drivers that:
     - Handle runtime operations (power reset, regulators)
     - Manage hardware resources that could affect system stability
     - Have potential for resource exhaustion through repeated operations
  This PSCI initialization leak lacks these characteristics - it's a one-time boot leak in a rarely-hit error path with no security ramifications.
52ae3f5da7e5a m68k: mac: Fix macintosh_config for Mac II
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze what happens:
  1. The `mac_data_table` array starts with index 0, which is a catch-all "Unknown" entry
  2. Index 1 contains the actual Mac II entry (with ident = MAC_MODEL_II = 6)
  3. The old code started the search at `macintosh_config = mac_data_table` (index 0)
  4. When searching for model ID 6, it would incorrectly match against the catch-all entry at index 0 (which also has ident = MAC_MODEL_II = 6)
  The fix changes the loop to start at `&mac_data_table[1]`, skipping the catch-all entry and ensuring the correct Mac II entry is found.
  **NO**
  This is not a security vulnerability. This is a cosmetic bug that causes incorrect model identification output ("Apple Macintosh Unknown" instead of "Apple Macintosh II"). The bug only affects the display string shown during boot and does not impact:
  - Memory safety
  - Access control
  - System security boundaries
  - Data integrity
  - Any exploitable condition
  The off-by-one error simply causes the wrong descriptive name to be selected from the configuration table, which is purely informational and has no security implications.
8e28276a569ad watchdog: exar: Shorten identity name to fit correctly
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a compile-time warning fix for a string that is too long (33 bytes including NUL) for a 32-byte array. The issue is purely cosmetic and relates to compiler warnings, not a runtime security vulnerability.
  2. **No Information Disclosure**: The identity field is properly bounded at 32 bytes by the UAPI structure definition. When the string was 33 bytes with NUL terminator, the compiler would truncate it to 32 bytes without the NUL terminator. The watchdog core properly handles this when copying to userspace via `copy_to_user()` which respects the structure size.
  3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (like the tipc bearer name validation), this commit doesn't involve:
     - Uninitialized memory reads
     - Buffer overflows
     - Input validation failures
     - Race conditions
     - Access control bypasses
  4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: The commit is similar to other non-CVE fixes like the "fs/qnx6" and "clkdev" commits that address compiler warnings about string initialization but don't pose security risks.
  5. **Build Warning Only**: The issue only causes a build warning with GCC 15's `-Wunterminated-string-initialization` option and doesn't affect the runtime behavior or security of the system.
  The fix simply shortens "Exar/MaxLinear XR28V38x Watchdog" to "Exar XR28V38x Watchdog" to fit within the 32-byte limit including the NUL terminator, preventing the compiler warning.
0d6efa20e384a kunit/usercopy: Disable u64 test on 32-bit SPARC
- [sasha] ## Analysis and Conclusion
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a test fix that disables a failing unit test on 32-bit SPARC architecture. Here's why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Test-only change**: The commit only modifies test code (`lib/tests/usercopy_kunit.c`), not any actual kernel functionality. It simply adds `CONFIG_SPARC32` to the list of architectures that don't support 64-bit get_user() operations.
  2. **Known architecture limitation**: The issue is that 32-bit SPARC's get_user() implementation uses `unsigned long` (32-bit on SPARC32) to store the retrieved value, so it can only properly handle up to 32-bit values. When attempting to get a 64-bit value, it truncates to 32 bits.
  3. **No security impact**: This is an architectural limitation, not a security bug. The get_user() function still performs all necessary access checks and returns data - it just can't handle 64-bit values on this architecture. There's no memory corruption, no privilege escalation, and no information disclosure beyond what was already accessible.
  4. **Similar to other architectures**: The test already excludes several other 32-bit architectures (M68K, MICROBLAZE, NIOS2, PPC32, etc.) that have the same limitation. SPARC32 is just being added to this existing list.
  5. **Test discovered expected behavior**: The failing test actually demonstrates that SPARC32's get_user() is working as designed for that architecture - it successfully reads 32 bits of the 64-bit value. This is consistent with the architecture's register size limitations.
  The commit is simply acknowledging that SPARC32, like several other 32-bit architectures, doesn't support 64-bit get_user() operations and adjusting the test suite accordingly.
8b26c8c376b29 fs/ntfs3: Add missing direct_IO in ntfs_aops_cmpr
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual issue. The commit adds `direct_IO` to `ntfs_aops_cmpr`. Looking at the code:
  1. The commit b432163ebd15 allowed switching between `ntfs_aops` and `ntfs_aops_cmpr` based on compression state
  2. `ntfs_aops` has `.direct_IO = ntfs_direct_IO`
  3. `ntfs_aops_cmpr` was missing `.direct_IO`
  The new code in this commit adds a check for compressed files in `ntfs_direct_IO`:
  ```c
  if (is_compressed(ni)) {
      ret = 0;
      goto out;
  }
  ```
  This prevents direct I/O on compressed files. Without this check and without the `.direct_IO` handler in `ntfs_aops_cmpr`, the kernel could potentially crash or misbehave when trying to do direct I/O on compressed NTFS files.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional issue where the `ntfs_aops_cmpr` address space operations structure was missing the `.direct_IO` callback. While this could potentially cause crashes when attempting direct I/O operations on compressed NTFS files, this is a standard bug fix for incomplete/incorrect data structure initialization rather than a security vulnerability.
  The fix properly handles compressed files by:
  1. Adding the missing `.direct_IO` callback to `ntfs_aops_cmpr`
  2. Making `ntfs_direct_IO` return early (with ret=0) for compressed files
  This is similar to other commits in the reference set that fix NTFS3 compression-related bugs without being assigned CVEs. The issue doesn't involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-critical aspects - it's simply ensuring proper operation fallback for compressed files.
af5cab0e5b6f8 fs/ntfs3: handle hdr_first_de() return value
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security impact. Looking at the code changes, the commit adds NULL pointer checks after `hdr_first_de()` calls. The function `hdr_first_de()` can return NULL in several cases:
  1. When `de_off >= used`
  2. When `size_add(de_off, sizeof(struct NTFS_DE)) > used`
  3. When entry size validation fails
  The commit adds two NULL checks:
  1. After `e = hdr_first_de(&n->index->ihdr);` at line 2183
  2. After `te = hdr_first_de(&n->index->ihdr);` at line 2205
  Without these checks, the code would dereference NULL pointers:
  - In the first case, `e` is passed to `de_is_last(e)` and `de_has_vcn(e)` 
  - In the second case, `te` is dereferenced with `le16_to_cpu(te->size)`
  This is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that could lead to a kernel crash/DoS when processing a malformed NTFS filesystem image.
  Comparing to the similar commits provided:
  - Similar Commit 1 & 3: Integer overflow prevention in hdr_first_de() - CVE assigned
  - Similar Commit 2 & 4: NULL pointer check for 'folio' pointer - CVE assigned  
  - Similar Commit 5: NULL pointer check at the end of attr_allocate_frame() - CVE assigned
  All the similar commits that added NULL pointer checks or fixed integer overflows were assigned CVEs.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. It fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the NTFS3 filesystem driver. The vulnerability occurs when `hdr_first_de()` returns NULL due to malformed NTFS filesystem data, and the code subsequently dereferences the NULL pointer without checking. This could allow a local attacker with the ability to mount a crafted NTFS filesystem to cause a kernel crash (denial of service). The fix adds proper NULL checks after calls to `hdr_first_de()`, which is consistent with the pattern of CVE assignments for similar NULL pointer dereference fixes in the NTFS3 driver.
a22e0051f9eb2 drm/v3d: client ranges from axi_ids are different with V3D 7.1
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual code changes in the commit we're evaluating:
  Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is fixing a diagnostic/debugging issue where MMU error messages would display incorrect client names for V3D 7.1 hardware. The code changes show:
     - Addition of a new `v3d71_axi_ids[]` array with correct client ID ranges for V3D 7.1
     - Modification of the client ID lookup logic to use the appropriate array based on hardware version
     - The masking change from `axi_id & 0xFF` to `axi_id & 0x7F` for V3D 7.1
  2. **No exploitable condition**: The original code would simply display the wrong client name (or "?") in error messages when an MMU fault occurred. This is purely informational output in `dev_err()` messages and doesn't affect any security boundaries or access controls.
  3. **No bounds checking issue**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (commit 6ce9efd12ae8 and f32b5128d2c4), this commit doesn't fix any out-of-bounds access. The ID lookup is done safely within fixed arrays using range comparisons.
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: The commits that received CVEs in the similar list were fixing actual security vulnerabilities:
     - Commit 6ce9efd12ae8: Fixed missing bounds check on user input that could lead to kernel memory corruption
     - Commit f32b5128d2c4: Same bounds checking issue with performance query extensions
  This commit is a functional fix for incorrect diagnostic output on newer hardware, not a security vulnerability fix.
d0e4c6537005d drm/v3d: fix client obtained from axi_ids on V3D 4.1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to determine if this is a security vulnerability:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes an incorrect calculation when determining which client caused an MMU error in the V3D graphics driver. The key aspects are:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a diagnostic/debugging issue. The bug only affects error reporting - it displays the wrong client name when an MMU error occurs ("MMU error from client ? (13)" instead of the correct client name).
  2. **No security impact**: The incorrect client identification doesn't:
     - Allow unauthorized memory access
     - Bypass security controls
     - Cause crashes or denial of service
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Enable privilege escalation
  3. **Pure diagnostic fix**: The change only fixes how the axi_id is decoded to identify the correct client:
     - Old code: `axi_id = axi_id >> 5` (incorrect bit shifting)
     - New code: `axi_id = axi_id & 0xFF` (correct masking to get bits 0-7)
     - Then uses proper range checking instead of array indexing
  4. **Error already detected**: The MMU error itself is already properly detected and handled. This fix only improves the diagnostic message to correctly identify which hardware unit (L2T, PTB, PSE, TLB, CLE, TFU, MMU, or GMP) triggered the error.
  This is similar to the "Similar Commit 2" which also received "CVE Status: NO" - it's a functional fix that improves driver behavior but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
76dbd0973c555 drm/v3d: Associate a V3D tech revision to all supported devices
- [sasha] Let me look at the similar commits from my reference:
  Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This is a refactoring/enhancement commit that associates V3D tech revisions with device data. It does not fix any security vulnerability but rather improves the driver's ability to identify GPU versions before powering on.
  2. **Architecture Improvement**: The changes introduce an enum `v3d_gen` to better track V3D generations and add device tree data associations. This is a design improvement to support V3D 7.1's new power-on requirements.
  3. **Defensive Programming**: The added `WARN_ON(v3d->ver != gen)` is a sanity check to ensure consistency between hardware-reported version and device tree data - this is defensive programming, not a security fix.
  4. **No Exploitable Condition**: The code changes don't address any condition that could be exploited for:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Access control bypass
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern of driver improvements and refactoring without security implications.
  The commit is purely a functional enhancement to support newer hardware (V3D 7.1) by enabling the driver to know the GPU version before power-on, which is required for proper initialization of newer hardware revisions.
b848cd418aebd drm/bridge: lt9611uxc: Fix an error handling path in lt9611uxc_probe()
- [sasha] Let me examine the commit more carefully based on the code changes provided:
  Looking at the code changes:
  1. The commit modifies the error handling in `lt9611uxc_probe()` 
  2. Before the fix, if `lt9611uxc_audio_init()` failed, it would return directly without proper cleanup
  3. After the fix, it properly goes through the error handling path (`err_remove_bridge`) which:
     - Frees the IRQ
     - Cancels work
     - Removes the DRM bridge
     - Disables regulators
     - Releases device tree node references
  This is a **resource leak** fix, not a security vulnerability. The impact is:
  - If audio initialization fails, some resources (IRQ, regulators, device references) would not be properly released
  - This could lead to resource exhaustion over time if the driver probe is retried multiple times
  - However, this is not exploitable by an attacker - it's just a cleanup issue during error conditions
  Similar to the other commits shown as examples (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this is a straightforward error handling fix that ensures proper cleanup of resources when initialization fails.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a resource leak in an error handling path during driver probe, which is a quality/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The leak only occurs when `lt9611uxc_audio_init()` fails during probe, and the resources that would be leaked (IRQ, regulators, device references) do not pose a security risk. This is consistent with similar error handling fixes in the provided examples that were marked as not requiring CVEs.
e1eb7293ab410 drm/panel: samsung-sofef00: Drop s6e3fc2x01 support
- [sasha] Let me analyze the changes described in the commit:
  Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit drops support for a specific panel variant (s6e3fc2x01) that was using an incorrect initialization sequence. The commit message states "We never properly supported this panel and always used the wrong init sequence." This is a functionality/compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Hardware-Specific Code**: The changes are in a display panel driver that controls hardware initialization sequences. Using the wrong initialization sequence for a panel might cause display issues or hardware malfunction, but does not create a security vulnerability that could be exploited.
  3. **No Attack Surface**: The code changes show:
     - Removal of `fajita_panel_mode` structure (lines 162-174 in diff)
     - Simplification of `sofef00_panel_get_modes()` to use only `enchilada_panel_mode`
     - Removal of the `mode` field from `sofef00_panel` struct
     - Removal of device-specific mode selection logic in probe function
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, all of them have "CVE Status: NO". They involve:
     - Adding error checking for panel orientation
     - Correcting device property API usage
     - Adding missing error handling
     - Setting panel flags
     
     None of these were considered security issues worthy of CVEs.
  5. **Maintenance/Cleanup Change**: This is a maintenance change to remove incorrectly implemented support for a hardware variant, allowing for a proper driver implementation later. It's essentially cleaning up technical debt rather than fixing a security issue.
  The commit fixes a "Fixes:" reference indicating it's addressing an issue from the original implementation, but the issue is about incorrect hardware support, not a security vulnerability.
d30f61076268f drm/amdgpu: Refine Cleaner Shader MEC firmware version for GFX10.1.x GPUs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if changing the minimum MEC firmware version from 152 to 151 represents a security vulnerability.
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is adjusting a version check threshold, not fixing an actual security vulnerability. It's lowering the minimum required MEC firmware version from 152 to 151 to enable the cleaner shader feature on more hardware.
  2. **Enabling a security feature on more hardware**: The cleaner shader itself is a security enhancement that clears GPU resources (VGPRs, SGPRs, LDS) between workloads to prevent data leaks. This commit makes that security feature available to GPUs with MEC firmware version 151 instead of requiring version 152.
  3. **No vulnerability being introduced or fixed**: The change doesn't fix a security issue - it's expanding compatibility for an existing security feature. The commit message explicitly states it's for "broader compatibility with GFX10.1 GPUs."
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that simply add or enable cleaner shader support for different GPU models (like "drm/amdgpu/gfx9: Add cleaner shader for GFX9.4.2") were marked as "CVE Status: NO". This commit follows the same pattern of enabling/adjusting cleaner shader support rather than fixing a vulnerability.
  5. **Version threshold adjustment**: The change from 152 to 151 appears to be a refinement based on testing or validation that determined version 151 is sufficient for the cleaner shader functionality to work correctly.
  The cleaner shader feature itself enhances security by preventing data leaks between GPU workloads, but adjusting the minimum firmware version requirement to enable it on more hardware is not fixing a vulnerability - it's expanding the availability of a security feature.
fc5106088d6db perf: arm-ni: Fix missing platform_set_drvdata()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can be triggered during device removal. The issue is:
  1. **Missing platform_set_drvdata()**: The probe function allocates and initializes the `arm_ni` structure but fails to call `platform_set_drvdata()` to associate it with the platform device.
  2. **NULL pointer dereference in remove()**: When `arm_ni_remove()` is called, it calls `platform_get_drvdata(pdev)` which returns NULL since the drvdata was never set. The code then immediately dereferences this NULL pointer at line 672: `for (int i = 0; i < ni->num_cds; i++)`, attempting to access `ni->num_cds`.
  3. **Triggerable condition**: This can be triggered by removing the device (unbinding the driver, module removal, or device hotplug removal), which would cause a kernel crash.
  This matches the pattern of the similar CVE commits shown, particularly commits 3 and 5 which also fixed NULL pointer dereferences caused by missing platform_set_drvdata() calls in probe functions that led to crashes in remove/suspend/resume paths.
7f57afde6a44d perf: arm-ni: Unregister PMUs on probe failure
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit without the kernel tree access. Based on the provided information:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability that causes a kernel panic. Here's why it should be assigned a CVE:
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug causes a kernel panic with a list corruption error ("list_add corruption: next->prev should be prev"), which can lead to system crashes and potential denial of service.
  2. **Root Cause**: The issue occurs when resource allocation fails during probe in one clock domain. The driver fails to properly unregister previously registered PMUs in other clock domains, leaving corrupted kernel data structures.
  3. **Exploitation Vector**: The vulnerability can be triggered during driver probe when resource allocation fails (e.g., "Failed to request PMU region 0x1f3c13000"). This could potentially be triggered by resource exhaustion or conflicting resource allocations.
  4. **Code Fix**: The patch adds proper error handling by:
     - Moving the `arm_ni_remove()` function earlier in the code
     - Calling `arm_ni_remove()` to clean up all previously registered PMUs when `arm_ni_init_cd()` fails
     - Setting `ni->cds[cd.id].pmu_base = NULL` before cleanup to ensure proper state
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - "perf: hisi: Fix use-after-free when register pmu fails" was assigned a CVE for a similar PMU registration failure causing use-after-free
     - "pmdomain: arm: Fix NULL dereference on scmi_perf_domain removal" was assigned a CVE for improper cleanup causing NULL dereference
  This vulnerability follows the same pattern of improper cleanup during driver initialization/removal leading to kernel crashes, which has historically been assigned CVEs in the Linux kernel.
938aaed555f3a drm/panthor: Fix the panthor_gpu_coherency_init() error path
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change fixes an incorrect error path in the device initialization sequence. When `panthor_gpu_coherency_init()` fails, the original code returned directly without proper cleanup, which would leak resources allocated by `panthor_gpu_init()` including:
  - DMA configuration (dma_set_mask_and_coherent)
  - IRQ handler registration (panthor_request_gpu_irq)
  - GPU memory allocations (drmm_kzalloc)
  - PM runtime reference count
  However, this is a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability because:
  1. It only occurs during device initialization failure, not during normal operation
  2. Requires specific hardware conditions (coherent system where GPU doesn't support ACE-Lite protocol)
  3. No memory corruption or privilege escalation possible
  4. No sensitive data exposure
  5. Limited to resource leaks that would require driver reload attempts to potentially cause resource exhaustion
  The fix correctly changes the error path from `return ret;` to `goto err_unplug_gpu;` which ensures proper cleanup by calling `panthor_gpu_unplug()` and releasing the PM runtime reference.
6c161732ea646 accel/amdxdna: Fix incorrect size of ERT_START_NPU commands
- [sasha] Let me analyze the security implications based on what I can see:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**: The incorrect size calculation in `aie2_cmdlist_fill_one_slot_dpu()` used `*size +=` instead of `*size =`, which means when multiple ERT_START_NPU commands are combined, the size accumulates incorrectly. This could lead to writing beyond the allocated 4K buffer (MAX_CHAIN_CMDBUF_SIZE).
  2. **Incorrect Bounds Check**: The old macros `slot_cf_has_space()` and `slot_dpu_has_space()` had an incorrect condition that could allow buffer overflows:
     - Old: `(MAX_CHAIN_CMDBUF_SIZE - ((offset) + (payload_size)) > offsetof(struct cmd_chain_slot_*, args[0]))`
     - New: `(MAX_CHAIN_CMDBUF_SIZE >= (offset) + (payload_size) + sizeof(typeof(slot)))`
     
     The old check was comparing against the wrong value and could allow writes beyond the buffer boundary.
  3. **Memory Corruption Risk**: In the loop at line 665-685, multiple commands are processed and their sizes accumulated. With the incorrect `+=` operator, each iteration would add the full size instead of just setting it, potentially causing the `offset` to grow beyond the buffer bounds and corrupt adjacent memory when `memcpy()` is called at line 533/569.
  4. **User-Controlled Input**: The commands come from user space through the IOCTL interface, making this exploitable by unprivileged users who can submit malicious command chains.
  This is similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the reference examples that fixed buffer overflow issues (like the drm/amd/display commits that fixed OVERRUN issues with incorrect size calculations).
8ba64cf2f3580 drm/panthor: Update panthor_mmu::irq::mask when needed
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the fix:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Bug impact is limited to functionality, not security**: The bug causes the IRQ handler to not be called again after clearing faulty bits because `panthor_mmu::irq::mask` is not updated. This results in missing fault notifications rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The code change shows that when clearing the faulty mask bits in `panthor_vm_active()`, the driver also needs to update `ptdev->mmu->irq.mask` to re-enable interrupt handling for that address space. Without this fix, subsequent page faults on that AS would not generate interrupts, but this doesn't lead to unauthorized access or information disclosure.
  3. **Driver reliability issue**: The impact is that the GPU MMU fault handling becomes unreliable after the first fault on an address space. This is a functional bug that affects driver reliability, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix driver synchronization issues, locking problems, or interrupt handling without security implications are marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The fix simply ensures that when faulty bits are cleared and interrupts are re-enabled for an address space, the cached interrupt mask (`ptdev->mmu->irq.mask`) is also updated to match the hardware state. This is a correctness fix for proper interrupt handling, not a security fix.
7d5a3b22f5b58 drm/panthor: Call panthor_gpu_coherency_init() after PM resume()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a real bug where registers are accessed before the device is powered on, this is primarily a driver initialization/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability. The bug can cause system crashes or incorrect driver configuration, but:
  1. **Limited attack surface**: The issue occurs only during driver initialization, not during normal operation
  2. **Requires privileged access**: Triggering the probe path typically requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or module loading privileges
  3. **Platform-specific impact**: Many platforms handle unpowered MMIO reads gracefully without crashing
  4. **No data exposure**: There's no information disclosure or privilege escalation risk
  5. **Similar commits precedent**: The similar commits provided (panthor race fixes, AST resume fix) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" despite fixing crashes/hangs
  The fix properly moves the coherency check to after PM resume, ensuring the hardware is powered when accessed. This follows standard driver initialization patterns and addresses a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability.
d1df2907fb69d drm/panthor: Fix GPU_COHERENCY_ACE[_LITE] definitions
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a simple definition swap that fixes incorrect constant values. The bug causes the driver to write the wrong bit pattern to the GPU_COHERENCY_PROTOCOL register (writing bit 1 instead of bit 0 for ACE_LITE mode).
  2. **Limited Impact**: 
     - The code only uses ACE_LITE mode (never ACE mode), so only one code path is affected
     - The incorrect value (2 instead of 1) being written to the coherency protocol register would likely cause incorrect coherency behavior but not a security vulnerability
     - This is a functional correctness issue, not a security issue
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: 
     - The bug doesn't create memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure opportunities
     - It's a hardware configuration error that would affect GPU coherency behavior
     - There's no user-controllable input that could exploit this bug
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This commit is similar to the "CS_STATUS_ defines update" and "register definition order fix" examples that were marked as NO CVE - they're all simple definition/constant fixes without security implications.
  The commit simply corrects register definition values to match the hardware specification, which is a bug fix but not a security vulnerability.
c94f2f326146a arm64/fpsimd: Fix merging of FPSIMD state during signal return
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug affects the merging of FPSIMD state during signal return, but this only impacts the process's own register state. The commit message explicitly states that the problem is with restoring the process's own SVE/FPSIMD state when returning from a signal handler.
  2. **No privilege escalation or information disclosure**: The issue is about incorrect merging of the lower 128 bits of SVE registers from the FPSIMD signal frame. This affects the correctness of the program's execution but doesn't allow:
     - Access to other processes' data
     - Kernel memory access
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure across security boundaries
  3. **Self-contained impact**: The change in `fpsimd_update_current_state()` from checking `test_thread_flag(TIF_SVE)` to checking `current->thread.fp_type == FP_STATE_SVE` only affects how the current process's own register state is restored. The function explicitly operates on "current" task's state.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: The provided similar commits that track FP state (commits 1-5) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO", and they deal with similar floating-point state management issues. This commit follows the same pattern of fixing register state handling without security implications.
  5. **Functional correctness issue**: The bug causes non-deterministic behavior in register state restoration ("the merging may occur non-deterministically from the perspective of userspace"), which is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The commit fixes a bug that could cause incorrect program behavior but does not create any security vulnerabilities that would warrant a CVE assignment.
a90878f297d3d arm64/fpsimd: Reset FPMR upon exec()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Limited Information Disclosure Risk**: While FPMR (Floating Point Mode Register) state is erroneously inherited across exec(), this represents a minimal security risk. FPMR is a configuration register for FP8 (8-bit floating-point) operations, not a register containing sensitive data or secrets.
  2. **Configuration State vs. Sensitive Data**: The code shows FPMR is used to configure floating-point behavior (`write_sysreg_s(current->thread.uw.fpmr, SYS_FPMR)`). Unlike the CVE-worthy commit in the similar examples that dealt with floating-point register values containing actual computation data, FPMR is just a mode/configuration register.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation**: The bug doesn't enable privilege escalation, memory corruption, or access to kernel memory. It's simply a failure to reset a configuration register during exec().
  4. **Comparison with CVE-worthy Similar Commit**: The CVE-assigned commit "KVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state" addressed multiple serious issues including data corruption and unintentional ptrace ABI changes that could expose sensitive floating-point computation data. In contrast, this commit only fixes inheritance of a configuration register.
  5. **No Data Leakage**: The commit that was assigned a CVE (0abdeff598a6) involved actual floating-point register data being leaked between tasks, which could contain sensitive computational results. FPMR is just a mode register that doesn't contain user data.
  The fix is a correctness issue that ensures proper initialization after exec(), but it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
01098d893fa8a arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the actual security impact. Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security-critical state corruption**: The bug causes kernel FPSIMD state to be clobbered (zeroed) during context switches. This state is actively used by cryptographic operations in the kernel, as evidenced by the extensive use of `kernel_neon_begin()` in 21 crypto files including AES, SHA, ChaCha20, and other security-critical algorithms.
  2. **Concrete attack vector**: When a thread uses kernel NEON (e.g., for crypto operations), its FPSIMD state can be corrupted if:
     - The CPU is in streaming SVE mode during context switch
     - The thread had TIF_KERNEL_FPSTATE set (from kernel_neon_begin)
     - The SMSTOP instruction zeros all FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers after the state was loaded
  3. **Security implications**:
     - **Cryptographic failures**: Zeroing FPSIMD registers in the middle of crypto operations could cause incorrect encryption/decryption results, potentially exposing data
     - **Authentication bypass**: MAC/signature verification could fail or pass incorrectly
     - **Key material exposure**: Partial cryptographic state could be leaked through timing or error handling
  4. **Real-world impact**: This affects production ARM64 systems with SME support running kernel crypto, which includes modern ARM servers and high-end processors.
  5. **Clear fix**: The commit shows the bug is in ordering - `fpsimd_flush_cpu_state()` (which calls SMSTOP) must happen BEFORE loading kernel FPSIMD state, not after.
  The commit message explicitly states "the hardware to reset a number of FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state" which confirms register corruption occurs. This is a classic security vulnerability where critical kernel state is corrupted in a way that could be exploited.
e5fa85fce08b2 arm64/fpsimd: Don't corrupt FPMR when streaming mode changes
- [sasha] Now let me analyze what this commit fixes. Looking at the commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a register state corruption issue that occurs during streaming mode transitions in ARM64 processors with specific features (FEAT_FPMR and SME). The bug causes the FPMR (Floating-Point Mode Register) value to be incorrectly clobbered when transitioning between streaming modes.
  2. **Impact analysis**:
     - The bug corrupts the FPMR register value when PSTATE.SM changes (streaming mode transitions)
     - This affects floating-point operations behavior but does not lead to:
       - Memory corruption
       - Privilege escalation
       - Information disclosure across security boundaries
       - System crashes or denial of service
  3. **Code analysis**: The fix simply reorders operations in `task_fpsimd_load()`:
     ```c
     // Before: FPMR was restored here (line 362-363)
     // After: FPMR is restored here (line 416-417), after SVCR write
     ```
     The write to SVCR (line 406) can change PSTATE.SM, which causes hardware to automatically reset FPMR to 0, clobbering the previously restored value.
  4. **Security implications**: While this is a correctness bug that could affect application behavior using floating-point operations with specific ARM64 features, it doesn't cross security boundaries or enable attacks. Applications would see incorrect floating-point behavior but cannot exploit this for malicious purposes.
  The similar commits analyzed (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show that floating-point state management bugs in this subsystem are generally not assigned CVEs unless they involve security boundary violations or enable exploitation.
d3eaab3c70905 arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and comparison with the referenced similar commits, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes a race condition that allows stale CPU state to be reused with SME traps enabled. This can lead to:
     - Tasks executing with incorrect floating-point/vector register state
     - Potential information disclosure if stale state from another process is exposed
     - System instability through unexpected WARN_ON triggers
  2. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The commit explicitly references that this is "very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit 751ecf6afd6568ad". Looking at the historical similar commits provided, both SVE commits with identical fixes were assigned CVEs (both marked as "CVE Status: YES").
  3. **Race Condition Details**: The race occurs when:
     - A task traps on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear
     - Gets preempted and migrated to CPU 1 (TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE set)
     - Returns to CPU 0 where the per-cpu fpsimd_last_state still points to this task
     - The stale hardware state is reused incorrectly
  4. **The Fix**: The addition of `fpsimd_flush_task_state(current)` in the else clause ensures the task is properly detached from the saved CPU state, preventing the reuse of stale state. This is the same fix pattern used in the SVE case.
  5. **Observable Impact**: The commit message mentions this can result in "warnings from do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set", indicating this is an exploitable condition that affects system behavior.
  The security implications of incorrect floating-point/vector state handling, combined with the CVE precedent for the identical SVE issue, strongly support assigning a CVE to this fix.
95507570fb2f7 arm64/fpsimd: Avoid RES0 bits in the SME trap handler
- [sasha] Let me work with the information I have. Based on the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a **future-proofing fix**, not a vulnerability fix. The commit message explicitly states: "This may break in future when those RES0 bits are allocated a meaning and stop reading as zero."
  2. **No Current Security Impact**: The code currently works correctly because RES0 (reserved, reads as zero) bits are indeed reading as zero as per the ARM architecture specification. The fix is preemptive to ensure the code continues to work correctly if/when these bits are allocated meaning in future ARM architecture revisions.
  3. **Code Analysis**: 
     - The original code: `ESR_ELx_ISS(esr) != ESR_ELx_SME_ISS_SME_DISABLED` was comparing the entire ISS field (bits [24:0]) against a value of 0
     - The new code: `ESR_ELx_SME_ISS_SMTC(esr) != ESR_ELx_SME_ISS_SMTC_SME_DISABLED` properly extracts only the SMTC field (bits [2:0]) before comparison
     - Since bits [24:3] are currently RES0, both comparisons yield the same result today
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Patterns**: This follows the pattern of commits in the historical examples that were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - particularly those that are architectural compliance fixes or future-proofing changes rather than fixing actual vulnerabilities.
  5. **No Exploitable Condition**: There is no current exploitable condition, memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. The code functions correctly today and this change ensures it will continue to function correctly with future hardware.
  This is a good engineering practice to mask off reserved bits rather than depending on their current values, but it does not fix a security vulnerability.
f270005b99fa1 media: rkvdec: Fix frame size enumeration
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It's a functionality bug fix that corrects how the rkvdec driver reports its frame size capabilities to userspace.
  The key evidence:
  1. The bug only affects the VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES ioctl, which reports capabilities but doesn't control actual frame processing
  2. The actual frame size validation in `rkvdec_try_output_fmt()` and `rkvdec_try_capture_fmt()` still uses `v4l2_apply_frmsize_constraints()` with the correct constraints
  3. Even if userspace believes it can use 1x1 frames due to the incorrect reporting, any attempt to set such sizes will be properly clamped to the minimum 48x48 and aligned to 16-pixel boundaries
  4. Buffer allocation calculations remain correct since they use the already-validated dimensions
  This is purely a capability reporting issue that could confuse userspace applications but cannot lead to memory corruption, buffer overflows, or other security issues.
820116a39f96b drm/amd/pp: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this commit should be assigned a CVE. Let me summarize the key findings:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Security Impact**: The code dereferences `vram_info` pointer without checking if `smu_atom_get_data_table()` returned NULL (lines 147-153 and 184-190 in the original vulnerable code). This can lead to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, potentially causing a system crash or denial of service.
  2. **Trigger Conditions**: The vulnerability can be triggered when:
     - The VRAM_Info table is missing from the BIOS
     - The BIOS data is corrupted or malformed
     - `amdgpu_atom_parse_data_header()` fails inside `smu_atom_get_data_table()`
  3. **Attack Vector**: While this requires specific hardware conditions or a malformed BIOS, it could potentially be exploited through:
     - Modified/corrupted BIOS firmware
     - Hardware fault injection
     - Virtualization scenarios where BIOS tables might be controlled by a hypervisor
  4. **Vulnerability Pattern**: This matches the pattern of similar CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples:
     - Similar NULL pointer dereference after `smu_atom_get_data_table()` calls
     - Affects AMD GPU driver powerplay subsystem
     - Can cause kernel crashes leading to DoS
  5. **Execution Context**: The vulnerable code is called during driver initialization through the path:
     - `smu7_enable_dpm_tasks()` → `smum_initialize_mc_reg_table()` → `atomctrl_initialize_mc_reg_table()`
     
     This happens during GPU power management initialization, which is a privileged kernel operation.
  The fix properly adds NULL checks after the `smu_atom_get_data_table()` calls, preventing the potential NULL pointer dereference. This is consistent with the security fixes in the similar commits that were assigned CVEs.
d5be7722d1736 drm/vc4: tests: Retry pv-muxing tests when EDEADLK
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes are exclusively fixing test infrastructure in the VC4 DRM driver's KUnit tests by adding proper EDEADLK retry logic. These are:
  1. **Test-only changes**: The modified file is in `drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/tests/` and only compiled when `CONFIG_DRM_VC4_KUNIT_TEST` is enabled, which is explicitly marked as "not useful for distributions or general kernels"
  2. **Expected behavior**: EDEADLK is a legitimate return value in DRM's wait-wound mutex locking system, not an error condition. The fix adds standard retry logic (`drm_atomic_state_clear()` + `drm_modeset_backoff()`) that production code already uses
  3. **No security impact**: The missing retry logic only caused spurious test failures when lock contention occurred. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant impact
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (fixing test infrastructure, adding missing error handling in tests, etc.) which were all marked "CVE Status: NO"
  The commit is improving test reliability by handling a legitimate locking scenario properly, not fixing a security vulnerability.
7e0351ae91ed2 drm/vc4: tests: Stop allocating the state in test init
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Test code only**: This is a fix for unit test code (kunit tests) in `drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/tests/`, not production kernel code. The affected file `vc4_test_pv_muxing.c` is specifically test infrastructure.
  2. **No security impact**: The dangling pointer issue described affects only test execution. The `drm_modeset_acquire_ctx` context being cleared prematurely could cause test failures or incorrect test behavior, but:
     - This code only runs during kernel unit testing
     - It doesn't affect actual VC4 DRM driver operation
     - There's no path for this to be exploited in a running system
  3. **Development/testing issue**: The commit message clearly indicates this fixes test init functions that were incorrectly managing the lifetime of test-specific atomic state allocations. The issue is that the acquire context was local to the test init function and cleared too early, leaving `state->acquire_ctx` as a dangling pointer.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they are all test/development related changes (test reordering, atomic helper additions) that were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The fix properly moves the atomic state allocation into the test functions themselves where the context lifetime can be properly managed, but this is purely a test infrastructure improvement with no security implications for production systems.
9e26a3740cc08 drm/vc4: tests: Use return instead of assert
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here is my decision:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Test infrastructure code only**: The modified file is located in `drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/tests/` and is part of the KUnit testing infrastructure for the VC4 graphics driver. This code is only compiled when `CONFIG_DRM_VC4_KUNIT_TEST` is enabled, which is explicitly described in Kconfig as "not useful for distributions or general kernels, but only for kernel developers working on the VC4 driver."
  2. **No security impact**: The change replaces `KUNIT_ASSERT_*` macros (which abort the test immediately on failure) with proper error propagation. While the commit message mentions EDEADLK handling, this is about test reliability, not a security issue. EDEADLK is a locking deadlock detection mechanism used in atomic operations, and proper handling of it in test code doesn't constitute a security fix.
  3. **Test-only functions**: The modified functions `vc4_mock_atomic_add_output()` and `vc4_mock_atomic_del_output()` are mock/test functions that simulate adding/removing outputs in the test environment. They don't run in production systems.
  4. **Error handling improvement**: The change improves error handling by properly propagating errors instead of aborting tests, which is a code quality improvement for the test infrastructure, not a security fix.
  This is similar to the first reference commit (CVE Status: NO) which also made changes to test infrastructure code without any security implications.
f945dd89fa8da drm/xe/d3cold: Set power state to D3Cold during s2idle/s3
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
34f051accedb6 drm/vc4: hdmi: Call HDMI hotplug helper on disconnect
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me provide my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The code previously only called `drm_atomic_helper_connector_hdmi_hotplug()` when the HDMI cable was connected, but not when disconnected. This meant the audio subsystem wasn't properly notified of HDMI audio disconnection events.
  2. **Impact analysis from the code**:
     - The `drm_atomic_helper_connector_hdmi_hotplug()` function calls `drm_connector_hdmi_audio_plugged_notify()` with `false` on disconnect (line 793)
     - This is purely a notification mechanism to inform the audio subsystem about HDMI audio availability
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure is involved
  3. **Security assessment**:
     - **No exploitability**: This bug cannot be exploited by an attacker
     - **No privilege escalation**: Missing audio notifications don't affect system privileges
     - **No information disclosure**: No sensitive data is exposed
     - **Physical access required**: HDMI hotplug events require physical cable manipulation
     - **Predictable behavior**: The bug results in missing notifications, not undefined behavior
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: All the provided similar commits (DRM hotplug handling, audio fixes, connector polling) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", which aligns with this being a non-security fix.
  This is a quality-of-life fix that ensures proper cleanup of audio resources when HDMI is disconnected, preventing potential resource leaks or user confusion when audio continues to appear available after HDMI disconnection.
f42c09e614f1b drm/vmwgfx: Fix dumb buffer leak
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that should be assigned a CVE.
  Let me examine the key aspects:
  1. **What the commit fixes**: The commit fixes a "dumb buffer leak" where dumb buffers were not being freed properly due to missing GEM reference drops and TTM object leaks.
  2. **Security implications of the bug**:
     - Memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion attacks where an attacker could repeatedly trigger the leak to exhaust system memory
     - The leak occurs when processes exit, as mentioned: "when the ttm_object_file was closed at process exit the destructor unreferenced an already destroyed surface"
     - This could potentially be exploited by a local attacker to cause denial of service
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - In `vmw_bo_release()`: Added proper cleanup of dirty tracking resources (`res->func->dirty_free(res)`)
     - In `vmw_dumb_create()`: Added `drm_gem_object_put(&vbo->tbo.base)` to drop the GEM reference that was leaking
     - Modified the TTM object handling to prevent the destructor from unreferencing already destroyed surfaces
     - Changed reference counting from `kref_get(&res->kref)` to `vmw_resource_reference(res)` for proper tracking
  4. **Attack vector**: A local user with access to the DRM device could create dumb buffers and cause memory leaks, potentially leading to system resource exhaustion.
  **Decision: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a memory leak vulnerability that can be triggered by unprivileged local users with access to the DRM device
  2. The vulnerability could lead to denial of service through memory exhaustion
  3. The leak is persistent (memory is not freed even when the process exits)
  4. The fix involves proper reference counting and resource cleanup, which are classic security-relevant issues
  5. Similar memory leak fixes in kernel subsystems have been assigned CVEs when they can be exploited for resource exhaustion
  The vulnerability allows local attackers to cause a denial of service condition through memory exhaustion by repeatedly creating dumb buffers that are never properly freed.
10646ddac2917 drm/ci: fix merge request rules
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It only modifies GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration (`drivers/gpu/drm/ci/gitlab-ci.yml`) and contains no kernel code changes. The changes fix CI rules to ensure merge requests trigger proper testing, remove Mesa-specific namespace checks, and adjust when pipelines run (automatic vs manual). This is purely a development infrastructure fix with no security implications for kernel runtime behavior, no attack surface, and no potential for exploitation. If anything, it improves security by ensuring better test coverage for all merge requests.
f9f087d946266 drm: xlnx: zynqmp_dpsub: fix Kconfig dependencies for ASoC
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Build configuration fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a Kconfig dependency issue that causes build failures when sound support is configured as a module (=m) while the GPU driver is built-in (=y). This is purely a build-time configuration problem.
  2. **No runtime security impact**: The issue only affects kernel compilation. It doesn't introduce any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security vulnerability at runtime.
  3. **Linker errors, not exploitable**: The commit message shows undefined reference errors during linking (`x86_64-linux-ld: undefined reference to...`). These are compilation/linking failures that prevent the kernel from building successfully in certain configurations.
  4. **Configuration constraint addition**: The fix adds a single line `depends on SND_SOC=y || DRM_ZYNQMP_DPSUB=m` which ensures that when the GPU driver is built-in, sound support must also be built-in (not a module). This is a build system constraint to ensure proper symbol resolution.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 5 (ASoC: qcom: Select missing common Soundwire module code) with CVE Status: NO is very similar - it also fixes build failures due to missing module dependencies.
  This is a development/build-time issue that affects kernel compilation but poses no security risk to systems running already-compiled kernels.
3282422bf251d drm/vmwgfx: Add error path for xa_store in vmw_bo_add_detached_resource
- [sasha] **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  After analyzing the code changes, this is a robustness improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: While xa_store() can fail due to memory allocation, the failure mode doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability. The detached_resources xarray is used for resource tracking and cleanup, but:
     - Resources are still properly reference counted through other mechanisms
     - The primary resource management happens through the res_tree RB tree (for attached resources)
     - The detached_resources list is mainly for tracking resources that have been detached from their buffer object
  2. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Looking at the code:
     - When xa_store() fails, the resource simply won't be added to the detached list
     - The resource still has proper reference counting through vmw_resource_reference/unreference
     - There's no use-after-free or double-free risk because the resource lifetime is managed independently
  3. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: The similar commits shown (nvme xa_store fix and drm/xe xa_store fix) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" despite having similar error handling improvements.
  4. **Nature of the Fix**: This is a defensive programming improvement that adds error handling where it was missing, but the absence of this error handling doesn't create a security vulnerability - it would at worst cause a resource to not be properly tracked in the detached list, which could lead to a memory leak in extreme memory pressure situations, but not a security issue.
  The commit improves code quality and robustness but doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability.
0039a3b35b10d drm/vmwgfx: Add seqno waiter for sync_files
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Reasoning:**
  1. **GUI Freeze/Denial of Service**: The commit explicitly states "This oversight results in a bug where the entire GUI can freeze" - this is a clear denial of service condition affecting system availability.
  2. **Root Cause**: The bug occurs because sync_files don't participate in fence processing, causing interrupts to be masked and fences to never signal. This leaves processes stuck indefinitely waiting on sync_files.
  3. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the same pattern as the vmwgfx fence polling deadlock (commits 1 and 4 in the similar commits list) which were assigned CVEs. Both involve fence synchronization mechanisms causing system freezes.
  4. **Attack Surface**: The sync_file interface is exposed to userspace and can be triggered by any application using explicit sync, making it accessible to unprivileged users.
  5. **Impact**: The commit states this affects login screens like GDM and can freeze the entire GUI, demonstrating significant system impact.
  6. **Long-standing issue**: The bug has existed since 2017 (commit c906965dee22) but only manifested when mutter started using sync_files heavily in 2024, indicating it's a latent security vulnerability.
  The fix adds proper interrupt-based processing by registering a seqno waiter that ensures fences associated with sync_files are properly signaled, preventing the GUI freeze condition.
dd133162c9cff ACPI: platform_profile: Avoid initializing on non-ACPI platforms
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now determine whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a bug that causes a warning message when the platform profile driver is loaded on non-ACPI systems. The issue is:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit message and code changes show this is fixing a warning (`WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1 at fs/sysfs/group.c:131`) that occurs during initialization on non-ACPI platforms. The warning is triggered because `acpi_kobj` is NULL when ACPI is disabled, and `sysfs_create_group()` is called with this NULL pointer.
  2. **No security impact**: The code simply adds a check `if (acpi_disabled) return -EOPNOTSUPP;` at the beginning of `platform_profile_init()` to prevent initialization on non-ACPI platforms. This is a functional fix that prevents incorrect behavior but doesn't address any security concerns.
  3. **Limited impact**: The issue only affects systems without ACPI support (like RISC-V systems mentioned in the commit message), and the impact is limited to a warning message during boot. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant impact.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them were assigned CVEs, and they all deal with functional fixes, quirks, and initialization issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
  This is a typical bug fix that improves code robustness by adding proper initialization checks, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it doesn't fix a security vulnerability.
62f134ab190c5 ALSA: core: fix up bus match const issues.
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether this is fixing a security vulnerability or just addressing a code correctness issue.
  Let me examine the commit in detail:
  **Commit Message Analysis:**
  - This is fixing a const-correctness issue introduced by a previous commit (d69d80484598)
  - The issue is that `container_of()` was throwing away the const attribute
  - This was "not caught by the compiler due to how container_of() is implemented"
  **Code Changes Analysis:**
  1. Changes to function signatures to properly handle const pointers:
     - `hdac_get_device_id()` now takes `const struct hdac_driver *drv`
     - `match()` callback in `struct hdac_driver` now takes `const struct hdac_driver *drv`
     - Various local variables changed from non-const to const pointers
  2. The changes are purely about const-correctness - no logic changes
  **Security Impact Assessment:**
  - This is a type safety/const-correctness fix
  - No actual vulnerability is being fixed - the code would function identically before and after
  - The const attribute is a compile-time constraint that doesn't affect runtime behavior
  - No memory corruption, access control bypass, or other security issues are addressed
  - The fix prevents potential future bugs by ensuring const pointers remain const
  **Comparison with Similar Commits:**
  Looking at the similar commits provided:
  - CVE Status: YES commits fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences that could cause crashes
  - CVE Status: NO commits were API changes, const qualifier additions, or other non-security fixes
  This commit is similar to "Similar Commit 5" which added const qualifiers and had CVE Status: NO.
  **Answer: NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a const-correctness fix that improves code quality and type safety but does not address any security vulnerability. The change is purely about maintaining proper const attributes through the call chain, which is a compile-time constraint with no runtime security impact. Unlike the commits marked with CVE Status: YES that fixed actual NULL pointer dereferences or other runtime issues, this commit only ensures that const pointers remain const throughout their usage.
ea3b0b7f541b9 EDAC/bluefield: Don't use bluefield_edac_readl() result on error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The uninitialized data usage occurs entirely within the kernel's EDAC (Error Detection and Correction) subsystem. The uninitialized values are used for error reporting through the EDAC interface, which is a diagnostic/monitoring facility typically only accessible to privileged users.
  2. **Limited Impact**: While using uninitialized stack variables is a bug that can lead to incorrect error reporting, it does not:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Enable unauthorized access to memory
     - Cause system crashes or denial of service
     - Expose sensitive kernel memory to unprivileged users
  3. **Error Path Only**: This issue only occurs when hardware register reads fail (through SMC calls on BlueField-2), which is already an error condition. The uninitialized data would only affect the accuracy of error reporting, not system functionality.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked "CVE Status: NO", they also involve fixes to error reporting accuracy in EDAC drivers without security implications (e.g., "EDAC/igen6: Fix the flood of invalid error reports", "EDAC/versal: Do not log total error counts").
  The commit properly fixes a code quality issue by adding early returns when register reads fail, preventing the use of uninitialized variables. However, this is a reliability/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
e717c661e2d1a ASoC: apple: mca: Constrain channels according to TDM mask
- [sasha] Let me review the actual code changes in the commit again. Looking at the fix:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit adds a constraint check to ensure the number of channels doesn't exceed the weight (number of set bits) of the TDM mask. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - Addition of `mca_fe_startup()` function that adds a PCM hardware constraint
     - The constraint uses `snd_pcm_hw_constraint_minmax()` to limit channels from 1 to `hweight32(mask)`
     - This prevents incorrect hardware configuration but doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues
  3. **Nature of the fix**: The commit message states "We don't (and can't) configure the hardware correctly if the number of channels exceeds the weight of the TDM mask." This indicates a functional limitation where the hardware would be misconfigured, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical commits provided, none of the ASoC fixes were assigned CVEs, including:
     - Power control mask fixes
     - Channel number modifications
     - Timing/synchronization fixes
     - Configuration corrections
  The issue being fixed is that without this constraint, userspace could request more channels than the TDM mask supports, leading to incorrect hardware configuration. This would result in audio not working properly, but it doesn't create any security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, memory leaks, or privilege escalation opportunities.
0941d5166629c spi: sh-msiof: Fix maximum DMA transfer size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **No Security Impact**: This is a logic bug in calculating the maximum DMA transfer size, but it has no actual security implications:
     - The commit message explicitly states "As currently tx_fifo_size is always equal to rx_fifo_size, this bug had no real impact"
     - All the chipdata definitions in the code show tx_fifo_size = rx_fifo_size = 64 for all variants
  2. **Nature of the Bug**: The bug is in the calculation logic where when both tx_buf and rx_buf exist, the transmit limit (l) gets overwritten by the receive limit instead of using the minimum of both:
     ```c
     // Before fix:
     if (tx_buf)
         l = min(round_down(len, 4), p->tx_fifo_size * 4);
     if (rx_buf)
         l = min(round_down(len, 4), p->rx_fifo_size * 4);  // Overwrites l
     
     // After fix:
     unsigned int max_wdlen = 256;
     if (tx_buf)
         max_wdlen = min(max_wdlen, p->tx_fifo_size);
     if (rx_buf)
         max_wdlen = min(max_wdlen, p->rx_fifo_size);
     // Uses combined minimum
     ```
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: Since tx_fifo_size equals rx_fifo_size in all cases, the overwriting produces the same result. This is a correctness fix for potential future hardware where FIFO sizes might differ, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This commit is similar to commits 2, 3, and 4 in the reference list, which optimize or fix DMA/FIFO handling logic without security implications. It differs from CVE-assigned commits 1 and 5 which fix actual data corruption issues during active transfers.
3f7cd28ae3d1a ACPI: thermal: Execute _SCP before reading trip points
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I'll provide my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes an ordering issue where the _SCP (Set Cooling Policy) ACPI method was being executed after reading trip points (_ACx and _PSV), when according to the ACPI specification section 11.4.13, it should be executed before reading them.
  Here's why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The change is a compliance fix to match ACPI specification requirements. The incorrect ordering doesn't create any security vulnerabilities like privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
  2. **Functional Correctness Issue**: This is a functional bug where the cooling policy might not be properly set before reading trip points, potentially leading to incorrect thermal management behavior, but not a security issue.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this ordering issue to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause system compromise.
  4. **Similar to Referenced Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all deal with thermal management fixes, ACPI compliance issues, and functional corrections - none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply moves the `acpi_execute_simple_method(tz->device->handle, "_SCP", ACPI_THERMAL_MODE_ACTIVE)` call to execute before `acpi_thermal_get_trip_points(tz)` instead of after it, ensuring ACPI specification compliance.
8cf4fdac9bdea ACPI: OSI: Stop advertising support for "3.0 _SCP Extensions"
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the issue. The ACPI specification changed _SCP from taking 1 argument in ACPI 1.0 to taking 3 arguments in ACPI 3.0, but the Linux thermal driver only passes 1 argument (just the cooling mode).
  **CVE Analysis Decision: NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional discrepancy, not a security issue. The commit fixes a false advertisement where Linux claimed to support "3.0 _SCP Extensions" (which requires 3 parameters) but actually only calls _SCP with 1 parameter as per ACPI 1.0.
  2. **No Exploitable Condition**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this discrepancy. The worst case is that ACPI firmware might make incorrect assumptions about OS capabilities, potentially leading to suboptimal thermal management, but not a security breach.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The issue doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant impact.
  4. **Configuration/Compatibility Issue**: This is purely a compatibility/conformance issue where the OS was incorrectly advertising support for a feature it didn't fully implement. The fix prevents potential firmware confusion but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all deal with ACPI _OSC capability advertisement corrections, which are configuration/compatibility fixes rather than security fixes.
  The commit simply removes the false advertisement of "3.0 _SCP Extensions" support since the thermal driver only implements the ACPI 1.0 version of _SCP (1 parameter) rather than the ACPI 3.0 version (3 parameters).
b49825661af93 thermal/drivers/mediatek/lvts: Fix debugfs unregister on failure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Resource leak, not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a debugfs resource leak that occurs only when probe fails after debugfs initialization but before interrupt registration. This is a cleanup/resource management bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The leaked debugfs entries:
     - Don't expose sensitive information beyond what was already intended to be exposed via debugfs
     - Don't allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation
     - Don't cause memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - Are only accessible to users with debugfs access (typically root)
  3. **Limited scope**: The leak only occurs in a specific error path during driver probe failure, which is not a common scenario in production systems.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fixed NULL pointer dereference issues that could lead to crashes/DoS
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: NO" fixed non-security issues like missing coefficients or invalid calibration data handling
     - This commit is more similar to the "NO" category as it's fixing a resource management issue
  5. **Nature of fix**: The fix uses devm_add_action_or_reset() to ensure proper cleanup on all error paths - this is a standard kernel pattern for resource management, not a security fix.
  The commit improves code quality and prevents resource leaks, but does not address any security vulnerability.
65cb56d49f6ed spi: spi-qpic-snand: validate user/chip specific ECC properties
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit adds validation checks for unsupported ECC configurations, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability. The issue is about data integrity and hardware capability limitations, not security.
  2. **Hardware Limitation, Not Bug**: The driver only supports 512-byte ECC step size and 4-bit ECC strength. When used with NAND chips requiring stronger ECC (like 8-bit), it causes data corruption. This is a hardware/driver limitation, not a security flaw.
  3. **Data Corruption vs Security**: While the commit mentions serious issues like unbootable systems and bogus data reads, these are functional failures due to using incompatible hardware configurations, not exploitable security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Input Validation Enhancement**: The fix adds proper validation to reject unsupported configurations early with error messages like:
     - `"only %u bytes ECC step size is supported"`
     - `"only 4 bits ECC strength is supported"`
  5. **Similar Commits Analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 3 & 4 (both CVE YES) fixed incorrect ECC configuration that caused kernel warnings and bitflips
     - This commit prevents using the driver with incompatible configurations rather than fixing a misconfiguration
  The key difference is that this commit prevents usage of unsupported features (proper bounds checking), while the CVE-assigned commits fixed actual bugs in ECC handling that could lead to data corruption even with supported configurations.
f48d805035042 spi: spi-qpic-snand: use kmalloc() for OOB buffer allocation
- [sasha] I can see this function doesn't free any oob_buf. Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Performance optimization only**: The change from `kzalloc()` to `kmalloc()` is purely a performance optimization. The commit message clearly states this is to avoid unnecessary zeroing of memory that will be immediately overwritten with 0xff bytes.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit does not fix any security issue. It's simply avoiding redundant work (zeroing memory that gets immediately filled with 0xff).
  3. **No behavioral change**: The functional behavior remains identical - the buffer is allocated and then filled with 0xff. The only difference is avoiding the unnecessary zeroing step.
  4. **Pattern comparison**: Looking at the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES", they all fix actual security vulnerabilities:
     - Use-after-free bugs
     - NULL pointer dereferences 
     - Missing NULL checks after allocation
     
     This commit does none of those - it's just an optimization.
  5. **Code analysis**: The change is minimal and safe:
     ```c
     - snandc->qspi->oob_buf = kzalloc(mtd->writesize + mtd->oobsize, GFP_KERNEL);
     + snandc->qspi->oob_buf = kmalloc(mtd->writesize + mtd->oobsize, GFP_KERNEL);
     ```
     The NULL check and error handling remain unchanged, and the buffer is still immediately filled with 0xff via memset().
1b17d4525bca3 PM: sleep: Print PM debug messages during hibernation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional bug where debug messages were not being printed during hibernation. The original commit (cdb8c100d8a4) restricted pm_pr_dbg messages to only print during suspend/resume but forgot about hibernation. This is purely a debugging/logging functionality issue.
  2. **No security impact**: The debug messages being printed (or not printed) contain only operational status information like "Loading hibernation image", "Writing hibernation image", "Hibernation not available", etc. There's no indication of sensitive information disclosure, privilege escalation, or any other security-relevant impact.
  3. **Debug feature only**: The pm_pr_dbg messages are controlled by the pm_debug_messages_on flag and are meant for debugging purposes. The fix simply ensures that these debug messages also work during hibernation, not just suspend/resume.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, "Similar Commit 1" which added error handling for syscore_suspend() was marked as NO CVE, and it had more potential for system instability than this logging fix.
  The change only adds `hibernation_in_progress()` check to the existing condition in `pm_debug_messages_should_print()` to ensure debug messages are printed during hibernation operations. This is a quality-of-life fix for developers/debuggers, not a security issue.
824c6384e8d92 x86/mtrr: Check if fixed-range MTRRs exist in mtrr_save_fixed_ranges()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a real bug where the kernel attempts to access fixed-range MTRR MSRs on systems that don't support them (causing a #GP fault), this does not constitute a security vulnerability. The #GP fault is gracefully handled by the kernel's existing RDMSR fault handler, and the only observable impact is a WARN_ON() message in the kernel log. There is no memory corruption, information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service. This is a code correctness issue that improves compatibility with virtualization platforms like ACRN that don't emulate fixed-range MTRRs.
8856eafcc05ec spi: atmel-quadspi: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime by using devm_ API
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a resource management cleanup issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit replaces manual PM runtime management with devm_ (device-managed) API calls to ensure proper cleanup in error paths.
  2. **Impact**: The issue is about unbalanced PM runtime reference counting in the error path of the probe function. This could lead to improper power management state but does not create any security vulnerability such as:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond driver initialization failure
  3. **Code changes analysis**: 
     - The old code had manual `pm_runtime_enable()` and cleanup calls that could be missed in error paths
     - The new code uses `devm_pm_runtime_set_active_enabled()` and `devm_pm_runtime_get_noresume()` which automatically handle cleanup
     - The removed cleanup code in the error path (`pm_runtime_put_noidle()`, `pm_runtime_disable()`, etc.) is now handled automatically by the devm framework
  4. **Similar commits comparison**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: NO" (like the other atmel-quadspi commits) deal with similar PM runtime cleanups
     - The commit marked "CVE Status: YES" (dbad41e7bb5f) was different - it caused actual runtime PM underflow that could affect system operation
  5. **Severity**: This is a driver quality issue that affects proper cleanup during error conditions but doesn't pose any security risk.
  The issue is purely a code quality/resource management problem that ensures proper cleanup of PM runtime state when the driver probe fails, preventing potential PM reference count imbalances.
73db799bf5efc PM: runtime: Add new devm functions
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not introduce a security vulnerability. It adds new convenience functions for device runtime power management:
  1. `devm_pm_runtime_set_active_enabled()` - Combines setting a device to active state and enabling runtime PM with automatic cleanup on driver removal
  2. `devm_pm_runtime_get_noresume()` - Increments usage count with automatic decrement on driver removal
  These are purely helper/convenience functions that:
  - Use existing, well-tested PM runtime APIs internally
  - Follow the devres (device resource management) pattern for automatic cleanup
  - Add proper error handling and cleanup via `devm_add_action_or_reset()`
  - Don't introduce any new security-sensitive code paths
  - Don't modify any access control, memory management, or privilege mechanisms
  - Simply provide cleaner API patterns for driver developers
  The changes are similar to the existing `devm_pm_runtime_enable()` function and follow the same safe patterns. There are no buffer overflows, race conditions, privilege escalations, or other security-relevant issues introduced by this commit.
113e04276018b ACPI: resource: fix a typo for MECHREVO in irq1_edge_low_force_override[]
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a simple typo fix changing "MECHREV" to "MECHREVO" in a comment within a DMI table entry. The change is purely cosmetic and has no functional impact on the code:
  1. **No security impact**: The change only affects a comment string ("MECHREV Jiaolong17KS Series GM7XG0M" → "MECHREVO Jiaolong17KS Series GM7XG0M")
  2. **No code behavior change**: The actual DMI_MATCH still uses "GM7XG0M" board name, which is what matters for functionality
  3. **Hardware quirk, not vulnerability**: The IRQ override table is for hardware compatibility with specific laptop models where keyboards require different IRQ settings
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: All similar commits shown (IRQ overrides for various laptop models) were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they're hardware compatibility fixes, not security vulnerabilities
  The IRQ override mechanism is a standard ACPI hardware compatibility feature for ensuring keyboards work properly on specific laptop models. This is not fixing a security vulnerability but rather correcting a typo in documentation.
f0050a3e214aa PM: wakeup: Delete space in the end of string shown by pm_show_wakelocks()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination on whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a cosmetic formatting issue in the output of `/sys/power/wake_lock` and `/sys/power/wake_unlock` sysfs attributes. The change removes an unwanted trailing space character that was inadvertently added by commit c9d967b2ce40.
  The issue is purely cosmetic and has no security implications:
  1. It only affects the string formatting in sysfs output by removing an extra space before the newline
  2. There is no memory corruption, buffer overflow, or information leak
  3. It does not affect access control, permissions, or any security boundaries
  4. The change simply ensures that when wakelock names are displayed, there isn't an extra space at the end of the list
  5. The code adds a check `if (len > 0) --len;` to remove the trailing space added by the loop that appends `"%s "` for each wakelock name
  This is similar to the other formatting fixes shown in the similar commits (like removing leading spaces from irq_chip prints or fixing inter-column spacing) which were also marked as "CVE Status: NO". It's a minor output formatting cleanup with no security impact.
7c2bad7b95db5 ASoC: SOF: amd: add missing acp descriptor field
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit adds a missing field (`acp_error_stat`) to the ACP70 chip descriptor structure that was inadvertently left out when ACP70 support was initially added.
  2. **Impact analysis**: While the missing field could theoretically cause writes to register offset 0 during error handling (as seen in `acp.c:442`), this is primarily a correctness/stability issue rather than a security vulnerability because:
     - The write only occurs during error interrupt handling, which is already an exceptional condition
     - It writes a fixed value (0) to clear error status
     - There's no user-controlled data involved
     - The register space is already protected by kernel memory access controls
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, none of them received CVEs. They all fix various configuration issues, missing entries, or incorrect register definitions in audio drivers without security implications.
  4. **Lack of exploitability**: There's no clear attack vector here. An attacker would need to:
     - Trigger specific audio hardware errors
     - Hope that writing 0 to register offset 0 causes exploitable behavior
     - This is highly hardware-specific and unlikely to be reliably exploitable
  5. **Driver maturity**: This is fixing an incomplete implementation in a newly added platform (ACP70), not introducing a regression in existing stable code.
  The commit is a proper bug fix for a missing field that could cause incorrect register access during error handling, but it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
d20df86b056b9 ASoC: Intel: avs: Fix kcalloc() sizes
- [sasha] Let me examine the code change more carefully. The commit fixes a bug where `kcalloc()` is called with `sizeof(rlist)`, `sizeof(clist)`, and `sizeof(slist)` instead of `sizeof(*rlist)`, `sizeof(*clist)`, and `sizeof(*slist)`.
  Since `rlist`, `clist`, and `slist` are declared as:
  ```c
  unsigned int *rlist, *clist, *slist;
  ```
  Using `sizeof(rlist)` returns the size of a pointer (8 bytes on 64-bit systems), while `sizeof(*rlist)` returns the size of an `unsigned int` (4 bytes).
  This means the original code was over-allocating memory on 64-bit systems (allocating 8 bytes per element instead of 4 bytes). The arrays would have twice as much memory as needed.
  **Security Analysis:**
  1. **No Memory Corruption**: The bug causes over-allocation, not under-allocation. The allocated memory is still large enough to hold the data.
  2. **No Information Disclosure**: The extra allocated memory is zeroed by `kcalloc()`, so there's no risk of leaking uninitialized data.
  3. **No Denial of Service**: While this wastes memory, the amount is minimal and unlikely to cause resource exhaustion.
  4. **No Privilege Escalation**: This is just a memory allocation size issue with no impact on access controls or privileges.
  5. **Similar Commits Analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE Status: NO) - Fixed memory string overrides
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE Status: YES) - Fixed use-after-free references to freed memory
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE Status: NO) - Fixed debug-slot offset calculation
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE Status: NO) - Separated aligned_size function
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE Status: NO) - Prefixed platform-specific members
  The commit marked with CVE Status: YES dealt with use-after-free vulnerabilities where pointers referenced freed memory, which is a serious security issue. In contrast, this commit only fixes an over-allocation issue.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The bug only causes memory over-allocation on 64-bit systems (allocating twice the needed memory), which is a performance/efficiency issue rather than a security vulnerability. There is no risk of memory corruption, information disclosure, or any exploitable condition. The fix is purely a code quality improvement to avoid wasting memory.
00a371adbbfb4 ASoC: SOF: ipc4-pcm: Adjust pipeline_list->pipelines allocation type
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a type safety fix for future compiler changes, not a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's "In preparation for making the kmalloc family of allocators type aware."
  2. **No Functional Impact**: The change only adjusts the type used in the `sizeof()` calculation from `sizeof(struct snd_sof_widget *)` to `sizeof(*pipeline_list->pipelines)`. Since both are pointer types, they have the same size on any given architecture (typically 8 bytes on 64-bit systems, 4 bytes on 32-bit systems).
  3. **Preventive Measure**: This is a proactive code cleanup to ensure type correctness for future compiler improvements. The commit prevents potential compiler warnings or errors when stricter type checking is implemented in the kernel memory allocators.
  4. **No Memory Corruption Risk**: The allocation size remains identical before and after the change. There's no buffer overflow, underflow, or any memory safety issue being fixed.
  5. **Code Style Improvement**: Using `sizeof(*pipeline_list->pipelines)` is better practice as it automatically adjusts if the type changes, making the code more maintainable.
  The similar commits I reviewed (commits 1-5) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" and were similarly focused on code refactoring, naming improvements, and structure changes without any security implications. This commit follows the same pattern of being a non-security code improvement.
a9635ef0ca12e platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Set Pin Assignment E in DP PORT VDO
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned **NO** CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a functional enhancement, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit adds support for Pin Assignment E to the DisplayPort VDO (Vendor Defined Object) configuration.
  2. **Impact analysis**: Without this change, the system simply fails to establish a DisplayPort connection when a Pin E C-to-DP cable is used - it returns -ENODEV. This is a functionality limitation, not a security issue. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Buffer overflow
     - Race condition
  3. **Code changes**: The modification is minimal and straightforward:
     ```c
     -#define DP_PORT_VDO (DP_CONF_SET_PIN_ASSIGN(BIT(DP_PIN_ASSIGN_C) | BIT(DP_PIN_ASSIGN_D)) | \
     -            DP_CAP_DFP_D | DP_CAP_RECEPTACLE)
     +#define DP_PORT_VDO (DP_CAP_DFP_D | DP_CAP_RECEPTACLE | \
     +         DP_CONF_SET_PIN_ASSIGN(BIT(DP_PIN_ASSIGN_C) | \
     +                        BIT(DP_PIN_ASSIGN_D) | \
     +                        BIT(DP_PIN_ASSIGN_E)))
     ```
     It simply adds another supported pin assignment to enable compatibility with more cable types.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits:
     - The CVE-assigned commits involved NULL pointer dereferences, race conditions, and deadlocks - actual security vulnerabilities
     - This commit doesn't introduce or fix any such security issues
  5. **Fixes reference**: While it has a "Fixes:" tag, it's fixing a functional limitation introduced in the DisplayPort support commit, not a security vulnerability.
  The commit improves hardware compatibility by supporting additional DisplayPort cable configurations but does not address any security vulnerability.
11741b8e382d3 power: supply: max77705: Fix workqueue error handling in probe
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The bug causes a clear security issue where `create_singlethread_workqueue()` returns NULL on failure, but the original code used `IS_ERR()` which returns false for NULL. This means the error path was never taken when workqueue creation failed, leaving `chg->wqueue` as NULL.
  2. **Exploitable Attack Vector**: The workqueue is used in `max77705_chgin_isr_work()` which is triggered by charger interrupts. When charger events occur (like plugging/unplugging), the code would attempt to use the NULL workqueue pointer, causing a kernel NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
  3. **Similar CVE Precedents**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 3 (nbd driver) with NULL pointer dereference in flush_workqueue - **CVE Status: YES**
     - Commit 1 (power supply driver) with NULL pointer dereference - **CVE Status: YES**
     - This commit follows the same pattern of NULL pointer dereference leading to DoS
  4. **Real Security Impact**: 
     - An attacker with physical access could trigger charger events to crash the system
     - Under memory pressure conditions where workqueue allocation fails, normal charger operations would crash the system
     - This provides a reliable denial-of-service attack vector
  5. **Code Impact**: The fix shows clear evidence of a security issue:
     ```c
     - if (IS_ERR(chg->wqueue))
     -     return dev_err_probe(dev, PTR_ERR(chg->wqueue), "failed to create workqueue\n");
     + if (!chg->wqueue)
     +     return dev_err_probe(dev, -ENOMEM, "failed to create workqueue\n");
     ```
  The vulnerability pattern matches similar CVE-assigned commits where incorrect error handling leads to NULL pointer dereferences that can cause system crashes.
179c0c7044a37 PM: EM: Fix potential division-by-zero error in em_compute_costs()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The vulnerability requires the ability to register a non-CPU device with the energy model framework. This typically requires:
     - Loading kernel modules (requires CAP_SYS_MODULE privilege)
     - Being a built-in driver initialized at boot
     - No unprivileged user-accessible interface exists to trigger this
  2. **Theoretical Nature**: Looking at the kernel tree, I couldn't find evidence of actual non-CPU devices using the energy model registration that would trigger this path. The code comment in the fix itself states "This is needed only for CPUs and EAS skip other devices", suggesting non-CPU device energy models are not actively used.
  3. **Impact Limited to DoS**: Even if triggered, this only causes a division-by-zero kernel panic (DoS), not privilege escalation or information disclosure. For local DoS vulnerabilities to warrant a CVE, they typically need to be triggerable by unprivileged users.
  4. **Similar Historical Precedent**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (NO CVE): Wrong return value fix in cppc_get_cpu_cost()
     - Commit 2 (NO CVE): Division by zero fix in ssb_calc_clock_rate
     - Commit 3 (YES CVE): NULL pointer dereference in cppc_get_cpu_cost()
     - Commit 4 (YES CVE): Same as Commit 3
     - Commit 5 (NO CVE): Wrong return value fix in cppc_get_cpu_power()
     The commits that received CVEs involved NULL pointer dereferences that could be more easily triggered, while simple division-by-zero fixes in initialization paths did not.
  5. **Defensive Programming**: This is primarily a robustness fix to prevent potential issues with future drivers, rather than fixing an actively exploitable vulnerability.
  The fix is important for kernel stability but doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
62d48983f215b power: reset: at91-reset: Optimize at91_reset()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a pure optimization patch that:
  1. Removes a redundant branch instruction (`beq 2f`) that was unnecessary because ARM's conditional execution (`strne`) already handles the null pointer case
  2. Removes an unused clobber register declaration (`r4`)
  3. Makes no functional changes to the system reset behavior
  The commit message clearly states this is an "optimization" and the code analysis confirms:
  - No security vulnerability is being fixed
  - No memory corruption, access control, or privilege issues are addressed
  - The behavior is identical before and after the change
  - This is purely a code cleanup/performance improvement
  The "Fixes:" tag references the commit that introduced the redundant code during a refactoring, not a security issue. This differs significantly from the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual security issues like reference counting leaks that could lead to resource exhaustion or memory corruption.
d8966b6541339 spi: tegra210-quad: modify chip select (CS) deactivation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit modifies chip select (CS) deactivation timing logic in a SPI driver. The change moves CS deactivation and inter-transfer delay execution to only occur during the DATA_TRANSFER phase when cs_change flag is not set.
  2. **Functional optimization**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "eliminate redundant operations" while ensuring "proper CS handling and timing between transfers." This is a performance/efficiency optimization, not a security fix.
  3. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - Moving lines 1166-1169 (CS deactivation logic) to after the transfer_phase increment
     - Adding a condition to only execute during DATA_TRANSFER phase
     - This prevents redundant CS operations during CMD_TRANSFER and ADDR_TRANSFER phases
  4. **Limited scope**: The change only affects the combined sequence transfer mode in the Tegra QSPI driver, which is used for optimizing multi-part SPI transactions (command + address + data).
  5. **No exploitation vector**: There's no evidence that the previous behavior could lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Or any other security-relevant impact
  The commit is fixing a functional issue where CS was being deactivated unnecessarily during non-data transfer phases, which could cause timing issues but not security vulnerabilities.
400d9f1a27cc2 spi: tegra210-quad: remove redundant error handling code
- [sasha] Now I understand the code flow. Let me analyze what the commit is removing:
  The commit removes these lines from the `tegra_qspi_combined_seq_xfer` function:
  ```c
  if (ret < 0) {
      tegra_qspi_transfer_end(spi);
      spi_transfer_delay_exec(xfer);
  }
  ```
  Let me check if there are any security implications by understanding what these functions do:
  1. `tegra_qspi_transfer_end()` - This function manages the chip select (CS) signal, either setting it high or low based on the SPI mode
  2. `spi_transfer_delay_exec()` - This executes any delay specified in the transfer
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The removed code is redundant error handling that duplicates functionality already present in the SPI core framework. When `transfer_one_message` returns an error, the SPI framework properly handles cleanup at a higher level.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The functions being removed from the error path (`tegra_qspi_transfer_end` and `spi_transfer_delay_exec`) only:
     - Toggle chip select signals
     - Execute timing delays
     Neither of these operations have security implications when skipped in error scenarios.
  3. **Cleanup/Optimization**: This is a code cleanup that removes unnecessary duplicated error handling. The commit message clearly states it's removing "redundant" code because "error handling is already done at a higher level in the SPI core."
  4. **Pattern Matching with Similar Commits**: The similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show a pattern of non-security fixes in the same driver, including:
     - Rate limiting for log messages
     - Warning reduction (WARN_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE)
     - Missing error handling additions
     - Shift overflow prevention
     - Redundant error check removal
  5. **No Exploitable Condition**: There's no memory corruption, information disclosure, privilege escalation, or any other exploitable security condition being fixed here.
  The commit simply removes unnecessary code that was performing cleanup operations that the SPI framework already handles, making it a maintenance/cleanup change rather than a security fix.
dcb06c638a117 spi: tegra210-quad: Fix X1_X2_X4 encoding and support x4 transfers
- [sasha] Let me understand what the corrected macros are doing:
  Based on my analysis, **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The commit fixes encoding issues in the `QSPI_COMMAND_X1_X2_X4` and `QSPI_ADDRESS_X1_X2_X4` macros, but as the commit message clearly states, "these macros were previously incorrect, they were not being used in the driver, so no functionality was affected."
  2. **Code Analysis**:
     - The original macros defined as `(((x) & 0x3) << 13)` were incorrect
     - The fix changes them to `((((x) >> 1) & 0x3) << 13)`
     - The original code hardcoded bus_width to 0 in the function calls:
       ```c
       cmd_config = tegra_qspi_cmd_config(false, 0, xfer->len);
       addr_config = tegra_qspi_addr_config(false, 0, xfer->len);
       ```
     - This meant x1 mode was always used, regardless of the actual transfer requirements
  3. **SPI_NBITS Values**:
     - SPI_NBITS_SINGLE = 0x01 (1-bit/x1 mode)
     - SPI_NBITS_DUAL = 0x02 (2-bit/x2 mode)  
     - SPI_NBITS_QUAD = 0x04 (4-bit/x4 mode)
     - The new macro shifts right by 1 to convert these values to 0, 1, 2 for the hardware register
  4. **Functional Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**:
     - This is a functionality limitation where the driver couldn't properly use x2/x4 transfer modes
     - It would result in suboptimal performance but not a security issue
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant behavior
  5. **Similar to Historical Examples**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all involve functional fixes (shift-out-of-bounds prevention, timeout handling, OCTAL mode support) and none were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply enables proper multi-bit transfer support that was intended but incorrectly implemented. It's a performance/functionality improvement, not a security fix.
4d231a7df1a85 tools/nolibc: fix integer overflow in i{64,}toa_r() and
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Limited scope and impact**: The nolibc library is a minimal C library implementation used primarily in kernel testing and selftests (tools/testing/selftests/). It's not used in production kernel code or security-critical components.
  2. **Integer overflow is undefined behavior, not a security vulnerability**: The issue is that negating the most negative integer (LONG_MIN/INT64_MIN) in two's complement representation results in undefined behavior in C. The fix properly handles this edge case by casting to unsigned before negation, which is the correct mathematical approach.
  3. **No security boundaries crossed**: Unlike the similar commits shown that were assigned CVEs (which involved network stack integer overflows that could lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption), this is just a utility function for converting integers to strings in test code.
  4. **No exploitable attack vector**: The affected functions (itoa_r and i64toa_r) are string conversion utilities. Even with the overflow, the worst case would be incorrect string representation of LONG_MIN, not memory corruption or privilege escalation.
  5. **Testing/development tool only**: The nolibc library is specifically designed for minimal environments and testing scenarios, not for production use where security would be critical.
  The similar commits that received CVEs involved:
  - Network protocol handling with potential for remote exploitation
  - File format parsing that could lead to memory corruption
  - Kernel/userspace boundaries where integer overflows could bypass security checks
  This commit fixes a correctness issue in a development tool, not a security vulnerability in production code.
0e75768ba24d6 tools/nolibc: properly align dirent buffer
- [sasha] Let me check the actual fix to understand what's happening. Looking at the commit again, I can see the key change is:
  ```c
  -	char buf[sizeof(struct linux_dirent64) + NAME_MAX + 1];
  +	char buf[sizeof(struct linux_dirent64) + NAME_MAX + 1] __nolibc_aligned_as(struct linux_dirent64);
  ```
  Now let me analyze the security implications:
  **Analysis:**
  NO - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is an alignment fix for a buffer in the nolibc library's readdir_r() function. The change adds proper alignment to a char buffer that is cast to `struct linux_dirent64`.
  2. **Location**: This code is in `tools/include/nolibc/`, which is a minimal C library used for testing and tools within the kernel source tree. It's not part of the kernel runtime itself.
  3. **Security impact**: While improper alignment could theoretically cause issues:
     - The impact is limited to userspace tools that use nolibc
     - This is not kernel code that runs with elevated privileges
     - The worst case would be a crash or incorrect behavior in a tool, not a security vulnerability
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar commit 4 (CVE: YES) fixed an actual memory error in realloc() that could lead to out-of-bounds memory access
     - This commit only fixes alignment, not a memory safety issue
     - Other commits marked NO were also non-security improvements (optimization, formatting, etc.)
  5. **Risk assessment**: 
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No memory corruption beyond the tool's own memory space
     - No information disclosure risk
     - Limited to development/testing tools, not production kernel code
  The commit is a correctness fix to ensure proper struct alignment, which is important for portability and avoiding undefined behavior, but does not constitute a security vulnerability warranting a CVE assignment.
eeed3e03f4261 EDAC/{skx_common,i10nm}: Fix the loss of saved RRL for HBM pseudo channel 0
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Impact**: This is a bug fix for incorrect register saving/restoring behavior in the EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) driver. The issue only affects error logging functionality, not system security.
  2. **Limited Scope**: The bug only occurs when:
     - Using Intel 10nm server processors with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory)
     - The retry_rd_err_log module parameter is set to 2 (Linux RRL control mode)
     - The driver is being unloaded
  3. **Functional Bug, Not Vulnerability**: The commit message clearly states this is about "the loss of saved RRL for HBM pseudo channel 0" which causes "RRL of pseudo channel 0 of HBM to be wrongly restored with the values from pseudo channel 1 when unloading the driver." This is a functional correctness issue where:
     - Pseudo channel 1's values overwrite pseudo channel 0's saved values during driver loading
     - Wrong values are restored during driver unloading
     - This only affects error logging register settings, not security-critical functionality
  4. **No Exploitation Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this bug to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Escalate privileges
     - Cause denial of service
     - Leak sensitive information
     - Bypass security controls
  5. **Driver Configuration Issue**: The fix changes how the driver saves/restores hardware register configurations for error logging. It creates separate storage (`rrl_ctl[2][NUM_RRL_SET]`) for each pseudo-channel to prevent overwriting, which is purely a driver internal state management issue.
  This is similar to the reference commits provided which also deal with EDAC driver improvements and fixes but were marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they don't introduce security vulnerabilities.
20d2d476b3ae1 EDAC/skx_common: Fix general protection fault
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a general protection fault (kernel crash) that occurs only during a specific administrative sequence: unloading the i10nm_edac module, reloading it, and then performing error injection testing. This is not a security vulnerability but rather a bug in module lifecycle management.
  2. **Administrative Action Required**: The issue only manifests when an administrator with root privileges performs the specific sequence of module unload/reload operations. This is not an attack vector that can be exploited by unprivileged users or remote attackers.
  3. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The fix addresses a simple programming error where `adxl_component_count` was not reset to 0 in the cleanup function `skx_adxl_put()`. This leads to an out-of-bounds memory access on module reload, but doesn't involve:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Bypassing security controls
     - Remote code execution
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve EDAC driver improvements, refactoring, or bug fixes that don't have security implications. This commit follows the same pattern.
  5. **Nature of the Fix**: The fix is a single line `adxl_component_count = 0;` that ensures proper cleanup. It's a quality/reliability fix rather than a security fix.
  The general protection fault is certainly a bug that needed fixing for system stability, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it's not a security vulnerability.
7af317f7faaab ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Set ETDM1/2 IN/OUT to COMP_DUMMY()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, my answer is:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a NULL pointer dereference that occurs during driver probe at boot time when the device tree doesn't assign a codec to certain DAI links. The crash happens in `__pi_strcmp` when `mt8195_mt6359_soc_card_probe()` tries to compare a NULL `dai_name` pointer.
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Boot-time only**: The crash occurs during driver initialization at system boot, not during runtime operation
  2. **Not exploitable**: There's no attack vector - the crash is triggered by the kernel's own initialization code based on device tree configuration
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a simple programming error (accessing NULL pointer) that causes a kernel panic during boot
  4. **Deterministic behavior**: It will always crash in the same way if the device tree is configured without codec assignments
  The fix correctly changes `COMP_EMPTY()` to `COMP_DUMMY()` for ETDM2_IN_BE and ETDM1_OUT_BE, ensuring that a valid dummy codec structure is present with `dai_name = "snd-soc-dummy-dai"`, preventing the NULL pointer access.
  This is a stability/quality issue that should be fixed (as it was), but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
dd50f0e38563f ASoC: tas2764: Enable main IRQs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my conclusion:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed**: The commit is enabling interrupt notifications that were previously masked. The IRQ handler (tas2764_irq) only logs error messages when faults occur - it doesn't take any corrective action beyond clearing the interrupt status.
  2. **The masked interrupts were not hiding a security issue**: The interrupts being unmasked are for hardware fault conditions like:
     - Over temperature
     - Over current  
     - Bad TDM clock
     - Power supply issues (PVDD below limiter)
     - Limiter activation
  3. **No exploitable condition**: Even with interrupts masked (0xff), the hardware protection mechanisms would still function - they just wouldn't notify the kernel. The IRQ handler only provides diagnostic logging via `dev_crit_ratelimited()` and `dev_err_ratelimited()`.
  4. **This is a functional improvement, not a security fix**: The commit improves debugging and monitoring capabilities by allowing the driver to log when hardware protection events occur, but it doesn't fix any vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, denial of service, or other security impacts.
  The change from `0xff` (all interrupts masked) to `0x00` (interrupts enabled) on INT_MASK0 simply allows the driver to receive and log notifications about hardware fault conditions, which is useful for diagnostics but has no security implications.
592ab3936b096 ASoC: tas2764: Reinit cache on part reset
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if it represents a security vulnerability.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds `regmap_reinit_cache(tas2764->regmap, &tas2764_i2c_regmap);` after resetting the hardware in `tas2764_codec_probe()`. This ensures the software cache is synchronized with the hardware state after a reset.
  2. **Functional issue, not security**: This is a functional correctness issue where the regmap cache could become out of sync with the actual hardware state after a reset. This could lead to:
     - Incorrect audio configuration
     - Wrong volume levels
     - Improper power states
     - General audio malfunction
  3. **No security implications**: The commit doesn't address any of the typical security concerns:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - No privilege escalation paths
     - No information disclosure
     - No access control bypass
     - No input validation issues
     - The component is an audio codec driver handling audio configuration, not security-sensitive operations
  4. **Similar pattern**: The commit message references a similar fix for tas2770 driver (commit 0a0342ede303), indicating this is a common pattern/bug fix for this family of audio codec drivers.
  5. **Impact limited to audio functionality**: The worst-case scenario is incorrect audio behavior or device malfunction, not any security compromise of the system.
  This is a quality/reliability fix ensuring proper driver operation after hardware reset, but does not constitute a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
9c138ac939222 tools/nolibc/types.h: fix mismatched parenthesis in minor()
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the issue is a syntax error that prevents compilation.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a simple syntax error (missing closing parenthesis) in the `minor()` macro definition. The error would cause a compilation failure whenever the macro is used, making it impossible to compile any code that uses the broken `minor()` macro. This is a build-time error with no runtime security implications:
  1. The missing parenthesis in `#define minor(dev) ((unsigned int)(((dev) & 0xff))` causes a syntax error
  2. Any attempt to use this macro results in a compilation error
  3. No code with this bug could ever be successfully compiled and executed
  4. This is purely a build/compilation issue, not a security vulnerability
  The commit is similar to the "tools/mm: fix compile error" example which was marked as "CVE Status: NO" - both fix syntax errors that prevent compilation.
0f8af0356a455 ACPICA: exserial: don't forget to handle FFixedHW opregions for reading
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functionality fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit adds a missing case statement for `ACPI_ADR_SPACE_FIXED_HARDWARE` in the read path of `acpi_ex_read_serial_bus()`.
  2. **Impact analysis**:
     - Without this fix, reads from FFH (Functional Fixed Hardware) operation regions would fail with `AE_AML_INVALID_SPACE_ID` error
     - This is a denial of functionality issue, not a security vulnerability
     - The code would return an error status rather than cause any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  3. **Code behavior**:
     - The switch statement at line 158 handles different address space types
     - The write path already had the FFH case handled (lines 326-330)
     - The read path was missing this case, causing it to fall through to the default case which returns `AE_AML_INVALID_SPACE_ID`
     - The fix simply adds the missing case to set appropriate buffer length and function parameters
  4. **No security implications**:
     - No buffer overflows or underflows
     - No uninitialized memory access
     - No privilege boundary violations
     - No information leaks
     - The error path safely returns without any dangerous side effects
  This is a typical bug fix that completes the implementation of FFH operation region support by ensuring both read and write paths handle this address space type consistently.
0a3cf32da469f crypto: api - Redo lookup on EEXIST
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific change in the commit. The key change is in the crypto_larval_wait function where it adds handling for the EEXIST case:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The commit addresses a race condition during crypto algorithm instantiation where two lookups with different names (e.g., "ctr(aes-generic)" and "ctr(aes)") for the same algorithm can result in duplicate instantiation attempts, with the second one failing with EEXIST.
  2. **Not a security flaw**: This is a functional issue that causes legitimate algorithm lookups to fail unnecessarily. The change improves reliability by retrying the lookup when EEXIST is encountered, but does not fix any security vulnerability.
  3. **Code analysis**: The change modifies line 223 from:
     ```c
     } else if (!alg) {
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     } else if (!alg || PTR_ERR(alg) == -EEXIST) {
     ```
     This simply adds a retry mechanism for EEXIST errors, treating them similarly to the case where no algorithm is found.
  4. **No security impact**: The issue being fixed doesn't allow:
     - Unauthorized access to memory
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond a failed lookup
     - Any form of exploitation
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Like the similar commits provided (which were all marked as NO CVE), this is a crypto API improvement that enhances functionality but doesn't address security vulnerabilities.
  The commit improves the robustness of the crypto subsystem's algorithm lookup mechanism but does not fix any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
5a90f8d499225 gfs2: Don't start unnecessary transactions during log flush
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit based on the changes described in the initial message. Looking at the commit details provided:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a potential deadlock/lockup condition in the GFS2 filesystem's log flush mechanism. The issue is that after commit 8d391972ae2d, the code would try to reserve log space and start a transaction before determining if pages were already journaled, which could lead to a situation where there appears to be insufficient log space for freeing up log space.
  2. **Not a Security Vulnerability**: This is a reliability/availability issue, not a security vulnerability:
     - It's a deadlock condition that affects system availability
     - There's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or data corruption
     - The impact is limited to denial of service (system hang) for GFS2 filesystems
     - It requires specific timing conditions during log flush operations
  3. **Limited Attack Surface**: 
     - This only affects systems using GFS2 filesystem with journaled data (jdata) inodes
     - It's triggered during normal filesystem operations (log flush), not through malicious input
     - An attacker would need write access to a GFS2 filesystem to potentially trigger this
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - The CVE-assigned commits in the examples involve NULL pointer dereferences that could lead to kernel crashes
     - This commit fixes a deadlock, which is generally considered less severe than memory safety issues
  The fix introduces `gfs2_jdata_writeback()` to handle journal writes directly instead of going through the generic `aops->writepages()` path, avoiding the problematic transaction allocation during log flush. This is a functional fix for a filesystem reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability.
d50a64e3c55e5 gfs2: Move gfs2_trans_add_databufs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure refactoring**: The commit is simply moving the `gfs2_trans_add_databufs()` function from `aops.c` to `trans.c`. This is a code organization change with no functional modifications.
  2. **No security implications**: The changes are:
     - Moving the function definition from one file to another
     - Changing the first parameter from `struct gfs2_inode *ip` to `struct gfs2_glock *gl`
     - Updating call sites to pass `ip->i_gl` instead of `ip`
     - Removing the function declaration from `aops.h` and adding it to `trans.h`
  3. **No bug fixes**: The commit message explicitly states this is just moving the function to a more appropriate location. There's no mention of fixing any vulnerability or security issue.
  4. **Same functionality**: The core logic of the function remains identical - it still iterates through buffer heads in a folio and calls `gfs2_trans_add_data()` on them. The only change is accessing the glock directly instead of through the inode structure.
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the "NO CVE" commits were simple refactoring changes like this. The one "YES CVE" commit (similar commit 5) actually fixed a security issue by truncating the address space when flipping the GFS2_DIF_JDATA flag.
  This is a typical code cleanup/refactoring commit that improves code organization but doesn't address any security vulnerabilities.
772e50a76ee66 kunit: Fix wrong parameter to kunit_deactivate_static_stub()
- [sasha] Perfect! I can see that the `KUNIT_STATIC_STUB_REDIRECT` macro checks `kunit_get_current_test()` and if there's no test running (which is the normal case in production), it just breaks out of the do-while loop and continues with normal execution.
  Based on my analysis, here's my final assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Test Infrastructure Only**: The bug is in KUnit's static stub functionality, which is part of the kernel's unit testing framework. The `KUNIT_STATIC_STUB_REDIRECT` macro (line 64-65) explicitly checks if a test is running and does nothing in production kernels.
  2. **Safe Failure Mode**: The bug causes an immediate assertion failure with a clear error message ("Tried to deactivate a NULL stub") rather than any exploitable condition like memory corruption or undefined behavior.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The bug only affects the undocumented behavior of passing NULL to `kunit_activate_static_stub()` to deactivate a stub. When triggered, it would cause a test to fail, not a security issue.
  4. **No Security Implications**: There's no potential for:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service in production systems
     - Any other security-relevant impact
  5. **Production Safety**: Even though some production code contains `KUNIT_STATIC_STUB_REDIRECT` calls (as seen in drivers), these are inactive unless a KUnit test is running, which doesn't happen in production kernels.
  The commit is a simple parameter correction that fixes test functionality, similar to the ext4 mballoc-test fix in the reference commits which was also marked as "CVE Status: NO".
aa3ee4f0b7541 sched/fair: Fixup wake_up_sync() vs DELAYED_DEQUEUE
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on what I've seen:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a performance/scheduling accuracy bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that `wake_affine_idle()` was incorrectly checking `rq->nr_running == 1` without accounting for delayed dequeue tasks, which remain visible in `nr_running` but are not actually runnable.
  2. **Impact**: The bug causes incorrect CPU selection for wake_up_sync() operations. Instead of properly detecting when the current CPU has only one running task (making it a good candidate for the waking task), it could incorrectly count delayed tasks as running. This leads to suboptimal scheduling decisions but no security impact.
  3. **Code changes**: The fix simply replaces the check from:
     ```c
     if (sync && cpu_rq(this_cpu)->nr_running == 1)
     ```
     to:
     ```c
     if (sync && (rq->nr_running - cfs_h_nr_delayed(rq)) == 1)
     ```
     This correctly subtracts the number of delayed (not actually running) tasks to get the real count.
  4. **No security boundaries crossed**: The bug doesn't allow:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Memory corruption
     - Access control bypass
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Like the similar commits shown (which all have "CVE Status: NO"), this is a scheduler correctness fix that improves performance/fairness but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
  The commit is a functional fix for the DELAYED_DEQUEUE feature to ensure wake_up_sync() makes correct scheduling decisions, but it has no security implications.
c822831b42630 crypto: sun8i-ce - move fallback ahash_request to the end of the struct
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a **memory corruption vulnerability** with security implications:
  1. **Struct Layout Violation**: The `struct ahash_request` contains a flexible array member `void *__ctx[] CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR` at the end, which must be the last member of any containing struct. The original code placed `fallback_req` (which is a `struct ahash_request`) before the `flow` member, violating this requirement.
  2. **Buffer Overflow Risk**: When the crypto subsystem writes to the flexible array `__ctx[]` in `fallback_req`, it would overflow into the `flow` member that follows it, causing memory corruption. This can lead to:
     - Data corruption of the `flow` field
     - Potential control flow hijacking if `flow` is used to determine execution paths
     - Unpredictable behavior in crypto operations
  3. **Security Component**: This affects the cryptographic subsystem, which is a critical security component. Memory corruption in crypto code can lead to:
     - Bypass of cryptographic protections
     - Information disclosure
     - System instability
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits, we see that memory corruption issues in crypto drivers (like the sun8i-ce use-after-free) have been assigned CVEs.
  The fix correctly moves `fallback_req` to the end of the struct with a comment "// keep at the end" to prevent future mistakes. This is a classic memory safety issue that could be exploited to compromise the integrity of cryptographic operations.
270b6f13454cb crypto: xts - Only add ecb if it is not already there
- [sasha] Looking at the code changes, this commit addresses a logic issue in the xts_create function. The key changes are:
  1. **Before**: The code would always prepend "ecb(" to a cipher name if the initial lookup failed with -ENOENT, without checking if "ecb(" was already present.
  2. **After**: The code now checks with `memcmp(cipher_name, "ecb(", 4)` before prepending "ecb(" to avoid double-wrapping.
  **Analysis of Security Impact:**
  This is a bug fix that prevents creating malformed algorithm names like "ecb(ecb(aes))" when "ecb(aes)" is passed as input. While this is a logic error, it does not appear to have security implications because:
  1. It's an algorithm name handling issue, not a memory corruption or privilege escalation vulnerability
  2. The worst case would be a failed algorithm instantiation or incorrect algorithm naming
  3. There's no evidence of exploitable conditions like buffer overflows, information disclosure, or authentication bypass
  4. The fix simply prevents redundant "ecb(" prefixing in algorithm names
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a bug introduced in commit f1c131b45410, the issue is a benign logic error in algorithm name handling that would at worst cause algorithm instantiation to fail or create incorrectly named algorithms. There are no security implications such as memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. The commit is a simple quality improvement that prevents redundant "ecb(" prefixing when constructing algorithm names.
3d73909bddc2e crypto: lrw - Only add ecb if it is not already there
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change fixes a functionality bug in the LRW (Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner) cipher mode implementation, specifically in how it handles cipher names that already have the "ecb(" prefix. 
  The bug would cause the code to incorrectly attempt to create cipher names like "ecb(ecb(aes))" when the input was already "ecb(aes)", which would fail during cipher instantiation. However, this is purely a functionality issue that:
  1. Does not introduce any memory corruption or buffer overflows - all string operations are bounded by CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME
  2. Has proper error handling that returns appropriate error codes (-ENOENT, -ENAMETOOLONG)
  3. Does not expose sensitive information or create information leaks
  4. Cannot be exploited for privilege escalation
  5. At worst causes cipher creation to fail, which is handled gracefully
  The change also replaces `strncmp` with `memcmp` for consistency, which is a minor code improvement but has no security implications. This is similar to the other non-CVE commits shown in the examples that fix functionality issues without security impact.
da6b85598af30 rcu/cpu_stall_cputime: fix the hardirq count for x86 architecture
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding context, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is purely a diagnostic accuracy fix. The commit corrects the hardirq count displayed in RCU CPU stall warning messages by including architecture-specific interrupt counts (NMIs, APIC timer interrupts, thermal interrupts, etc.) that were previously omitted.
  2. **Only Affects Debugging Output**: The bug only affected the diagnostic information printed when an RCU stall is detected. From the example in the commit message, it showed "0" hardirqs when it should have shown "2498". This incorrect count doesn't affect the actual RCU stall detection mechanism itself.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The missing arch_irq_stat_cpu() call doesn't create any exploitable condition. It doesn't:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Cause memory corruption
     - Create a denial of service vulnerability
     - Expose sensitive information
     - Affect system stability or security
  4. **Diagnostic Tool Enhancement**: RCU CPU stall detection is a debugging/diagnostic feature used to identify performance issues and potential bugs. Having accurate hardirq counts helps administrators and developers diagnose system problems, but incorrect counts don't compromise security.
  5. **Similar to Previous Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked with "CVE Status: NO"), they are also documentation fixes, diagnostic improvements, or counting/display fixes - none of which warrant CVE assignment.
  The commit is important for system administrators and kernel developers who need accurate diagnostic information when troubleshooting RCU stalls, but it doesn't fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
17a85f520469a btrfs: fix wrong start offset for delalloc space release during mmap write
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The bug is an accounting error in the btrfs filesystem's internal space reservation mechanism. It causes incorrect space accounting but does not cross any security boundaries or expose sensitive information.
  2. **No Privilege Escalation**: The issue does not allow users to gain elevated privileges or access resources they shouldn't have access to.
  3. **Impact is Limited to Resource Accounting**: The commit message states this "may result in releasing more space then we should and eventually trigger an underflow of the data space_info's bytes_may_use counter." This is an internal accounting issue that could potentially lead to filesystem misbehavior but not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-3 and 5 (all marked "CVE Status: NO") deal with similar space accounting, delalloc handling, and internal btrfs operations
     - Only Commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) was assigned a CVE, and it dealt with a different type of issue involving direct IO writes that could cause filesystem corruption visible to users
  5. **Bug Type**: This is a logic error in calculating the correct offset for releasing reserved space. The wrong calculation (`page_start` instead of `end + 1`) causes more space to be released than intended, but this is an internal consistency issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The fix correctly changes the start parameter from `page_start` to `end + 1` to release only the excess reserved space beyond what's actually needed, preventing the accounting underflow.
d3914d6030aa6 btrfs: fix invalid data space release when truncating block in NOCOW mode
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a space accounting bug in NOCOW mode truncation, but it does not represent a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is an accounting error where `btrfs_delalloc_release_space()` is called even when data space was never reserved in NOCOW mode, leading to an underflow in the `bytes_may_use` counter.
  2. **Impact is limited to space accounting**: The bug affects internal filesystem space accounting counters, not security boundaries. While it can cause incorrect space tracking, it doesn't:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Enable unauthorized access to data
     - Cause memory corruption that could be exploited
     - Create a denial of service condition that could be triggered by unprivileged users
  3. **Trigger conditions**: The bug requires:
     - A specific error path (failure to get folio after deciding to use NOCOW)
     - NOCOW mode on the file
     - Truncating a block operation
  4. **Comparison with similar CVE commits**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES", this commit:
     - Doesn't fix a qgroup quota bypass issue
     - Doesn't lead to resource leaks that could accumulate
     - Doesn't affect data integrity or cause data loss
     - Is purely an internal accounting fix
  The bug is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The underflow in `bytes_may_use` counter would be noticed as incorrect space reporting but doesn't create an exploitable security condition.
f2c19541e421b btrfs: scrub: fix a wrong error type when metadata bytenr mismatches
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The bytenr mismatch check on line 619 (in the old code) was incorrectly using `csum_error_bitmap` instead of `meta_error_bitmap`. Looking at the function more closely:
  1. Line 618 checks if the logical bytenr matches what's stored in the header
  2. Lines 627-636 check the fsid - correctly uses `meta_error_bitmap`
  3. Lines 637-646 check the chunk tree uuid - correctly uses `meta_error_bitmap`
  4. Lines 663-671 check the actual checksum - correctly uses `meta_error_bitmap`
  5. Lines 673-682 check the generation - correctly uses `meta_error_bitmap`
  The bytenr check was the only one incorrectly using `csum_error_bitmap` which is meant for data blocks, not metadata blocks.
  **NO**, this commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a bug fix that corrects an incorrect error classification, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. The issue is that when a metadata block has a bytenr mismatch (indicating potential corruption or inconsistency), it was being incorrectly categorized as a checksum error rather than a metadata error. While this could affect scrub repair operations and error reporting, it does not create any security vulnerability that could be exploited. The scrub operation would still detect and report the error, just with the wrong classification. This is a correctness issue rather than a security issue.
ec1f3a207cdf3 btrfs: scrub: update device stats when an error is detected
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided information.
  Looking at the commit details:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit fixes a functionality regression where device statistics were not being updated when scrub errors were detected. The commit message clearly states it's fixing missing error reporting functionality: "scrub no longer updates the device stats when hitting an error."
  2. **Only affects monitoring/statistics**: The changes only add missing calls to `btrfs_dev_stat_inc_and_print()` to properly update and report device statistics. This is purely a monitoring/diagnostic feature, not a security mechanism.
  3. **No security impact**: The lack of device statistics updates doesn't create any security vulnerabilities. It only means administrators wouldn't see error counts in device stats, but the actual error detection and repair functionality was still working.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that fix scrub-related issues without security implications (like "update last_physical after scrubbing one stripe" and "run relocation repair when/only needed") were marked as NO CVE.
  5. **Code changes confirm**: The code changes show:
     - Adding a new bitmap for metadata generation errors (`meta_gen_error_bitmap`)
     - Adding device stat increment calls in error reporting paths
     - No changes to access control, privilege checks, or security-sensitive operations
  This is a functional bug fix that restores proper error reporting/statistics, not a security vulnerability fix.
d36e3f11fe8b5 powerpc/pseries/iommu: Fix kmemleak in TCE table userspace view
- [sasha] Now let me trace back to understand the issue. The bug is in the condition check:
  ```c
  static void tce_free_pSeries(struct iommu_table *tbl)
  {
  -	if (!tbl->it_userspace)
  +	if (tbl->it_userspace)
  		tce_iommu_userspace_view_free(tbl);
  }
  ```
  The original code had a negation (`!`) which caused the function to free the userspace view only when it was NULL (which makes no sense). The fix removes the negation so it frees the userspace view when it exists.
  **Analysis:**
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a memory leak bug. When VFIO is used to assign a device to userspace (e.g., for virtualization), memory is allocated via `vzalloc()` for the userspace view of the TCE table. Due to the incorrect condition check, this memory is never freed when the device is closed.
  2. **Security implications**: 
     - This is a resource exhaustion vulnerability
     - An unprivileged user with access to VFIO (which requires specific permissions) could repeatedly open/close devices to leak memory
     - The leaked memory size can be significant (16MB and 4MB in the examples shown)
     - This could lead to denial of service through memory exhaustion
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could cause kernel crash
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Same as commit 2, fixed kernel crash vulnerability
     - Similar Commit 5 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a memory leak in RDMA subsystem
  4. **Attack requirements**:
     - Attacker needs access to VFIO interface (typically requires being in specific groups or having CAP_SYS_RAWIO)
     - Attacker needs ability to open/close VFIO devices repeatedly
     - This is exploitable by local users with appropriate permissions
  **NO**
  While this is a memory leak that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion, it does not warrant a CVE because:
  1. **Limited attack surface**: The vulnerability requires specific permissions (VFIO access) which are not available to unprivileged users by default
  2. **Not a direct security boundary crossing**: Unlike the similar commits that got CVEs (which involved kernel crashes/panics), this is "just" a memory leak
  3. **Mitigation exists**: System administrators can limit VFIO access to trusted users
  4. **Impact is limited**: While it can cause resource exhaustion, it doesn't allow privilege escalation, information disclosure, or direct system compromise
  The key difference from Similar Commit 5 (which got a CVE for a memory leak) is that the RDMA subsystem memory leak was likely more widely accessible and had broader security implications in terms of who could trigger it.
9748f2f54f667 erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type
- [sasha] Now I understand the full UAF scenario. Let me trace through it:
  1. `erofs_fc_get_tree` is called
  2. It calls `get_tree_bdev_flags` with `erofs_fc_fill_super`
  3. Inside `get_tree_bdev_flags`, if the device lookup fails with ENOTBLK, it returns -ENOTBLK
  4. But before returning, if `fill_super` (which is `erofs_fc_fill_super`) was called and failed, `deactivate_locked_super` is called
  5. `deactivate_locked_super` calls `fs->kill_sb` which is `erofs_kill_sb`
  6. `erofs_kill_sb` calls `erofs_sb_free(sbi)` which frees the `sbi` structure
  7. Back in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, when it gets -ENOTBLK, it tries to access `sbi->dif0.file`, but `sbi` has already been freed, causing UAF
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. The commit message clearly describes the UAF scenario where `sbi` is freed in `deactivate_locked_super` -> `erofs_kill_sb` -> `erofs_sb_free` when `erofs_init_device` returns -ENOTBLK, but then `erofs_fc_get_tree` continues to use the freed `sbi` structure when checking for the -ENOTBLK error condition.
  The fix converts -ENOTBLK to -EINVAL in `erofs_init_device`, preventing the UAF by avoiding the specific error path in `erofs_fc_get_tree` that would access the freed memory. This is a classic memory safety issue that could lead to system crashes or potentially be exploited for privilege escalation.
510de8363f2c3 erofs: fix file handle encoding for 64-bit NIDs
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a functional bug where EROFS file handle encoding fails for files with NIDs (node IDs) larger than 32 bits. This causes NFS exports and overlayfs to return -ESTALE errors when trying to access these files, but it doesn't create any security vulnerability.
  2. **Denial of functionality, not security**: The commit message and reproduction steps show this is a functionality issue - files simply cannot be accessed via NFS or overlayfs when their NIDs exceed U32_MAX. Users get an error (-ESTALE) rather than any security compromise.
  3. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The code changes show the fix is replacing `generic_encode_ino32_fh` (which truncates 64-bit NIDs to 32 bits) with custom encoding functions that properly handle 64-bit NIDs. There's no security boundary being crossed or sensitive data being exposed.
  4. **Similar to commit 3 (NO CVE)**: This is similar to the NFSD endianness fix (commit 3) which was also marked as NO CVE - both are functional fixes for file handle encoding that prevent proper operation but don't create security issues.
  The fix properly encodes 64-bit NIDs by splitting them into two 32-bit values (high and low parts) in the file handle, which is a straightforward functional correction rather than a security patch.
1bafd82d9a40c crypto: marvell/cesa - Avoid empty transfer descriptor
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the information provided:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit prevents creation of empty TDMA (Transfer DMA) descriptors when `req->nbytes == 0`. This is a logic/efficiency fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Code change analysis**: The modification changes the condition from `if (iter.src.sg)` to `if (iter.base.len > iter.src.op_offset)`. This ensures that DMA operations are only initiated when there's actual data to transfer, avoiding empty transfers.
  3. **Impact assessment**: The issue being fixed appears to be:
     - Performance/efficiency related (avoiding unnecessary empty DMA operations)
     - Proper handling of edge cases where `req->src` is set but `req->nbytes == 0`
     - No security boundary violations, memory corruptions, or privilege escalations
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: The similar commits provided (commits 1-5) all received "CVE Status: NO" and they fixed:
     - Configuration issues (lowering priority for broken algorithms)
     - Memory leaks and incorrect parsing (authenc setkey fixes)
     - Array size hardcoding
     - Missing dependencies
  None of these were security vulnerabilities warranting CVEs, and this commit follows the same pattern of being a functional/correctness fix rather than a security fix.
  The commit improves the driver's robustness by handling an edge case more correctly, but does not address any exploitable security vulnerability.
8a4e047c6cc07 crypto: marvell/cesa - Handle zero-length skcipher requests
- [sasha] So when nents=0, the for_each_sg loop doesn't execute at all, meaning dma_direct_map_sg would return 0 (no mappings created).
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Memory safety issue**: Without the check for zero-length requests, the code proceeds to call `dma_map_sg()` with `nents=0`, which returns 0 (indicating no mappings). The code incorrectly interprets this as an error (-ENOMEM) and proceeds down error paths.
  2. **Potential for accessing uninitialized/random memory**: The commit message explicitly states "Do not access random memory for zero-length skcipher requests", indicating that without this fix, the code may access memory that hasn't been properly initialized or allocated for the zero-length case.
  3. **Security-relevant component**: This is in the cryptographic subsystem (CESA - Cryptographic Engines and Security Accelerator), which is security-critical infrastructure.
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits with CVE Status: YES, they involve:
     - Improper memory handling in crypto code (commit 2: incorrect use of kfree instead of aead_request_free)
     - Memory corruption in crypto code (commit 3: bogus SGL free on zero-length error path)
     - Memory cleanup issues in crypto/auth code (commit 5: same as commit 2)
  5. **Attack vector**: An attacker could potentially trigger zero-length cipher requests through the crypto API, leading to undefined behavior and potential information disclosure or system instability.
  The fix properly handles the edge case by returning 0 (success) immediately for zero-length requests, preventing any memory access or DMA operations on non-existent data.
23b88515a3186 kselftest: cpufreq: Get rid of double suspend in rtcwake case
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Testing Infrastructure Only**: The changes are in `tools/testing/selftests/cpufreq/`, which is test infrastructure code, not production kernel code. This is similar to the referenced commits that were marked "CVE Status: NO" for test-related changes.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The bug causes a test automation issue where the system suspends twice (once with RTC wakeup, then again without wakeup), leaving it suspended indefinitely in automated testing. This is a functional bug in test code, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No Production Systems Affected**: This only affects developers or CI systems running cpufreq kernel selftests with the specific `-t suspend_rtc` or `-t hibernate_rtc` options. It doesn't affect normal system operation or expose any security risks.
  4. **Simple Logic Error**: The fix is a straightforward control flow correction - moving the manual suspend command into an else block so it doesn't execute after rtcwake has already performed the suspend/resume cycle.
  Unlike the commits marked "CVE Status: YES" in the examples (which fixed actual kernel security issues like race conditions or privilege escalation), this is purely a test harness bug with no security implications.
a26a339a654b9 brd: fix discard end sector
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Impact**: The bug causes an integer underflow that leads to freeing more ramdisk pages than intended during a discard operation. However, it only affects pages within the ramdisk device itself - it cannot free arbitrary kernel memory or affect other processes' data.
  2. **Access Requirements**: Exploiting this requires write access to the block device, which typically requires root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges. An attacker with these privileges already has many other ways to cause data loss.
  3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The bug doesn't cross any security boundaries, doesn't lead to privilege escalation, and doesn't allow unauthorized access to data. It's a functional correctness issue that can cause unintended data loss within the ramdisk.
  4. **Constrained Scope**: The impact is limited by the rd_size parameter (the while loop condition `aligned_sector < rd_size * 2`), and only affects pages actually allocated in the ramdisk's xarray structure.
  While this is definitely a bug that needs fixing (as it can cause data loss), it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE. It's similar to other filesystem/block device bugs that can cause data corruption when privileged users issue malformed commands.
d4099f8893b05 brd: fix aligned_sector from brd_do_discard()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code changes and comparing with similar commits, I conclude:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The bug is a calculation error in `brd_do_discard()` where `(sector + PAGE_SECTORS) & ~PAGE_SECTORS` doesn't correctly round up the sector to the next PAGE_SECTORS boundary. The fix properly uses `round_up(sector, PAGE_SECTORS)`.
  While this could theoretically cause incorrect discarding behavior (either missing pages that should be discarded or discarding wrong pages), the security impact is limited because:
  1. This is in the RAM disk (brd) driver which handles temporary in-memory storage, not persistent data
  2. The bug doesn't cause crashes, hangs, or privilege escalation
  3. It's a simple arithmetic error similar to Similar Commit 4 (drm/xe/vram: fix ccs offset calculation) which was marked NO CVE
  4. The impact is confined to incorrect page alignment during discard operations
  Unlike Similar Commits 3 and 5 which received CVEs for causing hung tasks and divide-by-zero errors respectively, this bug doesn't create a denial-of-service condition or system instability.
ca698ec2f0787 x86/insn: Fix opcode map (!REX2) superscript tags
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit is a syntax/formatting fix in the x86 instruction decoder opcode map text file. The issue is that when the REX2 prefix annotations were added, they used a space instead of a comma to separate multiple superscript tags (e.g., `(f64) (!REX2)` instead of `(f64),(!REX2)`). 
  This is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It's a build-time issue in a text-based opcode map that gets processed by an AWK script to generate instruction attribute tables
  2. The incorrect formatting would affect the parsing/generation of the instruction decoder tables, not runtime behavior
  3. It's a syntactic issue in a development/build tool, not a runtime code execution issue
  4. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant impact
  5. The similar commits show this is consistent with other non-CVE formatting/syntax fixes in the same opcode map files
  The fix simply adds commas between superscript tags to match the expected format for proper parsing by the AWK script that generates the instruction attribute tables.
cc663ba3fe383 x86/cpu: Sanitize CPUID(0x80000000) output
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a logic bug where garbage values from CPUID(0x80000000) on old x86-32 CPUs could be used for subsequent extended CPUID leaf checks. However, this does not introduce any security vulnerability.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The bug only affects:
     - Old x86-32 machines without extended CPUID range
     - The garbage value would simply cause incorrect feature detection
     - The code still validates the CPUID output with `(eax & 0xffff0000) == 0x80000000` before accessing 0x80000001
  3. **Feature Detection Only**: The affected code paths are purely for CPU feature detection and capability enumeration. The worst case is that some CPU features might be incorrectly detected, but this doesn't:
     - Allow privilege escalation
     - Cause memory corruption
     - Bypass security checks
     - Expose sensitive information
  4. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 & 2: Fixed CPUID validation for descriptors - marked NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 3: Fixed CPUID unlocking issue - marked NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 4: Fixed counter enumeration - marked NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 5: Fixed cache line size defaults - marked NO CVE
  All these similar CPUID-related fixes were not assigned CVEs because they fix functional bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit message itself describes this as fixing "invalid" checks rather than fixing any security issue. The change simply ensures that `c->extended_cpuid_level` is set to 0 when no valid extended CPUID range exists, preventing incorrect feature detection on old hardware.
f66cf69eb8765 blk-throttle: Fix wrong tg->[bytes/io]_disp update in __tg_update_carryover()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The bug fixes an incorrect calculation in the block throttling subsystem's carryover mechanism. Specifically:
  1. **Arithmetic error**: The code incorrectly used `tg->bytes_disp[rw] -= *bytes` (compound subtraction) instead of `tg->bytes_disp[rw] = -*bytes` (assignment of negative value), which could lead to wrong throttling calculations.
  2. **No security impact**: This bug only affects I/O throttling accuracy and fairness between cgroups. It does not:
     - Enable privilege escalation
     - Allow bypassing security boundaries
     - Create information disclosure vulnerabilities
     - Enable denial of service beyond what could be configured administratively
  3. **Administrative control required**: Exploiting this bug would require administrative privileges to modify cgroup throttling configurations, making it a functional/performance issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The similar commits shown as examples support this assessment - bugs in throttling calculations that affect performance/fairness but don't create security vulnerabilities are typically marked as "CVE Status: NO".
9334f427576e6 crypto: sun8i-ce - undo runtime PM changes during driver removal
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and similar commits provided as reference, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a missing cleanup call during driver removal. The commit adds `pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend()` to properly undo `pm_runtime_use_autosuspend()` that was called during initialization.
  2. **No security impact**: The missing cleanup is a runtime PM bookkeeping issue that:
     - Does not expose sensitive data
     - Does not allow unauthorized access
     - Does not cause memory corruption
     - Does not lead to privilege escalation
     - Does not create any exploitable condition
  3. **Pattern consistency**: All the similar commits provided (spi-fsl-lpspi, spi-zynqmp-gqspi, spi-geni-qcom, atmel-quadspi, dwc3-am62) were marked with "CVE Status: NO". They all fix the same type of runtime PM cleanup issue.
  4. **Resource management fix**: The change simply ensures proper cleanup of runtime PM settings during driver removal by switching to `devm_pm_runtime_enable()` which automatically handles both `pm_runtime_disable()` and `pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend()` during driver removal.
  5. **No exploitable consequences**: Even without this fix, the worst case is improper PM state tracking when the driver is removed and potentially reloaded, which is a functionality/correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
  The commit is a proper driver cleanup fix that improves code correctness but does not address any security vulnerability.
c6e888d02d51d selftests: coredump: Raise timeout to 2 minutes
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed** - The commit only increases the timeout for a test case from the default 30 seconds to 120 seconds to accommodate slower machines.
  2. **The change is purely in test infrastructure** - The modification is to `tools/testing/selftests/coredump/stackdump_test.c`, which is a self-test file, not production kernel code. Test infrastructure changes do not qualify for CVEs.
  3. **No security impact** - The commit message clearly states the issue is that the test runtime (nearly 20s) is dangerously close to the timeout limit (30s) on slower systems like qemu-system-riscv64. This is a test reliability issue, not a security issue.
  4. **Similar to other timeout adjustments** - Looking at the similar commits provided, we can see that timeout adjustments in selftests (like commit fc836129f708 for selftests/net/lib and commit 85506aca2eb4 for selftests/mqueue) were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  5. **The actual code change** - The only change is replacing `TEST_F(coredump, stackdump)` with `TEST_F_TIMEOUT(coredump, stackdump, 120)`, which simply sets a 120-second timeout for the test execution.
  This is a straightforward test infrastructure improvement to prevent false test failures on slower systems, with no security implications whatsoever.
6f5bf9f37f066 selftests: coredump: Fix test failure for slow machines
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a fix to a test case in the selftests directory (`tools/testing/selftests/coredump/`), not a fix to kernel code that runs in production environments.
  2. **What the fix addresses**: The commit fixes a race condition in the test itself where it was waiting for a file to be created by the coredump handler, but on slow machines (like qemu-system-riscv64), the 10-second timeout wasn't sufficient. The fix adds a `waitpid()` call to wait for the child process to finish before checking for the output file.
  3. **No security implications**: The change only affects test reliability and has no impact on:
     - Kernel security
     - User data protection
     - System stability
     - Access controls
     - Any production code paths
  4. **Test-only scope**: The modified file is located in `tools/testing/selftests/`, which contains code that is only executed during kernel testing and development, never in production systems.
  5. **Similar commits reference**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them received CVEs, and they all made changes to test infrastructure or test reliability, similar to this commit.
  The commit is purely a test improvement to handle timing issues on slower machines and has no security relevance whatsoever.
e194d2067c958 selftests: coredump: Properly initialize pointer
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the issue more carefully based on what I've found.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Location**: The bug is in a selftest file (`tools/testing/selftests/coredump/stackdump_test.c`), not in production kernel code. Selftests are development/testing tools that don't run in production systems.
  2. **Nature of the bug**: It's an uninitialized pointer bug in test code. While the pointer `line` was not initialized before being passed to `getline()`, this only affects the test's reliability, not any kernel functionality or security.
  3. **Impact**: The commit message states "It can still work if the stack is zero-initialized" and the bug only "shows up while running the test on a riscv64 machine." This indicates it's a test reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **No security boundary crossed**: This is purely a bug in test code that could cause the test to fail or behave unpredictably. It doesn't affect the kernel's security posture or expose any vulnerabilities to users.
  5. **Similar to other test fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the selftest fixes were assigned CVEs (commits 1 and 2 are test additions/fixes marked as "CVE Status: NO").
  The fix properly initializes the `line` pointer to NULL and adds the corresponding `free(line)` call, which is the correct way to use `getline()`, but this is just fixing a test reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.
b43dc4ab09785 x86/microcode/AMD: Do not return error when microcode update is not necessary
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the complete flow:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security issue. The commit fixes an incorrect error return value when the microcode is already up-to-date.
  2. **Bug behavior**: After commit 6f059e634dcd, when AMD microcode loading was attempted but the microcode was already up-to-date, the function would:
     - AMD's `load_microcode_amd()` returns `UCODE_OK` (meaning success, microcode already current)
     - The new `load_late_locked()` function's switch statement didn't handle `UCODE_OK`
     - It would fall through to the default case and return `-EBADFD` (bad file descriptor error)
  3. **Impact**: The impact is purely functional - users would see an error message when trying to reload microcode that's already current, even though no actual error occurred. This is a user experience issue, not a security problem.
  4. **The fix**: Simply adds `case UCODE_OK: return 0;` to properly handle the case where microcode is already up-to-date, returning success (0) instead of an error.
  This is a typical maintenance/bug fix that corrects improper error handling introduced by a code refactoring. It has no security implications.
b7ca5743a2604 sched/core: Tweak wait_task_inactive() to force dequeue sched_delayed tasks
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Performance/Correctness Issue, Not Security**: The commit fixes a performance regression where `wait_task_inactive()` was experiencing timeouts due to tasks remaining on the runqueue in a `sched_delayed` state. This caused delays in operations like `smpboot_create_threads()` but does not create any security vulnerability.
  2. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The issue is entirely within the kernel's internal scheduling mechanisms. It doesn't allow:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond temporary performance degradation
     - Memory corruption
     - Any form of code execution
  3. **Limited Scope**: The impact is confined to specific kernel operations that use `wait_task_inactive()`, primarily:
     - CPU hotplug operations (`smpboot_create_threads()`)
     - kthread binding operations
     - ptrace operations
     These are controlled kernel operations, not attack vectors.
  4. **Nature of Fix**: The fix simply forces dequeuing of `sched_delayed` tasks when `wait_task_inactive()` is called. This is a correctness adjustment to handle the new delayed dequeue feature properly, not a security hardening measure.
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, those marked with "CVE Status: YES" involve:
     - Sleeping in atomic context (potential system crashes)
     - Deadlock conditions that could hang the system
     - Memory allocation failures in critical paths
     
     This commit doesn't have such severe implications - it's just ensuring a function completes in reasonable time rather than hitting timeouts.
  The commit is a scheduler optimization/correctness fix that addresses a performance regression introduced by the delayed dequeue feature, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
882b25af265de powerpc/crash: Fix non-smp kexec preparation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  This is a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The bug only affects crash dump generation on non-SMP PowerPC systems. When the system crashes, the CPU register state (NT_PRSTATUS ELF note) is not saved in the crash dump due to `crashing_cpu` not being initialized. This makes debugging harder but doesn't create any security risk.
  2. **Limited Scope**: The issue only occurs:
     - On PowerPC systems with non-SMP configuration
     - During kernel crash/panic situations
     - When generating kdump crash dumps
     
  3. **No Exploitability**: This bug cannot be exploited to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Escalate privileges
     - Cause denial of service (system is already crashing)
     - Leak sensitive information
  4. **Debugging Feature**: The affected functionality is purely for post-mortem debugging. Missing CPU register data in crash dumps is inconvenient for developers but poses no security risk.
  5. **Similar to Historical Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (NO CVE): Compile error fix
     - Commit 2 (NO CVE): ELF loading initialization fix
     - Commit 3 (YES CVE): Fixed a crash that could be triggered
     - Commit 4 (NO CVE): Boot configuration default change
     - Commit 5 (YES CVE): Fixed a crash vulnerability with scv instructions
  This commit is more similar to commits 1 and 2 (functionality fixes) than to commits 3 and 5 (crash vulnerabilities that could be triggered).
497b7794aef03 powerpc: do not build ppc_save_regs.o always
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. It's a simple build system fix that corrects a missing dollar sign in a Makefile condition. The bug caused `ppc_save_regs.o` to be built unconditionally instead of only when CONFIG_XMON, CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE, or CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S are enabled.
  The security impact is none - this is purely a build optimization issue. The `ppc_save_regs` function just saves CPU register state and is only called by specific kernel subsystems (debugging, crash dumps, system reset handling). Including it unnecessarily in builds doesn't create any security vulnerabilities, expose sensitive information, or provide any attack surface. It merely results in a slightly larger kernel binary.
  This is a classic example of a non-security bug fix that improves build correctness but has no security implications whatsoever.
2dfc7cd74a5e0 crypto: sun8i-ss - do not use sg_dma_len before calling DMA functions
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of both the commit message and code changes:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a bug where `sg_dma_len()` was incorrectly used before DMA mapping. This caused CBC crypto operations to fail completely on certain kernel configurations, rather than silently producing incorrect results.
  2. **Fail-safe behavior**: The bug manifests as crypto selftest failures, meaning the system detects and prevents the incorrect behavior rather than allowing potentially insecure operations to proceed.
  3. **No exploitable security impact**: Unlike the similar commits shown as examples (which fixed memory leaks and use-after-free vulnerabilities), this bug:
     - Does not leak memory or sensitive information
     - Does not cause use-after-free conditions
     - Does not allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation
     - Simply causes crypto operations to fail when they shouldn't
  4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects specific kernel configurations (multi_v7_defconfig) and causes immediate, detectable failures rather than subtle security weaknesses.
  The key difference from the CVE-assigned examples is that those involved memory safety issues (leaks, use-after-free) which are classic security vulnerabilities, while this commit fixes a logic error that prevents the driver from working correctly but doesn't introduce an exploitable weakness.
f31adc3e356f7 crypto: sun8i-ce-cipher - fix error handling in sun8i_ce_cipher_prepare()
- [sasha] Now I have a clear picture. Let me analyze this:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes error handling bugs in the DMA cleanup paths, but these are not security vulnerabilities. Here's why:
  1. **Issue 1 - Incorrect DMA unmap on dst failure**: The code would attempt to unmap DMA memory for `areq->dst` even if the `dma_map_sg()` for dst had failed. This is a bug that could cause warnings in the DMA debug API, but it doesn't expose any security vulnerability - it's just trying to unmap memory that was never mapped.
  2. **Issue 2 - Invalid DMA address on IV mapping failure**: When `dma_map_single()` fails for the IV (returning an error via `dma_mapping_error()`), the code jumps to `theend_iv` where it would try to unmap `rctx->addr_iv` which contains an invalid DMA address. Again, this triggers DMA debug warnings but doesn't create a security vulnerability.
  Both issues are driver bugs that affect correctness and could cause kernel warnings/traces, but they don't:
  - Allow privilege escalation
  - Expose kernel memory
  - Enable denial of service beyond what a user with crypto access could already do
  - Create any exploitable condition
  The fixes simply ensure proper cleanup by checking that DMA mappings were successful before attempting to unmap them. This is a quality/correctness fix, not a security fix.
f51972e6f8b9a perf/core: Fix broken throttling when max_samples_per_tick=1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does NOT warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The bug is in the PMU interrupt throttling mechanism, which is a performance/resource management feature, not a security feature. While excessive interrupts can degrade performance, they don't cross privilege boundaries or expose sensitive information.
  2. **Limited Impact**: The bug only manifests when `max_samples_per_tick=1`, which is an edge case configuration. The commit message shows that at default HZ values (100-250), this results in 100-250 extra interrupts per second - annoying but not catastrophic.
  3. **No Exploitation Vector**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commits in the examples (which involved crashes, NULL pointer dereferences, or system hangs), this bug merely allows more interrupts than intended. There's no crash, no privilege escalation, and no way for an attacker to leverage this for malicious purposes.
  4. **Performance vs Security**: The code change shows this is purely a logic error in counting (using `>` instead of `>=`), which causes the first interrupt to bypass the throttling check. This is a performance bug, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits:
     - CVE-assigned ones involved actual crashes (commit 4) or system stability issues with "irq loop stuck" warnings (commit 5)
     - Non-CVE commits were about fixing configuration issues or performance problems without security implications
  The bug is a simple off-by-one error in the throttling logic that allows one extra interrupt per tick when the limit is set to 1, resulting in higher-than-expected interrupt rates but no security impact.
2c63986dd35fa gfs2: deallocate inodes in gfs2_create_inode
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes an internal GFS2 filesystem consistency issue related to inode deallocation during creation failures. While it addresses a race condition that was introduced by a previous fix (commit 9ffa18884cce), the security impact is limited:
  1. **Error Path Only**: The issue only occurs when inode creation fails, requiring specific error conditions that are not easily controllable by an attacker.
  2. **Internal Cleanup Logic**: The changes move deallocation logic from `gfs2_evict_inode()` to `gfs2_create_inode()` - this is an internal refactoring to ensure proper cleanup rather than fixing an exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **No Direct Security Impact**: The code changes show:
     - Removal of `GIF_ALLOC_FAILED` flag checks in `evict_should_delete()`
     - Addition of proper deallocation in the error path of `gfs2_create_inode()`
     - These are correctness fixes rather than security boundary violations
  4. **Similar Precedent**: The referenced similar commits dealing with GFS2 eviction and cleanup issues were all marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating this type of internal filesystem cleanup fix typically doesn't warrant a CVE.
  The commit addresses a reliability issue that could potentially cause resource leaks or filesystem inconsistencies, but does not represent a security vulnerability that would allow privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service under attacker control.
0cc617a54dfe6 gfs2: Move GIF_ALLOC_FAILED check out of gfs2_ea_dealloc
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a pure refactoring change that moves the GIF_ALLOC_FAILED flag check from inside the `gfs2_ea_dealloc()` function to being passed as an explicit boolean parameter. The functional behavior remains exactly the same:
  1. The code still skips certain cleanup operations when GIF_ALLOC_FAILED is set (indicating incomplete inode initialization)
  2. The logic is preserved - just moved from `if (likely(!test_bit(GIF_ALLOC_FAILED, &ip->i_flags)))` inside the function to `if (initialized)` with the parameter passed from the caller
  3. The commit message explicitly states this is for "a cleaner follow-up patch" - indicating it's code cleanup, not a bug fix
  This is similar to the provided reference commits (like "gfs2: Rename GLF_VERIFY_EVICT to GLF_VERIFY_DELETE" and "gfs2: Get rid of gfs2_alloc_blocks generation parameter") which were also refactoring changes marked as NO CVE. The commit doesn't address any security vulnerability, memory corruption, race condition, or access control issue.
bcd18105fb34e gfs2: Move gfs2_dinode_dealloc
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure code reorganization**: The commit is simply moving two functions (`gfs2_dinode_dealloc()` and its helper `gfs2_final_release_pages()`) from `super.c` to `inode.c` with no behavioral changes to the code itself.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit message clearly states "Move gfs2_dinode_dealloc" - it's a refactoring operation, not a bug fix or security fix.
  3. **Function visibility change is not security-relevant**: While `gfs2_dinode_dealloc()` changes from static to exported (added to inode.h), this is a normal part of code reorganization when moving functions between compilation units. The function is still internal to the GFS2 filesystem module.
  4. **No vulnerable code patterns**: The moved functions deal with inode deallocation which is a normal filesystem operation. There are no fixes for:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory leaks
     - Race conditions
     - Access control issues
     - Input validation problems
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the "gfs2: Get rid of gfs2_alloc_blocks generation parameter" and "gfs2: Rename gfs2_lookup_{ simple => meta }" commits which were also code refactoring/cleanup operations that did not receive CVEs.
  This is a maintenance/cleanup commit that improves code organization by moving related functions to a more appropriate source file, with no security implications.
af4044fd0b77e gfs2: gfs2_create_inode error handling fix
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue! The original commit set `inode = ERR_PTR(-EISDIR)`, which means `inode` contains an error pointer. However, when the code jumps to `fail_gunlock`, the condition `if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(inode))` would evaluate to false (since inode is an error pointer), so the error value in `error` variable would not be properly set.
  The fix changes this by:
  1. Setting `inode = NULL` instead of `ERR_PTR(-EISDIR)`
  2. Setting `error = -EISDIR` explicitly
  This ensures that the proper error code is returned.
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit fixes an error handling bug where the wrong error code might be returned when trying to create a file with O_CREAT but finding a directory with the same name. Instead of properly returning -EISDIR, the code might return an incorrect error value.
  This is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It's purely an error handling fix that ensures the correct error code (-EISDIR) is returned to userspace
  2. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
  3. The bug only affects the error code returned to the application, not the actual behavior - the operation still fails as expected
  4. It doesn't allow bypassing any security checks or accessing unauthorized resources
  The commit is simply fixing a functional bug where the wrong error code might be returned, which could confuse applications but poses no security risk.
ae9f3bd8259a0 gfs2: replace sd_aspace with sd_inode
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes an important architectural issue in GFS2's metadata writeback handling, it does not meet the criteria for a security vulnerability warranting a CVE:
  1. **No Direct Security Impact**: The issue is primarily a functional bug where GFS2 metadata address spaces were incorrectly associated with the block device's writeback context instead of GFS2's. This is an accounting/attribution error rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **Limited Scope**: The issue only affects systems using GFS2 filesystem with cgroups enabled. The impact is limited to incorrect cgroup writeback accounting for metadata operations.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Corruption**: The bug does not allow:
     - Unauthorized access to data
     - Privilege escalation
     - Memory corruption
     - Code execution
     - Data corruption (GFS2's journaling protects against this)
  4. **Resource Accounting Issue**: At worst, this could cause metadata writes to be incorrectly attributed to different cgroups, potentially allowing minor bypasses of cgroup IO limits. However, this is a resource accounting issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to Historical Patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided, CVEs were assigned to commits that fixed actual security vulnerabilities like:
     - Truncating address space when flipping GFS2_DIF_JDATA flag (which could mix incompatible page structures)
     
  This commit is more similar to the non-CVE commits that performed code refactoring or fixed functional issues without direct security implications.
2492e5aba2be0 perf/x86/amd/uncore: Prevent UMC counters from saturating
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a functional bug where UMC (Unified Memory Controller) performance counters would saturate and report incorrect accumulated counts. Unlike L3 and DF counters that roll over on overflow, UMC counters set an overflow bit (bit 48) and stop counting.
  2. **Impact Analysis**:
     - The issue only affects performance monitoring accuracy for memory controller metrics
     - It causes incorrect performance counter readings (accumulated counts)
     - There is no privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure
     - The fix simply adds proactive counter reset logic to prevent saturation
  3. **Code Changes**: The fix adds a new `amd_uncore_umc_read()` function that:
     - Checks if bit 47 is set (indicating the counter is close to saturation)
     - Resets the counter when this condition is detected
     - This prevents the counter from reaching bit 48 (overflow/saturation)
  4. **Security Implications**: None. This is purely a quality/correctness issue for performance monitoring:
     - No security boundaries are crossed
     - No sensitive data is exposed
     - No system stability issues
     - Only affects the accuracy of performance metrics
  5. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Similar to commit 1 (NO CVE) - PMU registration/functionality issues
     - Unlike commits 2 and 3 (YES CVE) which involved integer overflows and warning conditions that could potentially be exploited
  The commit fixes a functional limitation in performance monitoring counters but has no security impact.
4f81cc2d1bf91 perf/x86/amd/uncore: Remove unused 'struct amd_uncore_ctx::node' member
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure cleanup change**: The commit removes an unused `hlist_node node` member from `struct amd_uncore_ctx` that was left over from a previous refactoring (commit d6389d3ccc13).
  2. **No security impact**: 
     - The struct is kernel-internal and never exposed to userspace
     - Memory is allocated with `kzalloc()` which zeros all fields, preventing info leaks
     - The unused member was never accessed, so removing it cannot introduce any vulnerabilities
     - This is performance monitoring code that already requires elevated privileges to access
  3. **Improves code quality**: Removing unused fields actually improves security by:
     - Reducing memory footprint 
     - Eliminating confusion about the purpose of the field
     - Preventing potential future misuse
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the cleanup/refactoring changes that removed unused code or fixed non-security bugs were assigned CVEs. All had "CVE Status: NO".
  This is a straightforward code cleanup with no security implications whatsoever.
1d31d536871fe kunit: qemu_configs: Disable faulting tests on 32-bit SPARC
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **This is a test configuration change, not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit disables a specific test (`CONFIG_KUNIT_FAULT_TEST=n`) that deliberately triggers kernel faults as part of the KUnit testing framework on 32-bit SPARC systems.
  2. **The fault test is intentionally dangerous**: The kunit_fault_test deliberately causes NULL pointer dereferences and other kernel faults to test the fault handling mechanism. This is not a vulnerability - it's a test that intentionally tries to crash the kernel.
  3. **The change prevents test-induced crashes, not real vulnerabilities**: The commit message clearly states that "some architectures don't handle deliberate segfaults in kernel mode well" and that 32-bit SPARC crashes when running this test. Disabling the test prevents these deliberate crash attempts during testing.
  4. **This follows established patterns**: The fault test is already disabled for UML (User Mode Linux) architecture for similar reasons - certain architectures cannot safely handle these deliberate fault injections during testing.
  5. **No security boundary is crossed**: This is purely about test infrastructure compatibility. Users cannot trigger these faults - they only occur when developers explicitly run KUnit tests with this specific test enabled.
  The similar commits provided as reference confirm this pattern - configuration changes to testing infrastructure (like adjusting console settings or enabling specific features for testing) are not assigned CVEs unless they fix actual security vulnerabilities in production code.
d16b3d0fb43cb kunit: qemu_configs: sparc: Explicitly enable CONFIG_SPARC32=y
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes are purely cosmetic and organizational:
  1. **No security impact**: The commit only adds an explicit `CONFIG_SPARC32=y` configuration line to make it clearer that this kunit test configuration is for 32-bit SPARC. According to the kernel's Kconfig, `SPARC32` is already defined as `def_bool !64BIT`, meaning it would have been enabled automatically when 64BIT is not set.
  2. **Testing infrastructure only**: This change is in `/tools/testing/kunit/qemu_configs/`, which is part of the kernel unit testing framework. It doesn't affect any production kernel code, drivers, or security-sensitive components.
  3. **Documentation/clarity improvement**: The commit message explicitly states this is to "make the difference clearer" in preparation for adding a separate 64-bit configuration. It's a preparatory change for better organization.
  4. **No functional change**: The configuration would have resulted in the same 32-bit build before and after this change. The explicit setting just makes the intent more obvious.
  Unlike the CVE-assigned commits in the examples (which fixed actual security issues like oversized memory allocations that could trigger warnings/crashes), this is purely a testing configuration clarification with no security implications.
c7e68043620e0 crypto: zynqmp-sha - Add locking
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code, here is my assessment:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Race Condition with Security Impact**: The commit fixes a race condition in the `zynqmp_sha_digest` function where multiple concurrent hash operations can corrupt each other's data. The driver uses global static DMA buffers (`ubuf` and `fbuf` at line 43-44) that are shared across all hash operations without any synchronization.
  2. **Information Disclosure Vulnerability**: When two threads call `zynqmp_sha_digest` concurrently:
     - Thread A's data copied to `ubuf` can be overwritten by Thread B's data
     - Thread A might read Thread B's hash result from `fbuf`
     - This allows one process to potentially read hash results computed from another process's data
  3. **Cryptographic Integrity Compromise**: The race condition leads to:
     - Incorrect hash calculations (data corruption in shared buffers)
     - Hash results being swapped between concurrent operations
     - Potential bypass of security checks that rely on hash verification
  4. **Hardware State Corruption**: The commit message explicitly states "The hardware is only capable of one hash at a time". Concurrent calls to `zynqmp_pm_sha_hash()` without synchronization can corrupt the hardware state machine, leading to undefined behavior.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned Issues**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - The deadlock fixes (Similar Commits 1 & 2) were assigned CVEs for mutex issues
     - The use-after-free fix (Similar Commit 4) was assigned a CVE
     - This issue is arguably more severe as it involves data corruption and information disclosure
  The fix adds a spinlock (`zynqmp_sha_lock`) that ensures exclusive access to the hardware and shared buffers during the entire hash operation, properly serializing all concurrent accesses.
6b7f9397c98c7 crypto: ecdsa - Fix NIST P521 key size reported by KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The issue is a cosmetic/reporting bug where KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY incorrectly reports NIST P521 key size as 528 bits instead of 521 bits. The bug occurs because `crypto_sig_keysize()` returned bytes (66) which was then multiplied by 8, resulting in 528 instead of 521.
  This is purely an informational reporting error with no security impact:
  - The actual cryptographic operations continue to work correctly with 521-bit keys
  - No cryptographic strength is compromised
  - No exploitable vulnerability is created
  - It's just incorrect metadata being returned to userspace
  The fix changes the API to have `crypto_sig_keysize()` return bits instead of bytes, which is a proper correction but not a security vulnerability fix.
3828485e1c7b1 crypto: ecdsa - Fix enc/dec size reported by KEYCTL_PKEY_QUERY
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me check lines 138-145 more carefully - these are the critical security checks:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Information disclosure fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes incorrect reporting of encryption/decryption capabilities for ECDSA keys. ECDSA keys cannot perform encryption/decryption operations - they can only sign/verify. The bug was that `max_enc_size` and `max_dec_size` were being reported as non-zero values when they should be 0.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: Looking at the code in `keyctl_pkey.c`, lines 138-145 show that these values are used for input validation:
     - For KEYCTL_PKEY_ENCRYPT: checks if input/output lengths are within bounds
     - For KEYCTL_PKEY_DECRYPT: checks if input/output lengths are within bounds
     
     However, ECDSA keys would fail at the actual operation level anyway since they don't support encryption/decryption operations. The incorrect size reporting doesn't lead to any actual security issue.
  3. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: The similar commits shown (commits 1-3) are all refactoring or cleanup changes related to ECDSA that were not assigned CVEs. They fix code quality issues but not security vulnerabilities.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: Even with the incorrect values, attempting to use ECDSA keys for encryption/decryption would fail at the crypto operation level (in `software_key_eds_op()`). The commit simply makes the query interface report accurate capability information.
  5. **Contrast with CVE-assigned commit**: Similar commit 4 (CVE assigned) fixed an actual integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to security issues in cryptographic calculations. This current commit is just fixing metadata reporting accuracy.
  The commit improves API correctness by ensuring that ECDSA keys properly report 0 for `max_enc_size` and `max_dec_size`, reflecting their actual capabilities, but this doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
8feb053d53194 sched: Fix trace_sched_switch(.prev_state)
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the code changes in detail. The commit is fixing a case where the tracepoint sees a stale task state. Let me check similar commits marked with CVE:
  Looking at similar commit 5 which has "CVE Status: YES", that commit fixed "sched_fork() races" where tasks could be exposed through the pidhash before being placed on the runqueue, creating race conditions that could affect system behavior.
  The current commit fixes a much simpler issue - it's a tracing accuracy problem where:
  1. When `signal_pending_state()` returns true, the task state is changed to TASK_RUNNING
  2. But the tracepoint was using the old state value (stale `prev_state`)
  3. The fix passes `prev_state` by pointer so it can be updated when the state changes
  The code change is minimal:
  - Changed `try_to_block_task()` to take `unsigned long *task_state_p` instead of `unsigned long task_state`
  - Added `*task_state_p = TASK_RUNNING;` when signal is pending
  - Changed the call site from `try_to_block_task(rq, prev, prev_state)` to `try_to_block_task(rq, prev, &prev_state)`
  This is purely a tracing/observability fix - it doesn't affect scheduler behavior, just ensures the trace event sees the correct state. There's no security impact, no potential for exploitation, and no effect on system stability or correctness.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a minor tracing accuracy fix that only affects the value reported in trace events when a task has a signal pending. Unlike the CVE-assigned commit about sched_fork() races which could lead to actual race conditions affecting system behavior, this commit only ensures trace events report the correct task state for debugging/monitoring purposes. There are no security implications or potential for system instability.
ea4dd134ef332 crypto: sun8i-ce-hash - fix error handling in sun8i_ce_hash_run()
- [sasha] I'll analyze based on the information provided in the commit.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a memory leak vulnerability in the sun8i-ce crypto driver. The vulnerability occurs when `sun8i_ce_hash_run()` encounters errors at various points but fails to properly unmap DMA buffers before returning. This leads to DMA memory leaks.
  Specifically, the commit shows:
  1. The original code had multiple error paths (after `dma_map_sg()`, `dma_map_single()` calls) that would `goto theend` without properly unmapping the allocated DMA resources
  2. The fix restructures the error handling to ensure proper cleanup in the correct order:
     - `err_unmap_result:` unmaps the result DMA buffer
     - `err_unmap_src:` unmaps the source scatter-gather list
     - `err_free_result:` frees the result buffer
     - `err_free_buf:` frees the main buffer
  This pattern is similar to the CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples:
  - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed memory leak when dma_iv mapping fails
  - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed result memory leak on error path
  - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) - Fixed memory leak of pad buffer
  The vulnerability could potentially be exploited by triggering the error conditions repeatedly to exhaust DMA memory resources, leading to a denial of service condition. This makes it a security issue warranting a CVE assignment.
cc98d8ce934b9 crypto: iaa - Do not clobber req->base.data
- [sasha] This is the key finding! The `crypto_request_complete` function calls the completion callback with `req->data` as the first parameter. This means that `req->base.data` is passed to the user's completion callback function.
  Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The commit fixes a driver bug where the IAA crypto driver was incorrectly overwriting the `req->base.data` field with `idxd_desc`. However, this does not create a security vulnerability because:
     - The field is only used in async mode (`ctx->async_mode`)
     - The overwritten value is not used in a way that could cause memory corruption, information disclosure, or other security issues
     - The completion callback receives this data parameter, but the driver doesn't actually use it
  2. **Limited Scope**: The bug only affects the async mode of the IAA crypto driver when interrupts are NOT used (`ctx->use_irq` is false but `ctx->async_mode` is true), which is a specific configuration that doesn't affect the default operation.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: There's no evidence that this bug could be exploited to:
     - Cause memory corruption
     - Leak sensitive information  
     - Elevate privileges
     - Cause denial of service
  4. **API Contract Violation Only**: The issue is that the driver violates the crypto API contract by modifying a field that belongs to the user/caller. While this is incorrect behavior, it doesn't create a security vulnerability.
  The commit message correctly identifies this as a driver bug ("The req->base.data field is for the user and must not be touched by the driver"), but it's a functional correctness issue rather than a security issue.
1f13c60d84e88 x86/idle: Remove MFENCEs for X86_BUG_CLFLUSH_MONITOR in mwait_idle_with_hints() and prefer_mwait_c1_over_halt()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is removing unnecessary memory barriers (mb() calls) that were incorrectly added 12 years ago based on erroneous Intel documentation. The commit is a performance optimization/cleanup, not a security fix.
  Key evidence from the code changes:
  1. The CLFLUSH instruction itself (the actual hardware workaround for AAI65 errata) remains in place - only the surrounding memory barriers are removed
  2. The commit message explicitly states Intel later corrected their documentation to clarify that CLFLUSH is already ordered with respect to other operations, making the barriers unnecessary
  3. The changes are purely removing performance overhead (mb() calls) that were never actually required for correctness or security
  4. No vulnerability is being introduced or fixed - this is cleaning up overly conservative code based on incorrect documentation
  This is similar to the "NO CVE" examples like commit 1 which restructured code without security implications, rather than the "YES CVE" examples which fixed actual vulnerabilities like race conditions or memory access issues.
116edfe173d0c tools/x86/kcpuid: Fix error handling
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the specific changes in this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the tool**: `kcpuid` is a userspace diagnostic tool (installed in `/usr/sbin`) that displays CPU feature information. It's not kernel code and doesn't run with elevated privileges beyond what's needed to read CPUID information.
  2. **Type of fix**: The changes are purely about improving error handling and user experience:
     - Replacing `perror()` with `err()/errx()` for better error reporting
     - Redirecting error messages from stdout to stderr (proper practice)
     - Adding proper exit on errors instead of continuing execution
     - Using `warnx()` for warnings
  3. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The original code issues were:
     - Poor error handling that could lead to confusing output
     - Not exiting on malloc/realloc failures (which would likely cause crashes anyway)
     - Error messages going to stdout instead of stderr
     
     None of these constitute security vulnerabilities. At worst, the tool could crash or produce confusing output on allocation failures.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar to commit 1 (CVE Status: NO) which protected against faulty input values in the same tool
     - Unlike commits 2, 3, and 4 (CVE Status: YES) which fixed actual memory corruption issues in kernel code that could be exploited
  5. **Impact**: The tool is a read-only diagnostic utility that parses CPUID data and a CSV file. Even with the poor error handling, there's no privilege escalation, memory corruption exploitation, or other security impact possible.
  This is a code quality improvement, not a security fix.
9126d2754c5e5 gfs2: Don't clear sb->s_fs_info in gfs2_sys_fs_add
- [sasha] Now I understand the full issue. Let me verify the call chain:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability and should be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that can crash the kernel when mounting a GFS2 filesystem fails in a specific way.
  2. **Vulnerability Details**: 
     - When `gfs2_sys_fs_add()` fails during filesystem mount, it was setting `sb->s_fs_info = NULL`
     - After the ae9f3bd8259a commit introduced `sdp->sd_inode`, the error path calls `iput(sdp->sd_inode)` 
     - This triggers `gfs2_drop_inode()` which calls `GFS2_SB(inode)` to get the sdp
     - Since `sb->s_fs_info` was set to NULL, `GFS2_SB(inode)` returns NULL
     - Line 1024 then dereferences NULL: `sdp->sd_flags` causing a kernel crash
  3. **Attack Vector**: An attacker could trigger this by causing the filesystem mount to fail at the right point (e.g., through resource exhaustion or specific mount parameters).
  4. **Similar to CVE Patterns**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits that were assigned CVEs - it's a NULL pointer dereference in filesystem code that can cause kernel crashes.
  The fix properly moves the `sb->s_fs_info = NULL` assignment to `free_sbd()` where it belongs, ensuring the pointer is only cleared when the structure is actually being freed, preventing the NULL dereference during error cleanup.
5c78e793f7873 overflow: Introduce __DEFINE_FLEX for having no initializer
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit introduces a new macro `__DEFINE_FLEX()` to provide flexibility in initialization patterns. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability but rather adds a new API feature.
  2. **Not a Regression**: While the commit fixes a previous change (47e36ed78406), the "fix" is about restoring functionality for a proposed patch that hasn't even been merged yet. The commit message explicitly states: "While not yet in the tree, there is a proposed patch[1] that was depending on the prior behavior of _DEFINE_FLEX".
  3. **API Addition, Not Security Fix**: The change adds `__DEFINE_FLEX()` as a new macro variant that allows omitting initializers. This is purely an API enhancement to support different use cases, particularly for code that wants to use attributes like `__uninitialized`.
  4. **Security-Neutral Change**: The code maintains all the same compile-time safety checks (`_Static_assert` for constant count) and the same underlying implementation pattern. It just provides more flexibility in how the union can be initialized or left uninitialized.
  5. **Similar Historical Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them received CVEs. They all involve API improvements, helper additions, or code refactoring without fixing actual security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a feature addition that provides more flexibility for developers, not a security fix. CVEs are assigned to vulnerabilities that have been fixed, not to new features or API enhancements.
d3faab9b5a6a0 net: usb: aqc111: debug info before sanitation
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE assignment. It is a debugging improvement that reorders the debug output to show the original return value before sanitization. The security fix from commit 405b0d610745 remains fully intact - the error sanitization still occurs and prevents uninitialized memory usage. The change only affects what value is logged in kernel debug messages (showing actual bytes read vs sanitized error code), which provides better debugging information without exposing any sensitive data or creating new vulnerabilities.
662a9ece32add usb: misc: onboard_usb_dev: fix build warning for CONFIG_USB_ONBOARD_DEV_USB5744=n
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is purely a build warning fix that addresses unused function warnings when `CONFIG_USB_ONBOARD_DEV_USB5744=n`. The commit simply moves the `#ifdef` preprocessor directive to encompass the helper functions that are only used when the USB5744 support is enabled.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The code changes do not fix any security vulnerability. They only fix compiler warnings about unused static functions:
     - `onboard_dev_5744_i2c_read_byte()`
     - `onboard_dev_5744_i2c_write_byte()`
  3. **No functional change**: When `CONFIG_USB_ONBOARD_DEV_USB5744` is enabled, the code behaves exactly the same before and after this patch. When disabled, the only difference is that the unused functions are no longer compiled, eliminating the warnings.
  4. **Similar to commit 1**: This is very similar to the first reference commit (commit 130eac4170859) which also dealt with fixing unused function warnings by adjusting preprocessor conditionals and was marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  5. **No exploitable condition**: The unused functions don't create any security risk - they simply generate build warnings when compiled with `-Werror=unused-function`. There's no memory corruption, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed.
  The commit is a clean-up/build fix that improves code quality but does not address any security vulnerability.
9cfdd7752ba5f regulator: dt-bindings: mt6357: Drop fixed compatible requirement
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and its context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a documentation-only change that updates device tree bindings to match the actual device tree usage. The key points:
  1. **No security impact**: This change only modifies documentation/schema files (`Documentation/devicetree/bindings/`), not any functional code that could introduce vulnerabilities.
  2. **Fixing binding validation errors**: The commit fixes inconsistencies between the dt-binding schema and actual device tree usage, resolving validation errors that were introduced by a previous commit.
  3. **No functional change**: The MT6357 regulators are handled by a single driver (`mt6357-regulator`) instantiated through MFD, and the `regulator-fixed` compatibles were never actually used by the driver - they were incorrectly specified in the bindings.
  4. **Similar to historical commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve removing deprecated `regulator-compatible` properties from device trees, which are cosmetic/documentation fixes with no security implications.
  5. **Pure cleanup**: This is purely a cleanup to align the bindings with actual implementation and fix DT validation errors, with no impact on system behavior, security boundaries, or access controls.
  The change simply updates the YAML schema from referencing `fixed-regulator.yaml#` to `regulator.yaml#` for certain LDO entries, removing an incorrect requirement that was causing validation failures.
290da20e33395 do_move_mount(): split the checks in subtree-of-our-ns and entire-anon cases
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit primarily refactors and clarifies security checks in `do_move_mount()` by separating two distinct cases - moving subtrees within the caller's namespace versus moving entire anonymous namespaces. While it mentions fixing "breakage in anon-to-anon case", this appears to be a logic/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The changes show that the commit is reorganizing existing permission checks to be clearer and more correct. The key security checks are preserved:
     - For regular mounts: must be in caller's namespace, detachable from parent
     - For anonymous namespace roots: proper permission checks via `may_use_mount()`
     - Prevention of moving to the same namespace
  3. **Type of breakage**: The "breakage" mentioned appears to be incorrect handling of edge cases when moving anonymous mount namespaces to other anonymous namespaces, but there's no indication this allowed privilege escalation or bypassing of security policies.
  4. **Code changes**: The diff shows the commit moves the `may_use_mount(p)` check to the appropriate branch (anonymous namespace case) and adds proper validation for both cases. This is a correctness fix that ensures the security model works as intended.
  5. **Comparison with similar CVE commits**: Unlike the similar commits shown that were assigned CVEs (which fixed race conditions, UAF vulnerabilities, or security bypasses), this commit fixes logic flow issues without exposing any exploitable security vulnerability.
  The commit improves code clarity and fixes edge case handling but does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
3cae906e1a618 calipso: unlock rcu before returning -EAFNOSUPPORT
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a simple coding error where the previous security fix (commit 6e9f2df1c550) introduced an RCU lock leak in an error path. The code was returning directly with `return -EAFNOSUPPORT` at line 1169 without properly calling `rcu_read_unlock()`, which was acquired at line 1140.
  2. **Security impact**: This is not a security vulnerability but rather a correctness issue:
     - RCU lock leaks don't directly enable privilege escalation, data disclosure, or denial of service
     - It's a resource leak that could potentially cause warnings or affect system stability if triggered repeatedly, but it doesn't create an exploitable security condition
     - The error path is only triggered when there's a mismatch between socket family and address family, which is an invalid operation that would be rejected anyway
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - The similar CVE-assigned commits (1-3) all fixed actual security vulnerabilities:
       - Commits 1-2: Fixed NULL pointer dereferences that could crash the system
       - Commit 3: Fixed a memory leak that could be exploited for resource exhaustion
     - This commit merely fixes an RCU lock leak in an error handling path, which is a programming error but not a security vulnerability
  4. **Code change analysis**: The fix simply changes from a direct return to using the proper cleanup path (`goto conn_setattr_return`), ensuring `rcu_read_unlock()` is called before returning the error.
  This is a typical bug fix for a coding mistake introduced in a previous patch, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
86c48271e0d60 x86/hyperv: Fix APIC ID and VP index confusion in hv_snp_boot_ap()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine if this is a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Functional Impact Only**: The bug causes application processors (APs) to hang during boot when the APIC ID doesn't match the VP index. This results in a system initialization failure, not a security compromise.
  2. **Limited Scope**: The bug only affects:
     - AMD SEV-SNP guests running under Hyper-V
     - Systems where APIC IDs don't match VP indices
     - Only during CPU initialization at boot time
  3. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The code changes show:
     - The fix properly converts APIC ID to VP index using `hv_apicid_to_vp_index()`
     - When the wrong index is used, the hypercall fails cleanly with error handling
     - The failure is logged and the VMSA is properly cleaned up
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure occurs
  4. **Denial of Service Assessment**: While hung APs could be considered a form of DoS, this occurs only at boot time and results in a non-functional system rather than a runtime attack vector. The system simply fails to boot properly with some CPUs unavailable.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: The similar commits shown (fixing AP booting issues, SNP system configurations) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they address functional correctness rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is important for system functionality but does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
8b68e978718f1 x86/iopl: Cure TIF_IO_BITMAP inconsistencies
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes and commit message:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in `tss_update_io_bitmap()`. When a task has `TIF_IO_BITMAP` set but `t->io_bitmap` is NULL, accessing `iobm->sequence` at line 477 (before the fix) would cause a kernel crash.
  2. **Security Impact**: This is a kernel crash that can be triggered under specific conditions:
     - When a kernel thread is created in the context of a user space thread that has TIF_IO_BITMAP set
     - During cleanup of a failed fork operation
     
  3. **Exploitability**: While the conditions are specific, they can potentially be triggered by unprivileged users through:
     - Creating processes with IO bitmap permissions (via ioperm/iopl system calls)
     - Triggering fork failures or kernel thread creation in specific contexts
  4. **Fix Pattern**: The commit adds:
     - A NULL pointer check with `WARN_ON_ONCE(!iobm)` to prevent the crash
     - Proper cleanup of `TIF_IO_BITMAP` flag in `copy_thread()`
     - A check in `io_bitmap_exit()` to avoid TSS updates on non-current tasks
  5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 4 (io_uring fail cancellation) was assigned a CVE for a similar crash/warning scenario
     - Commit 5 (iommufd shift-out-of-bounds) was assigned a CVE for undefined behavior that could crash
  This vulnerability allows local unprivileged users to crash the kernel, which constitutes a denial of service attack vector. The fix is marked for stable kernels with `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`, indicating it's considered a security-relevant issue that needs backporting.
7f9bbc1140ff8 xen/arm: call uaccess_ttbr0_enable for dm_op hypercall
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Functional bug, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a functional failure where dm_op hypercalls fail on ARM64 systems with CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN enabled. This causes device emulation and IOREQ operations to fail, but it's not a security vulnerability - it's a denial of functionality.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The fix doesn't address any security boundary violations, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security issues. It simply ensures that legitimate hypercalls can access userspace buffers as intended.
  3. **Maintains existing security**: The fix actually preserves the security benefits of PAN (Privileged Access Never) by properly enabling/disabling TTBR0 access only during the hypercall execution, similar to how privcmd_call has worked since 2016.
  4. **Failure mode is safe**: Without this fix, dm_op hypercalls simply fail - they don't expose kernel memory, allow unauthorized access, or create any security holes. The failure prevents functionality but doesn't compromise security.
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the functional fixes (like Similar Commits 1-4) received CVEs. Only Similar Commit 5, which addresses speculative execution vulnerabilities (XSA-466 / CVE-2024-53241), received a CVE because it fixed an actual security vulnerability.
  The code changes show this is purely about enabling necessary functionality (temporary user memory access during hypercalls) that was inadvertently broken by a security feature, not about fixing a security vulnerability itself.
23be716b1c4f3 xfs: don't assume perags are initialised when trimming AGs
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  After examining the commit, I need to determine if this should be assigned a CVE. Let me analyze the key aspects:
  **What the bug does:**
  1. The bug occurs when running `fstrim` immediately after mounting a V4 XFS filesystem
  2. The code incorrectly assumes `pag->pagf_longest` is initialized when setting up the trim cursor
  3. On a clean mount (without reading AGF), `pag->pagf_longest` is 0
  4. This causes the free extent search to start at the wrong end of the by-size btree
  5. The result is that fstrim only trims the first extent in each AG instead of all free space
  **Security Impact Analysis:**
  1. **Data confidentiality**: No impact - this doesn't expose any data
  2. **Data integrity**: No impact - this doesn't corrupt or modify any data
  3. **Availability**: Minimal impact - the fstrim operation completes but doesn't fully trim the filesystem
  4. **Resource consumption**: No impact - it actually does LESS work than intended
  5. **Privilege escalation**: No impact - requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run fstrim anyway
  **Functionality Impact:**
  - This is a functional bug that causes fstrim to not work correctly on first run
  - Running fstrim a second time works correctly (because AGF is then read)
  - The bug only affects the trimming/discard functionality, not normal filesystem operations
  - No data loss or corruption occurs
  **CVE Criteria Assessment:**
  - This is not a security vulnerability
  - It's a functional bug that causes reduced functionality (incomplete trimming)
  - There's no security boundary crossed
  - No attacker advantage can be gained from this bug
  - The worst outcome is that some free space isn't discarded when expected
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. This is a functional bug in the fstrim operation that causes it to incompletely trim free space on the first run after mounting a V4 XFS filesystem. While this is a legitimate bug that needs fixing, it has no security implications. The bug simply causes the trim operation to do less work than expected, completing after trimming only the first extent in each allocation group instead of all free extents. There is no data exposure, corruption, denial of service, or any other security impact from this issue.
c98cc9797b700 ring-buffer: Move cpus_read_lock() outside of buffer->mutex
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a circular locking dependency (deadlock) issue in the ring buffer code. While it is a bug fix, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The deadlock occurs in kernel space between internal kernel locks (`buffer->mutex`, `cpu_buffer->mapping_lock`, `cpu_hotplug_lock`). This is a kernel-internal locking issue.
  2. **Requires Privileged Access**: The trace_pipe_raw file that triggers this via mmap is created with mode 0440 (TRACE_MODE_READ), meaning it requires root or specific group access to the tracefs filesystem. Regular unprivileged users cannot trigger this.
  3. **Availability Impact Only**: Even if triggered, this results in a deadlock warning from lockdep, not a security vulnerability like privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption. The system continues to function, though the specific operation may hang.
  4. **Development/Debug Feature**: The issue was discovered using a modified trace-cmd with special options (`--nosplice`), indicating this is more of a development/debugging scenario rather than a typical production use case.
  The commit is fixing a quality/reliability issue in the kernel's tracing infrastructure, not a security vulnerability. Similar commits in the reference set that were marked "CVE Status: NO" also involved fixing deadlocks or circular locking dependencies without security implications.
40ee2afafc1d9 ring-buffer: Fix buffer locking in ring_buffer_subbuf_order_set()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Race Condition with Security Impact**: The fix addresses a critical locking issue where the mutex was released too early (via `mutex_unlock()`) in the error path. The fix uses `guard(mutex)` to ensure the mutex is held throughout the entire function, including error handling.
  2. **List Corruption Vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly mentions "preventing list corruption and other concurrency-related issues." In the error path, the code performs list operations (`list_for_each_entry_safe`, `list_del_init`) on `cpu_buffer->new_pages` without holding the mutex, allowing concurrent access that can corrupt kernel data structures.
  3. **Syzbot Detection**: This was found by syzbot, Google's kernel fuzzer, which indicates it's a real, reproducible issue. Syzbot specifically targets security-relevant bugs.
  4. **Similar to CVE-Assigned Commits**: This follows patterns similar to the provided examples:
     - Like the ring-buffer reader locking fixes (CVE assigned), this fixes improper synchronization
     - It involves memory management and list operations under improper locking
     - Can lead to kernel memory corruption
  5. **Attack Surface**: While it requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to trigger (via tracing subsystem), it still represents a security boundary violation where privileged users could potentially corrupt kernel memory, leading to:
     - Kernel crashes (DoS)
     - Potential privilege escalation through memory corruption
     - Data integrity issues in the tracing subsystem
  The key vulnerability is in the error handling path where the mutex is released before cleaning up allocated pages, creating a window for concurrent threads to access and modify the same data structures, leading to list corruption and potential use-after-free conditions.
4fc78a7c9ca99 ring-buffer: Do not trigger WARN_ON() due to a commit_overrun
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a false positive WARN_ON() trigger, not a security vulnerability. The WARN_ON() was incorrectly firing in a legitimate scenario (commit_overrun) where an interrupt fills the buffer while an event is being written.
  2. **No Impact on System Security**: The issue only causes:
     - A kernel warning message to be printed
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond the warning itself
  3. **Legitimate Race Condition Handling**: The code changes show this is fixing incorrect assumption handling rather than a security flaw. The commit refactors the logic to:
     - Check if missed_events exists first
     - Then differentiate between normal missed events and commit_overrun scenarios
     - Replace the unconditional WARN_ON_ONCE with a conditional one that excludes the legitimate commit_overrun case
  4. **Diagnostic Issue Only**: The commit message clearly states this is about differentiating a legitimate scenario (commit_overrun) from an error condition. The fix adds proper detection logic and informational logging (`pr_info()`) instead of triggering a warning.
  5. **No Security Boundaries Crossed**: This is internal ring buffer accounting logic for tracing infrastructure. The issue doesn't allow crossing any security boundaries or accessing protected resources.
  The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involved actual security issues like:
  - Buffer overflows/out-of-bounds reads
  - Race conditions leading to memory corruption
  - Data structure corruption
  This commit only fixes incorrect warning logic with no security implications.
25b065a744ff0 mm/filemap: use filemap_end_dropbehind() for read invalidation
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a critical race condition that could lead to data loss. The issue is a classic Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where:
  1. The original code checked if a folio was dirty or under writeback
  2. Then acquired the folio lock
  3. Then called `folio_unmap_invalidate()` directly WITHOUT rechecking the folio state
  Between steps 2 and 3, the folio could have been redirtied or marked for writeback by another thread. The fix properly uses `filemap_end_dropbehind()` which rechecks these conditions AFTER acquiring the lock:
  ```c
  if (mapping && !folio_test_writeback(folio) && !folio_test_dirty(folio))
      folio_unmap_invalidate(mapping, folio, 0);
  ```
  This race condition could result in invalidating folios containing dirty data or data being written back, causing permanent data loss. This is a security-relevant data integrity issue that warrants CVE assignment.
095f627add86a mm/filemap: gate dropbehind invalidate on folio !dirty && !writeback
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to provide the final answer:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes fix a race condition in the dropbehind feature that could cause incorrect behavior, but it does not represent a security vulnerability:
  1. **No data corruption risk**: The `folio_unmap_invalidate()` function already has built-in safeguards (lines 614-615 in truncate.c) that check if the folio is dirty and return `-EBUSY` without proceeding with invalidation.
  2. **No security boundary violations**: The RWF_DONTCACHE feature that uses dropbehind requires valid file permissions and operates within normal user privileges.
  3. **Limited impact**: The worst case is that an invalidation attempt fails when it shouldn't, which is a correctness issue rather than a security issue.
  4. **The fix adds defensive checks**: The new `filemap_end_dropbehind()` function adds checks for `!folio_test_writeback(folio) && !folio_test_dirty(folio)` before calling `folio_unmap_invalidate()`, preventing unnecessary invalidation attempts on dirty or writeback folios.
  This is similar to the referenced commit 1 (ext4 redundant wait removal) which was marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a code cleanup/correctness fix without security implications.
3b5260d12b1fe Don't propagate mounts into detached trees
- [sasha] Now I understand the context better. Let me analyze the actual changes in the commit:
  Based on my analysis of the commit "Don't propagate mounts into detached trees", here's my assessment:
  **CVE Status: NO**
  **Explanation:**
  This commit is a **functionality fix** that addresses a userland regression, not a security vulnerability. Here are the key points:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit reverts behavior introduced in kernel 6.15-rc1 that caused mount events to propagate into detached mount trees (anonymous namespaces). This was a change from the long-standing behavior (up to 6.14) where mount propagation did not occur into detached trees.
  2. **Regression, not vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states this caused "userland regressions" - meaning it broke expected functionality for user applications, not that it introduced a security hole.
  3. **Code changes analysis**:
     - Removes the `MNTNS_PROPAGATING` flag from `struct mnt_namespace`
     - Changes the check in `propagate_one()` from `if (m->mnt_ns->mntns_flags & MNTNS_PROPAGATING)` to `if (is_anon_ns(m->mnt_ns))` 
     - Removes logic that temporarily set/cleared the `MNTNS_PROPAGATING` flag during mount moves
  4. **No security boundaries crossed**: The changes don't fix any privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service issues. They simply restore the expected mount propagation behavior that userspace applications depend on.
  5. **Similar commits context**: The referenced similar commits (hostfs filesystem changes, listmount fix, EFS mount API) are all marked as "CVE Status: NO" and are similarly functional fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a behavioral correction to maintain API compatibility, not a security fix. While mount namespace handling is security-sensitive, this particular change addresses functional correctness rather than a security vulnerability.
03ddd7725ed1b 9p: Add a migrate_folio method
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a functional regression, not a security vulnerability. The commit adds back a missing `migrate_folio` method to the 9p filesystem's address space operations that was inadvertently removed when switching to netfslib.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The absence of the `migrate_folio` method means dirty 9p folios cannot be migrated during memory defragmentation
     - This affects memory management efficiency but does not create any security vulnerabilities
     - No data corruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access is possible
  3. **Code changes**:
     - The fix simply adds `.migrate_folio = filemap_migrate_folio,` to the `v9fs_addr_operations` structure
     - `filemap_migrate_folio` is a standard kernel function that safely migrates page cache pages
     - This is a straightforward restoration of missing functionality
  4. **Comparison to similar commits**: The similar commits analyzed (commits 1-5) all deal with migration functionality and none were assigned CVEs. They handle complex migration logic, error conditions, and performance optimizations - but these are not security issues.
  5. **No security boundary crossed**: The issue only affects performance (memory defragmentation success rate) and does not cross any security boundaries or expose sensitive information.
  This is a functional fix for a regression that impacts system performance, not a security vulnerability fix.
324d45e53f1a3 usb: typec: tcpm: move tcpm_queue_vdm_unlocked to asynchronous work
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Deadlock, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a deadlock condition between the TCPM (Type-C Port Manager) and the DisplayPort Alt Mode driver. Deadlocks are typically availability issues rather than security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data exposure.
  2. **Race condition in locking**: The issue is a race condition where:
     - The Alt Mode driver checks if TCPM is in a ready state without holding a lock
     - TCPM then grabs the lock and changes state
     - Alt Mode driver tries to grab the same lock, causing deadlock
     
  3. **Similar commits without CVEs**: Looking at the historical context, similar deadlock fixes in the same subsystem (e.g., commit b791a67f6812 "usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix potential deadlock") were not assigned CVEs. These were treated as regular bug fixes.
  4. **No security impact**: The deadlock would cause the USB Type-C functionality to hang, but it doesn't:
     - Allow unauthorized access to system resources
     - Enable privilege escalation
     - Expose sensitive data
     - Allow remote exploitation
  5. **Local DoS at most**: While the deadlock could be considered a local denial of service, it requires physical access to USB Type-C ports and specific timing conditions. This is generally not considered CVE-worthy unless it can be triggered remotely or has broader system impact.
  The fix properly addresses the race condition by moving the state check and VDM queueing to an asynchronous work queue, ensuring the locks are acquired in the correct order.
0736299d090f5 usb: typec: tcpm/tcpci_maxim: Fix bounds check in process_rx()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a bounds check issue in the USB Type-C Power Delivery message processing code, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **No Memory Corruption**: The bug does not cause any buffer overflow, out-of-bounds read/write, or memory corruption. The rx_buf is sized at 32 bytes (TCPC_RECEIVE_BUFFER_LEN), and even with the incorrect bounds check, the maximum read is still 32 bytes (count=31, then count+=1 becomes 32), which fits within the allocated buffer.
  2. **Functional Issue Only**: The bug causes false rejection of valid maximum-size PD messages. When a PD message is exactly 30 bytes (the maximum size of struct pd_message), plus 1 byte for frame type, totaling 31 bytes, the old check would incorrectly reject it because `count > sizeof(struct pd_message)` would evaluate to `31 > 30`, which is true.
  3. **No Security Impact**: The issue simply causes valid messages to be dropped with an error log. There's no way for an attacker to exploit this to:
     - Execute arbitrary code
     - Access unauthorized data
     - Cause system crashes or denial of service
     - Bypass security controls
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 3" which were marked as NO CVE - they fix functional bugs in the USB Type-C subsystem without security implications.
  The commit message correctly identifies this as a "bounds check" fix, but it's fixing an overly restrictive check that causes functionality issues, not a security vulnerability where the check was too permissive.
89bb3dc13ac29 usb: Flush altsetting 0 endpoints before reinitializating them after reset.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, I can now make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It fixes a functional bug related to the order of operations during USB device reset. The issue is:
  1. **The bug**: When resetting USB devices, the kernel was calling `usb_hcd_alloc_bandwidth()` (which allocates new ring buffers) before calling `usb_disable_interface()` (which flushes old URBs). This caused the host driver to try to find and remove stale URBs from freshly allocated ring buffers.
  2. **Not a security issue**: This is purely a correctness/functionality issue that could cause operational problems but does not introduce any security vulnerabilities:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - No privilege escalation possibilities
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond normal device malfunction
     - The issue only affects the proper cleanup and reinitialization of USB endpoints during device reset
  3. **Nature of fix**: The fix simply reorders operations to flush old URBs before allocating new ring buffers, ensuring proper cleanup sequence. This is a logical ordering fix, not a security fix.
  The commit is similar to the referenced commits (#1-4) which also deal with USB device initialization, configuration, and error handling without security implications. Unlike commit #5 which fixed a NULL pointer dereference (potential DoS), this commit addresses a benign ordering issue.
2852788cfbe9c usb: cdnsp: Fix issue with detecting USB 3.2 speed
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The change fixes a functionality issue where the driver failed to properly detect USB 3.2 SuperSpeedPlus Gen1 x2 and Gen2 x2 speeds. The code changes simply add additional speed detection conditions to the `cdnsp_port_speed()` function:
  ```c
  -	if (DEV_SUPERSPEEDPLUS(port_status))
  +	if (DEV_SUPERSPEEDPLUS(port_status) ||
  +	    DEV_SSP_GEN1x2(port_status) || DEV_SSP_GEN2x2(port_status))
   		return USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS;
  ```
  This is a pure functionality fix with no security implications:
  1. It doesn't affect memory safety - no buffer overflows or use-after-free issues
  2. It doesn't cross privilege boundaries or enable privilege escalation
  3. It doesn't expose sensitive information
  4. The worst impact is devices not being recognized at their proper speed, which is a compatibility/performance issue rather than a security vulnerability
  The commit is correctly marked for stable backporting due to its functional importance, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
f4ecdc352646f usb: cdnsp: Fix issue with detecting command completion event
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now make a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Timing/race condition, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a timing issue where there's a small gap between when `CMD_RING_BUSY` is cleared by the controller and when the command completion event is added to the event ring. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue causes the driver to incorrectly return an error code when the command actually completed successfully. This leads to functional problems (failed USB tests) but does not create any security risks such as:
     - Memory corruption
     - Information disclosure
     - Privilege escalation
     - Denial of service beyond normal device malfunction
  3. **Limited scope**: The bug manifests during specific USB test scenarios (usbtest driver test 9) and results in false error reporting rather than any exploitable condition.
  4. **Fix is a retry mechanism**: The fix adds a retry loop with a small delay (20us) to give the controller time to add the completion event. This is a reliability improvement, not a security fix.
  The similar commits provided as context show that functional bugs in the USB controller driver that don't have security implications (Similar Commits 1, 2, and 5) are not assigned CVEs, while those that involve actual security issues like NULL pointer dereferences (Similar Commits 3 and 4) do get CVEs.
1143d41922c0f usb: misc: onboard_usb_dev: Fix usb5744 initialization sequence
- [sasha] Looking at the provided diff, I can see the key changes:
  1. The register address changed from separate bytes (0x41, 0x1D) to a single 16-bit address (0x411D)
  2. The code now implements proper read-modify-write instead of blindly writing
  3. It switches from SMBus block write (which adds a count byte) to raw I2C transfers
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in the USB5744 hub initialization sequence, not a security vulnerability. The issues addressed are:
  1. **Protocol mismatch**: The original code used `i2c_smbus_write_block_data()` which inserts an extra length byte into the data stream, breaking the USB5744's expected protocol format. This is a functional correctness issue.
  2. **Missing read-modify-write**: The original code blindly wrote to a register without preserving reserved bits, which could cause device malfunction but not a security issue.
  3. **Incorrect register addressing**: The register was split into two bytes (0x41, 0x1D) instead of being treated as a 16-bit address (0x411D).
  These are device initialization bugs that would prevent proper USB hub operation or cause unpredictable behavior, but they don't create exploitable security vulnerabilities. The device in question is a USB hub controller accessed via I2C, and the failures would manifest as initialization failures or device malfunction rather than privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security issues.
b495021a973e2 tty: serial: 8250_omap: fix TX with DMA for am33xx
- [sasha] Looking at the commit message and code changes in detail:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in the TX DMA handling for the 8250_omap serial driver, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that transmitted data gets corrupted - specifically, "transmitting N bytes has been seen to result in the last N-1 bytes being sent repeatedly." This is a data corruption issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Root cause**: The bug was introduced when converting from circular buffer (circ_buf) to kfifo. The issue is an off-by-one accounting error where:
     - When OMAP_DMA_TX_KICK is set, a "skip_byte" is pulled from the kfifo
     - The DMA size (dma->tx_size) wasn't decreased to account for this
     - This causes uart_xmit_advance() to advance the kfifo by one too many bytes
  3. **No security impact**: 
     - The bug doesn't allow:
       - Memory corruption or overflow
       - Privilege escalation
       - Information disclosure (it just repeats already-transmitted data)
       - Denial of service beyond normal serial port malfunction
     - It only affects data integrity of serial transmissions on specific hardware (AM33xx with DMA)
  4. **Similar commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided, none of the other serial driver bug fixes were assigned CVEs unless they involved actual security issues like buffer overflows or out-of-bounds access.
  This is a straightforward functional bug fix for incorrect data transmission, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
1bd6406fb5f36 VMCI: fix race between vmci_host_setup_notify and vmci_ctx_unset_notify
- [sasha] Let me analyze the race condition described in the commit message. The issue is that:
  1. CPU0 calls `get_user_pages_fast()` and stores the result directly in `context->notify_page`
  2. During the execution of `get_user_pages_fast()`, specifically in `gup_huge_pmd()`, the page pointer is already stored in `context->notify_page`
  3. CPU1 can see this intermediate state and call `vmci_ctx_unset_notify()` which:
     - Reads `context->notify_page`
     - Calls `put_page()` on it, potentially freeing the page
  4. CPU0 continues in `__gup_longterm_locked()` and tries to access the now-freed page, triggering the warning in `try_grab_folio()`
  The fix is to use a local variable `page` instead of directly storing to `context->notify_page`, only assigning it after `get_user_pages_fast()` completes successfully.
  **CVE Decision: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free vulnerability**: The race condition can lead to a use-after-free scenario where CPU1 frees a page via `put_page()` while CPU0 is still trying to grab references to it in the GUP (get_user_pages) path.
  2. **Memory corruption potential**: The freed page could be reallocated and used for other purposes while the GUP code is still trying to manipulate it, potentially leading to memory corruption.
  3. **Triggered from userspace**: The vulnerability can be triggered through VMCI ioctl operations which are accessible from userspace, making it exploitable by unprivileged users with access to VMCI devices.
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit #2 and #3 ("mm: gup: stop abusing try_grab_folio") were assigned CVEs for fixing race conditions in the GUP path that could lead to warnings and potential memory safety issues. This commit fixes a similar race condition.
  5. **Security impact**: The race condition allows one thread to free memory that another thread is actively trying to pin, which violates memory safety guarantees and could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation or denial of service.
  The fix correctly addresses the issue by ensuring `context->notify_page` is only set after `get_user_pages_fast()` completes successfully, preventing the race window where another CPU could see and free the partially-initialized page reference.
acb3dac2805d3 usb: usbtmc: Fix read_stb function and get_stb ioctl
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to determine if this should be assigned a CVE. Let me analyze the key aspects:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug but does not address a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that after commit cac01bd178d6 changed `usbtmc_get_stb()` to return 0 on success (instead of a positive value), the callers `usbtmc488_ioctl_read_stb()` and the `USBTMC_IOCTL_GET_STB` ioctl handler were still checking for positive return values. This caused these functions to fail silently when they should have succeeded.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The bug causes legitimate operations to fail (denial of functionality)
     - It does NOT cause memory corruption, buffer overflows, or privilege escalation
     - It does NOT leak sensitive information
     - It does NOT allow unauthorized access
  3. **Code changes**:
     - In `usbtmc488_ioctl_read_stb()`: Changed from `if (rv > 0)` to `if (rv < 0) return rv;` - simply fixing the error handling logic
     - In `USBTMC_IOCTL_GET_STB`: Changed from `if (retval > 0)` to `if (!retval)` - fixing the success condition check
  4. **Security implications**: None. The USBTMC (USB Test & Measurement Class) driver is used for communicating with test equipment. The STB (Status Byte) operations are standard protocol operations that were simply broken due to incorrect return value checking. When broken, they would fail to return status information to userspace, but this doesn't create any security vulnerability.
  This is a pure functionality fix that restores broken ioctl operations, similar to the "usb: typec: tcpm/tcpci_maxim: fix error code" commit in the examples which was marked as NO CVE.
fe8abdd175d7b nvmem: zynqmp_nvmem: unbreak driver after cleanup
- [sasha] Perfect! This confirms the issue. The nvmem core copies `config->priv` to `nvmem->priv`, and then passes `nvmem->priv` as the context parameter to the read/write callbacks.
  Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that causes a kernel crash when the nvmem device is accessed. The specific issue:
  1. The cleanup commit (29be47fcd6a0) removed the line `econfig.priv = priv;` from the probe function
  2. Without setting `econfig.priv`, it remains NULL
  3. The nvmem core copies this NULL value to `nvmem->priv` 
  4. When read/write operations are performed, the nvmem core passes `nvmem->priv` (which is NULL) as the `context` parameter to `zynqmp_nvmem_read()` and `zynqmp_efuse_access()`
  5. These functions immediately dereference the NULL pointer:
     - `struct device *dev = context;` (line 63, 148)
     - `dev_err(dev, ...)` calls (lines 73, 78, 87, 93)
     - `dma_alloc_coherent(dev, ...)` call (line 98)
  This is a classic NULL pointer dereference that would cause a kernel crash when any userspace application tries to read from or write to the nvmem device. The pattern is identical to the similar CVE commits shown in the examples - missing driver data initialization leading to NULL pointer dereferences in device callbacks.
f90fff1e152de posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a race condition that could cause incorrect behavior in the POSIX CPU timer subsystem, but it does not represent a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The race condition occurs when a task is exiting and has passed `exit_notify()` (setting `tsk->exit_state = EXIT_ZOMBIE`), but `handle_posix_cpu_timers()` runs from an IRQ context. If the task gets reaped by its parent at that moment, `posix_cpu_timer_del()` might fail to detect that `timer->it.cpu.firing != 0`.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The consequence is that timer deletion might not work correctly for an already-exiting process. This is a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability because:
     - It only affects timer cleanup for tasks that are already exiting
     - It doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - It doesn't allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause denial of service
     - The WARN_ON_ONCE in the code (line 494) indicates this is an unexpected but handled condition
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: The similar commits provided (commits 1-5) all have "CVE Status: NO" and deal with:
     - Signal delivery optimization (commit 1)
     - CPU idle state fixes (commit 2)  
     - Test improvements (commit 3)
     - RCU synchronization changes (commit 4)
     - Performance optimizations (commit 5)
  None of these were assigned CVEs despite fixing various race conditions and synchronization issues.
  4. **The fix**: The change simply adds an `exit_state` check to prevent the race - a defensive programming practice that ensures proper cleanup but doesn't close a security hole.
  This is a bug fix for a corner case in timer handling during process exit, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
93bd4a80efeb5 powerpc/kernel: Fix ppc_save_regs inclusion in build
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. The commit is fixing a build break where `ppc_save_regs` is needed by:
  1. `CONFIG_PPC64` code (in irq_64.c)
  2. `CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP` code (in kexec.h for crash_setup_regs)
  3. But was only being built when `CONFIG_XMON`, `CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE`, or `CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3S` were enabled
  **CVE Status: NO**
  **Explanation:**
  This commit is a build fix that addresses a configuration-dependent build failure. It does not fix a security vulnerability but rather ensures that `ppc_save_regs.o` is always built since it's now required by code paths that don't depend on XMON, KEXEC_CORE, or PPC_BOOK3S configurations. 
  The issue is purely a compile-time dependency problem where certain kernel configurations would fail to build because `ppc_save_regs` was referenced but not compiled. This is a build system fix, not a security fix. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant behavior being addressed.
fe7f7ac8e0c70 HID: usbhid: Eliminate recurrent out-of-bounds bug in usbhid_parse()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a recurrent out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `usbhid_parse()`. The commit message explicitly states it "Eliminates recurrent out-of-bounds bug", indicating this is a security issue that wasn't fully resolved by the previous fix (f043bfc98c19).
  2. **Attack Vector**: A malicious USB HID device can provide crafted HID descriptors that trigger out-of-bounds reads in the kernel. The syzbot report (syzbot+c52569baf0c843f35495@syzkaller.appspotmail.com) confirms this is an exploitable issue.
  3. **Incomplete Previous Fix**: The original fix (f043bfc98c19) added bounds checking but still had issues:
     - It still used a for loop that could access `hdesc->desc[n]` beyond the allocated memory
     - The validation `(hdesc->bLength - offset) / sizeof(struct hid_class_descriptor)` could still allow out-of-bounds access due to the way the structure was defined with `desc[1]`
  4. **Root Cause Fix**: This commit properly addresses the vulnerability by:
     - Restructuring the HID descriptor to separate mandatory (`rpt_desc`) and optional (`opt_descs[]`) descriptors
     - Eliminating the for loop entirely for the mandatory report descriptor
     - Adding stricter validation: `hdesc->bLength != sizeof(*hdesc) + (hdesc->bNumDescriptors - 1) * sizeof(*hcdesc)`
  5. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The similar commits shown (CVE-assigned) demonstrate that out-of-bounds reads in USB/HID parsing code are consistently assigned CVEs due to their security impact.
  The vulnerability allows a physically present attacker with a malicious USB device to trigger kernel memory disclosure or potentially cause denial of service through crafted HID descriptors.
6a3439a417b91 ALSA: usb-audio: Add implicit feedback quirk for RODE AI-1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the similar historical commits provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a hardware quirk that fixes audio playback functionality for the RODE AI-1 USB audio interface. The commit message clearly states "the device receives audio data but produces no output" without the quirk - this is a functional issue, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The change simply adds an entry to the `playback_implicit_fb_quirks` table:
     ```c
     IMPLICIT_FB_FIXED_DEV(0x19f7, 0x000a, 0x84, 3), /* RODE AI-1 */
     ```
     This tells the USB audio driver to use endpoint 0x84 on interface 3 for implicit feedback synchronization.
  3. **Hardware-specific functionality fix**: Implicit feedback is a USB audio synchronization mechanism where the device uses a capture endpoint to provide timing feedback for playback. Without proper implicit feedback setup, some USB audio devices don't work correctly (no audio output), but this doesn't create any security risks.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: All the provided similar commits (Yamaha THR5, RME Digiface USB, various other audio devices) that add implicit feedback quirks are marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the exact same pattern.
  5. **No exploitation potential**: There's no buffer overflow, memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed. It's purely a device compatibility fix.
  The commit is a typical USB audio device quirk that enables proper audio playback on specific hardware by configuring the correct synchronization endpoints.
0718a78f6a9f0 ALSA: usb-audio: Kill timer properly at removal
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a timer use-after-free vulnerability. The `error_timer` can remain active after the `umidi` object is freed via `snd_usbmidi_free()`, leading to a kernel warning (as mentioned in the commit message) and potentially more severe consequences.
  2. **Security Impact**: When the timer fires after the umidi object is freed, the timer callback `snd_usbmidi_error_timer()` will access freed memory through `from_timer(umidi, t, error_timer)`, which is a classic use-after-free vulnerability.
  3. **Similar CVE Patterns**: The similar commits shown (especially the ALSA caiaq commits) that received CVEs also deal with proper cleanup during disconnection to prevent use-after-free scenarios. This follows the same pattern of fixing improper resource cleanup that can lead to UAF.
  4. **Attack Vector**: While the commit mentions "in a rare case", the fact that it was found by a fuzzer (syzbot) indicates it's reachable through malicious or malformed USB device interactions, making it a potential security issue.
  5. **Fix Pattern**: The fix adds `timer_shutdown_sync()` in both the disconnect path and the free path, ensuring the timer is properly killed before the memory is freed. This is a clear security fix preventing access to freed memory.
  The vulnerability allows a malicious USB device or a local attacker with USB access to potentially trigger a use-after-free condition in the kernel, which could lead to kernel crashes or potentially privilege escalation.
570896604f47d Revert "wifi: mwifiex: Fix HT40 bandwidth issue."
- [sasha] Let me analyze based on what I have:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The revert addresses a functional regression (packet loss in HT40 mode), not a security vulnerability. The commit message explicitly states "received packets are lost" which is a functionality/performance issue, not a security issue.
  2. **No security implications in the code**: The code change being reverted only modified how the radio_type field is set for 40MHz bandwidth configuration:
     - The original code added: `chan_list->chan_scan_param[0].radio_type |= CHAN_BW_40MHZ << 2;`
     - This is purely a configuration change for wireless bandwidth settings
  3. **Impact is limited to performance**: The issue manifests as packet loss when HT40 mode is enabled, which affects network performance but doesn't create any security vulnerabilities like:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No unauthorized access
     - No information disclosure
     - No buffer overflows
  4. **Original change was an optimization**: The commit message notes that the original change was "just a performance optimization" to enable proper 40MHz bandwidth usage.
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): RF calibration data download issue - functional bug
     - Similar Commit 2 (YES CVE): OOB check condition fix - security vulnerability
     - Similar Commit 3 (NO CVE): RF calibration data fix - functional bug
     - Similar Commit 4 (NO CVE): Incorrect indexing - functional bug
     - Similar Commit 5 (NO CVE): Interface type change - functional bug
  This revert follows the pattern of functional bugs (NO CVE) rather than security vulnerabilities (YES CVE).
a298bbab903e3 tools/resolve_btfids: Fix build when cross compiling kernel with clang.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my security assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit is a build system fix for cross-compilation with clang and does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds `CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS=""` to the HOST_OVERRIDES variable, which is purely a build configuration issue. It ensures that when building resolve_btfids (a build-time tool), the cross-compilation flags intended for the target architecture are not incorrectly applied to the host tool.
  2. **What resolve_btfids does**: Based on the code analysis, resolve_btfids is a build-time tool that processes BTF (BPF Type Format) IDs in the kernel binary. It runs during kernel compilation on the host system, not on the target system. It's not a runtime component.
  3. **No security impact**: The issue being fixed only affects whether the kernel can be successfully cross-compiled with clang. When the bug was present, the build would either fail or produce incorrect results during cross-compilation. This is a development/build-time issue, not a runtime security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit is similar in nature to the other build system fixes shown as reference commits (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), such as:
     - The musl libc build fix
     - The userprogs bitsize detection fix
     - The PowerPC vDSO CLANG_FLAGS fix
     
  All of these are build system configuration fixes that ensure proper compilation in various environments.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no code path that could be exploited by an attacker. The fix simply ensures that when cross-compiling with clang, the correct flags are used for building host tools vs target binaries.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves the kernel build system's cross-compilation support, but it does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
eb71feaacaaca rust: list: fix path of `assert_pinned!`
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. The commit is fixing a broken import path. The `assert_pinned!` macro was moved from `$crate` (which would be the kernel crate) to the `pin_init` crate. The change is:
  From: `$crate::assert_pinned!($t, $field, $fty, inline);`
  To: `::pin_init::assert_pinned!($t, $field, $fty, inline);`
  This is a compilation fix - the code wouldn't compile without this change because the macro path is incorrect after the refactoring that moved `assert_pinned!` to the `pin_init` crate.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It fixes a compilation error caused by an incorrect macro path after refactoring. The commit message clearly states this is fixing a path issue that was "missed in the commit above" (referring to commit dbd5058ba60c that moved pin-init to its own crate). The change has no security implications - it's purely a build fix to correct an import path that prevents compilation. Without this fix, any code using this macro rule would fail to compile, but there are no runtime security issues being addressed.
f4daa80d6be7d rust: compile libcore with edition 2024 for 1.87+
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit is a build system adaptation to match Rust 1.87's change of compiling the core library with edition 2024 instead of 2021. It's not fixing a security vulnerability but rather ensuring build compatibility.
  2. **Build-Time Only Change**: The changes are entirely in the build system (Makefile and rust-analyzer configuration script). They affect:
     - Setting the correct `--edition` flag when compiling Rust's core library
     - Updating the rust-analyzer configuration generator to use the correct edition
     - No runtime code changes or security fixes
  3. **Preventive Compatibility Fix**: The commit prevents potential build breakage when using Rust 1.87+ by ensuring the kernel's Rust build system uses the same edition as the upstream Rust compiler expects for the core library.
  4. **No Security Impact**: While Rust edition 2024 does include some security improvements (like stricter `unsafe` handling), this commit is not implementing those security features - it's merely ensuring the build system compatibility. The actual security benefits come from the Rust compiler itself, not from this kernel patch.
  5. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits, they all deal with build system adjustments, configuration updates, and tooling improvements - none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't fix security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is essentially a build configuration update to maintain compatibility with newer Rust toolchain versions, not a security fix.
cbeaa41dfe26b objtool/rust: relax slice condition to cover more `noreturn` Rust functions
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a build-time tooling fix for objtool, not a security vulnerability fix. The change relaxes a pattern matching condition in `is_rust_noreturn()` from:
  ```c
  (strstr(func->name, "_4core5slice5index24slice_") &&
   str_ends_with(func->name, "_fail"));
  ```
  to:
  ```c
  (strstr(func->name, "_4core5slice5index") &&
   strstr(func->name, "slice_") &&
   str_ends_with(func->name, "_fail"));
  ```
  This allows objtool to correctly identify more Rust noreturn functions and avoid false warnings about functions "falling through" to the next function. The issue being fixed is purely a build-time static analysis problem where objtool would emit incorrect warnings like:
  ```
  warning: objtool: funcA() falls through to next function funcB()
  ```
  There is no runtime security impact - this is solely about improving the accuracy of objtool's static analysis for Rust code. All similar objtool-related commits in the reference set were also marked as NO CVE.
11fcf368506d3 uapi: bitops: use UAPI-safe variant of BITS_PER_LONG again
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should **not** be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a correctness fix for UAPI header compatibility, not a security issue. The change fixes incorrect macro behavior when building 32-bit userspace code against 64-bit kernel headers (compat builds).
  2. **Issue scope**: The problem occurs because `BITS_PER_LONG` is derived from kernel configuration while `__BITS_PER_LONG` is derived from the compiler. When building 32-bit compat userspace or vDSO, using `BITS_PER_LONG` would give the wrong value (64 instead of 32), potentially causing incorrect bitmask generation.
  3. **Not exploitable**: While the incorrect masks could cause functional issues in userspace programs that include these headers, there's no security impact demonstrated. The issue would manifest as incorrect behavior in userspace applications, not as a vulnerability that could be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security breaches.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: The similar commits shown (adding bitmap functions, fixing GENMASK macros, updating permission encodings) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are feature additions or correctness fixes without security implications.
  The commit simply ensures that UAPI headers use the correct, compiler-provided bit width definitions rather than kernel configuration values, which is a compatibility and correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
5e223e06ee7c6 block: Fix bvec_set_folio() for very large folios
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Security Vulnerability Pattern**: This commit fixes a silent data truncation vulnerability that occurs when handling very large folios (>4GB). The original `bvec_set_folio()` function accepts `unsigned int` parameters for both `len` and `offset`, which are then passed directly to `bvec_set_page()` using `&folio->page`.
  2. **Critical Security Impact**:
     - When a folio offset exceeds 4GB (UINT_MAX), it gets silently truncated from a large value to a small value
     - As shown in my analysis, an offset of 0x100001000 (just over 4GB) gets truncated to 0x1000 (4KB)
     - This means I/O operations intended for page 1048577 would actually target page 1
     - This can lead to:
       - **Data corruption**: Writing to wrong memory locations
       - **Information disclosure**: Reading from unintended memory locations
       - **System instability**: Corrupting critical kernel data structures
  3. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The similar commits shown (commits 26064d3e2b4d and 38b43539d64b) that fixed folio handling for >4GB were assigned CVEs. They addressed the same class of vulnerability - silent truncation when handling large folios.
  4. **Real-world Impact**: The commit message explicitly states "if we attempt to add a folio that is larger than 4GB, we'll silently truncate the offset and len." The word "silently" is particularly concerning as it means no warnings or errors would alert administrators to data corruption.
  5. **Fix Implementation**: The fix properly handles large folios by:
     - Changing parameters from `unsigned int` to `size_t`
     - Adding `WARN_ON_ONCE(len > UINT_MAX)` to catch problematic cases
     - Properly calculating the page number within the folio using `offset / PAGE_SIZE`
     - Using `folio_page(folio, nr)` instead of `&folio->page` to get the correct page
  This vulnerability could be exploited in systems with large memory configurations where >4GB folios are possible, particularly on architectures like aarch64 with 16GB hugepage support.
f826ec7966a63 bio: Fix bio_first_folio() for SPARSEMEM without VMEMMAP
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes an incorrect offset calculation in `bio_first_folio()` that occurs only in specific kernel configurations (SPARSEMEM enabled without SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP).
  2. **Code change analysis**:
     - Old code: `PAGE_SIZE * (bvec->bv_page - &fi->folio->page)`
     - New code: `PAGE_SIZE * folio_page_idx(fi->folio, bvec->bv_page)`
     
     The old code incorrectly assumes that struct pages are contiguous in memory, which is not true when SPARSEMEM is enabled without VMEMMAP.
  3. **Security impact assessment**:
     - This is a **correctness bug**, not a security vulnerability
     - The incorrect offset calculation would lead to wrong folio offset values in the iterator
     - This affects only iteration logic and doesn't directly lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - The bug is configuration-specific and only affects systems with SPARSEMEM enabled but SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP disabled (a relatively uncommon configuration)
  4. **Comparison with similar CVE-assigned commits**:
     - The referenced CVE commits fixed actual memory safety issues like NULL pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and incorrect page reference counting
     - This commit fixes a logic error in offset calculation that doesn't have direct security implications
  5. **No security indicators**:
     - No mention of security concerns in the commit message
     - No reports from security tools or fuzzing
     - No potential for exploitation or security impact described
  The fix improves correctness for an edge case configuration but doesn't address a security vulnerability.
b64af6bcd3b0f smb: client: fix perf regression with deferred closes
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a performance regression, not a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states "fix perf regression with deferred closes" and describes how the issue led to excessive file handles being opened.
  2. **Impact**: The impact is resource exhaustion on the server side (STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES), which is a denial of service to the application, but this is:
     - Not exploitable by attackers
     - A result of legitimate application behavior 
     - Only affects the application itself (self-inflicted DoS)
     - Requires valid credentials and legitimate file access
  3. **Root cause**: The bug is in the comparison logic where `file->f_flags == cfile->f_flags` was too strict, not properly ignoring O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_TRUNC flags. The fix masks off these flags before comparison:
     ```c
     unsigned int oflags = file->f_flags & ~(O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_TRUNC);
     unsigned int cflags = cfile->f_flags & ~(O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_TRUNC);
     ```
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commit (#5) which fixed a UAF vulnerability with security implications, this commit only fixes incorrect handle reuse logic that causes performance issues.
  5. **No security boundary violation**: The issue doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security violation. It's purely a resource management inefficiency.
c538f400fae22 io_uring: consistently use rcu semantics with sqpoll thread
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is purely a code quality improvement that adds proper RCU annotations to satisfy the sparse static analyzer. The commit message explicitly states it's to "make sparse happy."
  2. **No functional changes**: The commit doesn't fix any actual security issue. It's adding type annotations (`__rcu`) and using proper RCU accessors (`rcu_assign_pointer`, `rcu_dereference_protected`) that were already semantically required but not formally declared.
  3. **The actual vulnerability was already fixed**: The referenced commit ac0b8b327a5677d already fixed the real use-after-free vulnerability. That commit properly added RCU protection and reference counting to prevent the security issue.
  4. **Code consistency improvement**: This commit is a follow-up cleanup that ensures consistent use of RCU primitives throughout the code. While it improves code correctness from a formal verification perspective, it doesn't address any exploitable security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", this follows the same pattern of code improvements and race condition prevention that don't rise to the level of CVE assignment.
  The changes are important for code maintainability and preventing future issues, but they don't fix an existing security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
cf625013d8741 block: don't use submit_bio_noacct_nocheck in blk_zone_wplug_bio_work
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a potential deadlock vulnerability:
  1. **Deadlock condition**: The commit message explicitly states "can cause deadlocks when freezing a queue with pending bio write plugs." This is a denial-of-service vulnerability.
  2. **Root cause**: The bug occurs because `submit_bio_noacct_nocheck()` was being called for BIOs that had already gone through freeze protection in the initial submit_bio path. When these BIOs are resubmitted from the zone write plug work, they attempt to acquire freeze protection again, which can deadlock if a queue freeze operation is in progress.
  3. **Security impact**: This deadlock can hang the system's I/O subsystem, causing a denial of service. The deadlock occurs between:
     - Queue freeze operation waiting for all queue usage references to be dropped
     - Zone write plug BIOs trying to re-acquire queue usage references through bio_queue_enter()
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits, "Similar Commit 2" and "Similar Commit 4" both received CVEs for deadlock issues in the zone write plugging code. This commit fixes a similar class of vulnerability in the same subsystem.
  5. **Fix validity**: The fix correctly bypasses the redundant freeze protection by calling `submit_bio()` or `blk_mq_submit_bio()` directly, which is appropriate since these BIOs have already acquired the necessary protections during their initial submission.
  The vulnerability allows local users to potentially trigger a system hang through specific I/O patterns on zoned block devices, making it a legitimate security issue warranting a CVE assignment.
ac0b8b327a567 io_uring: fix use-after-free of sq->thread in __io_uring_show_fdinfo()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Use-After-Free vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in `__io_uring_show_fdinfo()` where `sq->thread` (a task_struct pointer) can be freed while being used in `getrusage()`.
  2. **KASAN report with clear exploitation path**: The commit message includes a detailed KASAN report showing:
     - Read of freed memory at `getrusage+0x1109/0x1a60`
     - The memory was allocated by task 298 and freed by task 22 (RCU callback)
     - The freed object belongs to the `task_struct` cache
  3. **Race condition with security impact**: The vulnerability occurs due to a race condition where:
     - `__io_uring_show_fdinfo()` accesses `sq->thread` without proper reference counting
     - The thread can exit and the task_struct can be freed via RCU while fdinfo is reading it
     - This leads to accessing freed memory
  4. **Fix implements proper synchronization**: The fix adds:
     - RCU protection via `rcu_read_lock()`/`rcu_read_unlock()`
     - Proper reference counting with `get_task_struct()`/`put_task_struct()`
     - Use of `rcu_assign_pointer()` when setting the thread pointer
  5. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: This follows the pattern of the similar commits shown (CVE Status: YES), particularly:
     - Clear use-after-free vulnerability
     - KASAN detection with stack traces
     - Race condition in kernel code
     - Memory safety violation
  The vulnerability allows reading freed kernel memory which could potentially lead to information disclosure or system instability, warranting CVE assignment.
94209d27d1410 block: use q->elevator with ->elevator_lock held in elv_iosched_show()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The change addresses a minor code correctness issue where a locally cached elevator reference (`eq`) is used instead of directly accessing `q->elevator` while holding the lock. This is a code quality improvement, not a security fix.
  2. **No exploitable vulnerability**: The code already holds the `elevator_lock` mutex when accessing the elevator data. The issue is that it uses a stale local variable (`eq = q->elevator`) that was assigned before taking the lock, but since the lock is held during the actual access, there's no race condition that could lead to a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: Even if `q->elevator` changed between the initial assignment and taking the lock, the worst case would be reading from a potentially stale elevator pointer while displaying scheduler information - this is an informational display function (`elv_iosched_show()`) that doesn't perform any security-sensitive operations.
  4. **Context confirms non-security nature**: This appears to be part of a larger refactoring series for elevator/scheduler code improvements, not security fixes. The surrounding commits (like "move blk_mq_add_queue_tag_set() after blk_mq_map_swqueue()") are also code organization improvements.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This change is similar in nature to the provided examples of non-CVE commits that fix minor issues in the elevator subsystem without security implications.
  The commit simply ensures code correctness by using `q->elevator->type` directly while holding the lock, rather than using a potentially stale cached reference. This is a good programming practice but doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
7ed9138a72829 perf: Ensure bpf_perf_link path is properly serialized
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a serialization/locking fix that ensures proper mutex protection for the `bpf_perf_link_attach()` code path. The commit adds mutex locking (`ctx->mutex`) around `perf_event_set_bpf_prog()` calls to match the existing protection used in the `PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_BPF` ioctl path.
  2. **Security impact**: While this is a race condition fix, there's no clear security vulnerability being addressed:
     - The commit message only mentions that the path is "not serialized" - it doesn't mention any security implications
     - The code changes show it's adding proper locking to prevent concurrent access, but doesn't indicate any memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues
     - This appears to be a correctness/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability
  3. **Code changes analysis**: 
     - The fix creates a new `__perf_event_set_bpf_prog()` function (the original logic)
     - Wraps it with `perf_event_set_bpf_prog()` that adds mutex protection via `perf_event_ctx_lock()`/`perf_event_ctx_unlock()`
     - The ioctl path is updated to call the internal `__perf_event_set_bpf_prog()` since it already has mutex protection
     - This is a standard locking pattern to ensure serialization
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the reference commits:
     - Commits marked "CVE Status: YES" dealt with NULL pointer dereferences and invalid memory access that could lead to crashes
     - This commit is more similar to the "CVE Status: NO" commits that involved API improvements, documentation, or non-security bug fixes
  The lack of any mention of security implications, crash potential, or exploitability in the commit message, combined with the nature of the fix being a missing lock rather than a memory safety issue, indicates this is a reliability/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability fix.
fde04c7e2775f io_uring: fix spurious drain flushing
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug in io_uring's drain request handling that could cause requests to be executed out of order, but it does not address a security vulnerability.
  The issue is that `io_queue_deferred()` could incorrectly process non-drain requests before drain requests, violating the ordering guarantee that drain requests provide (they should wait for all previous inflight I/O to complete). The fix ensures proper ordering by:
  1. Tracking whether any drain request has been seen in the defer list
  2. Checking sequence numbers for the first request or when a drain has been seen
  3. Preventing premature execution of non-drain requests
  While this is a correctness issue that could affect application behavior relying on drain semantics, it does not create exploitable security conditions like:
  - Memory corruption/use-after-free
  - Privilege escalation  
  - Information disclosure
  - Denial of service beyond normal API misuse
  The commit message explicitly describes this as fixing "spurious drain flushing" - a functional ordering bug rather than a security vulnerability. Similar to the reference commits shown which also fix io_uring functional issues without CVE assignments.
47a827cd7929d nvmet-fcloop: access fcpreq only when holding reqlock
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a race condition in the nvmet-fcloop driver where `fcpreq` could be accessed without holding the `reqlock`, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference or use-after-free. However, this does not warrant a CVE because:
  1. **Test/Debug Driver Only**: The fcloop driver is explicitly a "NVMe over Fabrics FC Transport Loopback Test driver" as stated in the Kconfig. It's not used in production systems but solely for testing NVMe-FC transport interfaces.
  2. **No Production Impact**: Since this is a test driver that creates loopback connections for testing purposes, it has no impact on production systems or real security boundaries.
  3. **Limited Attack Surface**: The race condition only affects test scenarios and cannot be exploited in a production environment since the driver itself is not meant for production use.
  The code changes show the fix moves the `fcpreq` pointer access inside the lock-protected critical section and properly handles the abort case to prevent the race condition. While this is a valid bug fix that improves test reliability, it does not represent a security vulnerability in production code.
41d69d4d78d8b btrfs: exit after state split error at set_extent_bit()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a use-after-free vulnerability, the security impact is extremely limited because:
  1. **Requires exotic configuration**: The vulnerability only manifests when `CONFIG_BUG` is disabled, which is an uncommon kernel configuration that most production systems don't use.
  2. **Not remotely exploitable**: This is an internal error handling path in the btrfs filesystem code that would require local access and specific filesystem operations to trigger.
  3. **Error path only**: The vulnerability only occurs in an error handling path when `split_state()` fails, which itself is an exceptional condition.
  4. **Limited attack surface**: An attacker would need to:
     - Have local access to the system
     - Be able to perform filesystem operations
     - Somehow trigger the specific error condition in `split_state()`
     - Have a kernel compiled without `CONFIG_BUG`
  The fix is a defensive programming improvement that prevents a theoretical use-after-free in an extremely rare configuration and error scenario, rather than addressing a practical security vulnerability that could be exploited in real-world systems.
62a2175ddf7e7 gfs2: pass through holder from the VFS for freeze/thaw
- [sasha] Based on the code changes provided in the commit, let me analyze what this commit does:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it makes a functional improvement to the GFS2 filesystem's freeze/thaw implementation by:
  1. **Adding the `enum freeze_holder who` parameter** to `gfs2_do_thaw()`, `gfs2_freeze_super()`, and `gfs2_thaw_super()` functions to pass through the freeze holder type from the VFS layer.
  2. **Propagating the holder type** instead of hard-coding `FREEZE_HOLDER_USERSPACE` in all freeze/thaw operations. This allows the kernel to properly distinguish between userspace-initiated freezes (via ioctl) and kernel-initiated freezes (during suspend/hibernate).
  3. The changes are purely about **API consistency and correctness** - ensuring that the freeze holder type is preserved throughout the call chain rather than being hard-coded.
  The commit message explicitly states this is to handle cases where "the holder isn't userspace but the kernel, e.g., during systemd suspend/hibernate." This is a functional fix to ensure proper behavior during system suspend/resume operations, not a security fix.
  There are no security implications such as:
  - No privilege escalation fixes
  - No access control changes  
  - No memory corruption fixes
  - No race condition fixes
  - No input validation improvements
  - No buffer overflow fixes
  This is a straightforward API improvement to properly handle different freeze contexts, which is important for correctness but not security-critical.
5e85262e542d6 btrfs: fix fsync of files with no hard links not persisting deletion
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: This bug does not cross any security boundaries or privilege levels. The issue only affects files that a user has already opened and can fsync - there's no unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  2. **Expected Filesystem Behavior**: The bug causes incorrect filesystem behavior (file persisting after deletion when it has 0 hard links), but this is a data consistency issue rather than a security vulnerability. The commit message explicitly states this is about matching the behavior of other filesystems like ext4, xfs, and f2fs.
  3. **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: The bug doesn't expose sensitive data, allow unauthorized modifications, or bypass access controls. It simply causes a file with 0 hard links to incorrectly persist after fsync and log replay.
  4. **Limited Impact**: The issue only occurs in a very specific scenario:
     - A process must have an open file descriptor
     - The file's last hard link must be removed while the fd is open
     - The process must fsync the file through the fd
     - A power failure/crash must occur
     - Only then does the file incorrectly persist after log replay
  5. **Data Consistency, Not Security**: This is fundamentally a filesystem consistency bug where the log replay doesn't properly handle orphaned inodes. While incorrect, it doesn't create security risks.
  The code changes show:
  - Adding a check for `inode->vfs_inode.i_nlink == 0` and committing the delayed inode to ensure the deletion is properly logged
  - Removing the skip condition for inodes with 0 hard links in `btrfs_log_inode_parent()`
  These changes ensure proper deletion semantics but don't address any security vulnerability.
1363c134ade81 fs/filesystems: Fix potential unsigned integer underflow in fs_name()
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Limited Attack Surface**: The bug only affects the `sysfs()` system call which is:
     - Disabled by default (`CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL` defaults to 'n')
     - Obsolete and not supported in modern libc
     - Rarely enabled in production systems
  2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The unsigned integer underflow causes:
     - Incorrect iteration through the filesystem list
     - Potential to return wrong filesystem name or -EINVAL
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure of sensitive data
  3. **Low Impact**: Even if triggered:
     - The function still checks bounds properly (it won't access invalid memory)
     - Worst case is returning the wrong filesystem name or error
     - The read lock prevents concurrent modification issues
  4. **Difficult to Exploit**: Exploitation would require:
     - System with CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL enabled (rare)
     - Calling deprecated sysfs() syscall with option 2 and index 0
     - Even then, impact is minimal
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Unlike the CVE-assigned examples which fixed:
     - Integer overflows leading to memory corruption (Similar Commits 1 & 2)
     - Out-of-bounds array access (Similar Commit 3)
     
     This commit only fixes a logic bug with minimal security impact.
  The fix is correct and improves code quality by preventing the underflow, but the security implications are negligible compared to typical CVE-worthy vulnerabilities.
3bf179e36da91 btrfs: exit after state insertion failure at btrfs_convert_extent_bit()
- [sasha] **Analysis Complete**
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  While this commit does fix a potential invalid memory access issue, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **Extremely unlikely scenario**: The vulnerability only manifests when CONFIG_BUG is disabled, which is explicitly described as "an uncommon and exotic scenario" in the commit message. CONFIG_BUG is enabled by default in virtually all production kernels.
  2. **Defense in depth fix**: This is a defensive programming improvement rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability. The primary protection (BUG()) already exists and works in normal configurations.
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: Even if the error pointer dereference occurred, it would likely just cause a kernel crash (DoS) in an already-panicking system. The system is already in a critical error state when extent_io_tree_panic() is called.
  4. **Similar to error handling improvements**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commits that simply improve error handling without fixing actual security vulnerabilities (like Similar Commit 3) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", while those fixing actual security issues like BUG_ON conditions that could be triggered (Similar Commits 1, 2, 4, 5) were marked as "CVE Status: YES".
  This commit is more akin to code hardening and defensive programming rather than fixing an actual security vulnerability that could be exploited in real-world scenarios.
