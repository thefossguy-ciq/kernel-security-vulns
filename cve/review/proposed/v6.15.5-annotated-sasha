66abb996999de drm/amd/display: Fix AMDGPU_MAX_BL_LEVEL value
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me summarize my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a functional bug in brightness scaling calculations, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when custom brightness curves are enabled, the scaling functions use `AMDGPU_MAX_BL_LEVEL` (0xFF) instead of `MAX_BACKLIGHT_LEVEL` (0xFFFF), causing incorrect brightness calculations.
  2. **Impact is Limited to Display Brightness**: The bug only affects how brightness values are scaled when custom brightness curves are used. From the code:
     - `scale_input_to_fw()` incorrectly scales user input to firmware values using 0xFF instead of 0xFFFF
     - `scale_fw_to_input()` incorrectly scales firmware values back to user values
     - This results in incorrect brightness levels being set, but no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues
  3. **No Attack Vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this bug to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or breach confidentiality. It's purely a display brightness calculation error.
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: All the similar commits provided (which were marked as "CVE Status: NO") also deal with brightness/backlight handling issues, and none were assigned CVEs because they're functional bugs, not security vulnerabilities.
  The fix simply replaces `AMDGPU_MAX_BL_LEVEL` (0xFF) with `MAX_BACKLIGHT_LEVEL` (0xFFFF) to match the expanded brightness range that was introduced in commit 16dc8bc27c2a.
16dc8bc27c2aa drm/amd/display: Export full brightness range to userspace
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  The commit changes how the AMD display driver exports brightness range to userspace, expanding it from 0-0xFF (8-bit) to the full PWM range of 0-0xFFFF (16-bit). This is a feature enhancement, not a security fix.
  Key observations:
  1. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit adds functionality to expose finer brightness control granularity to userspace. It doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security issues.
  2. **No dangerous code patterns**: While the commit introduces division operations (e.g., `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL(..., max - min)`), there's no evidence of division-by-zero vulnerabilities because:
     - The `get_brightness_range()` function sets min and max by multiplying firmware values by constants (0x101 or 1000)
     - The scaling only occurs when `get_brightness_range()` returns true (non-zero)
     - Even if min == max theoretically, this would be a functionality bug, not a security vulnerability
  3. **Safe integer handling**: The code uses 64-bit arithmetic (`u64`) to prevent overflow in calculations before division, showing proper care in handling large values.
  4. **Userspace API change only**: The change only affects how brightness values are presented to userspace through the backlight subsystem. It doesn't introduce any kernel memory safety issues or privilege boundary violations.
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: All the similar commits provided (changing brightness defaults, adding quirks, restoring brightness after reset) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", confirming that backlight/brightness changes are generally not security-relevant.
  This is a quality-of-life improvement for users who want finer control over display brightness, not a security fix.
03b979e1025fb drm/amd/display: Optimize custom brightness curve
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code changes and the surrounding context, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Performance optimization only**: The commit is purely a performance optimization for the brightness curve calculation. It doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The code changes only affect how quickly the brightness level is calculated when dragging a brightness slider. There's no privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant behavior being fixed.
  3. **Existing bounds checking remains**: While the new code does access `caps->luminance_data[caps->data_points/2]` without explicit bounds checking at that point, there are two important factors:
     - The code checks `if (!caps->data_points) return;` before the optimization, ensuring data_points is non-zero
     - The loop condition `while (i < caps->data_points)` ensures array bounds are respected
     - The `data_points/2` calculation with integer division will always produce a valid index when data_points > 0
  4. **No exploitable condition fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is to improve UI responsiveness when "dragging a power slider" - it's addressing a performance issue, not a security issue.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference, they all deal with brightness/backlight adjustments and UI improvements, and none were assigned CVEs. This commit follows the same pattern.
  The change is a legitimate optimization that improves user experience by starting the search from the midpoint of the brightness curve data rather than always starting from the beginning, which can be slow when there are many data points.
ffcaed1d7ecef drm/amd/display: Only read ACPI backlight caps once
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a functional bug related to incorrect backlight brightness values being used during device registration. The issue is that backlight caps are read twice - once in `amdgpu_dm_update_backlight_caps()` and potentially modified by `update_connector_ext_caps()`, then read again in `amdgpu_dm_register_backlight_device()`.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The worst case scenario is that incorrect backlight brightness values are used, which could result in:
     - Display being too bright or too dim
     - Incorrect initial brightness settings
     - User experience issues with backlight control
  3. **No security implications**: Looking at the code changes:
     - No memory corruption issues
     - No privilege escalation possibilities  
     - No access control bypasses
     - No information disclosure
     - No potential for system compromise
     - The values being used incorrectly are just brightness levels (min/max/ac_level/dc_level)
  4. **Code changes**: The fix simply reuses already cached backlight caps (`caps = &dm->backlight_caps[aconnector->bl_idx]`) instead of calling `amdgpu_acpi_get_backlight_caps()` again, which prevents using stale/unmodified values.
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: All the similar commits provided (commits 1-5) also deal with backlight functionality and none were assigned CVEs. They handle:
     - Validation of backlight values
     - Locking during backlight updates
     - Restoring backlight after GPU reset
     - Supporting minimum backlight quirks
     - Allowing lower backlight values
  This is a quality/correctness fix for display backlight handling, not a security vulnerability fix.
8b5f3a229a70d drm/amd/display: Fix default DC and AC levels
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit fixes a calculation error where AC/DC brightness levels from ACPI (which are percentages 0-100) were being used directly instead of being scaled to the actual brightness range supported by the display.
  2. **Security impact**: This is a functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability. The issue only affects:
     - Initial brightness level when booting on AC vs DC power
     - User experience (incorrect default brightness)
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access
  3. **Code changes**: The fix simply adds proper scaling:
     - Before: `props.brightness = caps.ac_level;` (treating percentage as absolute value)
     - After: `props.brightness = (max - min) * DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(caps.ac_level, 100);` (converting percentage to actual range)
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: This matches the pattern of the similar commits shown (brightness level adjustments, backlight caps validation) which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO" as they deal with display functionality rather than security issues.
  The commit is a straightforward bug fix for incorrect brightness level calculations with no security implications.
4b61b8a390511 drm/amd/display: Add debugging message for brightness caps
- [sasha] Based on the commit analysis, I can now provide my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit adds a debugging message (`drm_dbg`) to display brightness caps values. It does not fix any security vulnerability.
  2. **Code Changes Analysis**:
     - Adds local variables `int min, max`
     - Adds a call to `get_brightness_range()` in the existing condition check
     - Sets `props.max_brightness = max - min` (which appears to be a bug fix/improvement)
     - Adds a debug print statement showing brightness caps values
  3. **No Security Impact**: 
     - The changes are primarily for debugging/diagnostics purposes
     - The setting of `props.max_brightness` appears to be fixing incorrect brightness range handling, but this is a functional fix rather than a security fix
     - No memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security-relevant patterns are being addressed
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) also deal with brightness/backlight functionality improvements and none were assigned CVEs. They address functional issues like flickering, validation of caps values, and DSC configuration - all non-security related improvements.
  The commit is essentially adding diagnostic logging and fixing a minor functional issue with brightness range calculation, neither of which constitute security vulnerabilities requiring CVE assignment.
265d6aba165c5 riscv: uaccess: Only restore the CSR_STATUS SUM bit
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's the security assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit is a correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **The issue is about preserving correct state during task switches**: The original implementation (commit 788aa64c01f1) saved the entire CSR_STATUS register value during context switches to preserve the SR_SUM bit (Supervisor User Memory access bit).
  2. **The bug is using `csrs` (CSR Set) instead of properly masking**: The `csrs` instruction performs an OR operation, meaning it sets bits but never clears them. When restoring the saved status, if the saved value had other bits set (like interrupt enable bits, floating point status, etc.), those would also be OR'd into the current CSR_STATUS.
  3. **This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability**:
     - The code is only restoring state that was previously saved from the same privilege level (supervisor mode)
     - There's no privilege escalation - the bits being potentially set incorrectly are supervisor-mode bits being restored in supervisor mode
     - The main concern is that unintended bits might remain set after a context switch, which could cause functional issues but not security vulnerabilities
  4. **The fix properly masks to only restore the SR_SUM bit**: The new code uses `and s0, s0, s1` to mask out everything except the SR_SUM bit before using `csrs`, ensuring only that specific bit is modified.
  5. **Similar commits in the reference set marked as "NO CVE"**: The reference commits show similar patterns of fixing CSR handling, register naming, and state preservation issues - none of which were assigned CVEs because they're correctness fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit prevents potential functional issues from incorrect state restoration but doesn't fix an exploitable security vulnerability.
6f11adcc6f36f io_uring: gate REQ_F_ISREG on !S_ANON_INODE as well
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional regression, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that after commit cfd86ef7e8e7 added S_IFREG to anonymous inodes, io_uring incorrectly started treating reads from anonymous inodes (eventfd, timerfd, etc.) as regular file operations. This caused io_uring to wait for more data instead of returning immediately available data, breaking applications that expect non-blocking behavior.
  The code change adds a check for `!(inode->i_flags & S_ANON_INODE)` to prevent setting `REQ_F_ISREG` for anonymous inodes. While this breaks application functionality and could cause hangs, it doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities like:
  - Memory corruption
  - Privilege escalation
  - Information disclosure
  - Access control bypass
  This is a compatibility issue that affects application behavior but has no security implications, similar to the other "NO CVE" examples that fixed functional issues without security impact.
178b8ff66ff82 io_uring/kbuf: flag partial buffer mappings
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a data integrity bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue causes "gaps in the received/read data" - essentially a functional bug where data might be missing or incomplete during network I/O operations.
  2. **No privilege escalation or access control bypass**: The code changes show this is about preventing retry operations when partial buffer mapping occurs during io_uring bundle operations. There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption that could be exploited
     - Privilege escalation possibilities
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure of sensitive data
  3. **Impact is limited to correctness**: The bug affects data correctness in network receive operations when using io_uring's bundle feature with non-incremental ring buffers. Line 840 shows the key check: `if (!sr->retry_flags && kmsg->msg.msg_inq > 1 && this_ret > 0 &&` - this determines whether to retry receiving more data. Without the partial_map flag, retries could happen inappropriately, causing gaps in received data.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, particularly commits 1-3 which were marked as "CVE Status: NO", they also dealt with buffer management and data handling issues in io_uring without security implications.
  5. **Fixes a functional regression**: This fixes commit 26ec15e4b0c1 which tried to optimize buffer handling but introduced a case where data gaps could occur - this is a functional regression, not a security issue.
  The commit is important for correctness and stability (hence the Cc to stable), but does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it doesn't represent a security vulnerability.
7f8073cfb04a9 s390/ptrace: Fix pointer dereferencing in regs_get_kernel_stack_nth()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and understanding of the kernel code:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: While the bug does return kernel stack addresses instead of the values at those addresses, this is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The commit d93a855c31b7 that introduced the bug was trying to fix KASAN false positives, and accidentally dropped the pointer dereference.
  2. **No privilege escalation or unauthorized access**: The bug affects `regs_get_kernel_stack_nth()` which is used by ftrace to read function arguments from the kernel stack. Access to ftrace requires root privileges or CAP_PERFMON capability. There is no path for unprivileged users to exploit this.
  3. **Limited impact**: The function already performs bounds checking (`regs_within_kernel_stack()`) to ensure the address is valid before accessing it. The bug simply returns the wrong data (address instead of value), which breaks functionality but doesn't create new attack vectors.
  4. **Debugging/tracing infrastructure**: This is part of the kernel's debugging and tracing infrastructure, which by design requires elevated privileges and can already access sensitive kernel information when used properly.
  5. **Compare to similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar commits 1 & 2 (ftrace null pointer dereference) were assigned CVEs because they cause kernel crashes
     - Similar commit 5 (mm: prevent dereferencing NULL ptr) was assigned a CVE because it prevents a NULL pointer dereference that could crash the kernel
     - This commit just fixes incorrect data being returned, not a crash or security boundary violation
  The commit is a simple bug fix that restores the correct behavior of returning the value at an address rather than the address itself. It does not introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities.
d1e420772cd1e x86/pkeys: Simplify PKRU update in signal frame
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my CVE assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of Change**: This is a code simplification/refactoring commit that eliminates an unnecessary dependency on XGETBV1 instruction. The commit message explicitly states "No functional changes" in its intent.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It simply refactors existing code to use an already established helper function (`set_xfeature_in_sigframe()`) instead of manually calculating the xstate_bv value using `xfeatures_in_use()`.
  3. **Previous Fix Already Addressed the Issue**: The actual security-relevant fix was already implemented in commit ae6012d72fa6 ("x86/pkeys: Ensure updated PKRU value is XRSTOR'd"), which fixed a real functional issue where PKRU values were not being properly restored from signal frames on AMD processors.
  4. **Code Changes Analysis**: 
     - The old code: `xstate_bv = (mask & xfeatures_in_use()) | XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU;`
     - The new code: Uses `set_xfeature_in_sigframe(buf, XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU)` which internally does the same thing
     - Both approaches achieve the same result of setting the PKRU bit in the xfeatures field
  5. **No Impact on Security**: This refactoring does not introduce or fix any security issues. It's purely a code quality improvement that removes an unnecessary call to XGETBV1 (via `xfeatures_in_use()`) and reuses existing functionality.
  The commit is a cleanup/optimization that follows a previous security fix, but itself has no security implications.
64e54461ab6e8 x86/fpu: Refactor xfeature bitmask update code for sigframe XSAVE
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a pure code refactoring that does not fix any security vulnerability. The changes extract existing code that updates xfeature bitmasks in signal frames into a new helper function `set_xfeature_in_sigframe()`. The functionality remains identical - it performs the same read-modify-write operation on the xfeatures field, just in a more reusable way. The commit message explicitly states this is for "reuse in similar cases" and to "ensure a consistent approach across similar usages." There is no security impact or bug fix involved, making this unsuitable for CVE assignment.
20c96ed278e36 rust: devres: do not dereference to the internal Revocable
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It fixes a design flaw in the API that could lead to incorrect usage but does not constitute a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **API Design Issue, Not Security Vulnerability**: The fix removes the `Deref` implementation that allowed direct access to the internal `Revocable` object. The concern was that users could call methods like `revoke()` or `revoke_nosync()` directly on the internal `Revocable`, bypassing the synchronization logic in `Devres::drop()`.
  2. **No Memory Safety Violation**: The code changes show that even with the flawed API, there's no memory corruption, use-after-free, or other memory safety issues. The `Revocable` type itself is designed to be safe even when `revoke()` is called multiple times.
  3. **Synchronization Concern**: The commit message states "we have to guarantee that the internal Revocable has been fully revoked before the device is fully unbound." This is about maintaining API invariants and proper synchronization, not about preventing security exploits.
  4. **Safe Rust Abstractions**: The entire implementation uses safe Rust abstractions with proper lifetime management. The fix is about preventing logical errors in resource management timing, not preventing security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: There's no indication that the original design could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impacts.
  The fix improves the API design by preventing misuse and ensuring proper synchronization between device unbinding and resource revocation, but this is a correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
f744201c6159f rust: devres: fix race in Devres::drop()
- [sasha] Based on my comprehensive analysis of this commit and the surrounding context, here is my determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Clear Security Vulnerability**: This fixes a race condition that leads to a **use-after-free vulnerability** in kernel space. The commit message explicitly states "this can potentially lead to user-after-free bugs" (note: likely meant "use-after-free").
  2. **Memory Safety Violation**: The vulnerability violates memory safety guarantees by allowing access to freed memory. The race condition can result in the device resource destructor running after the device has been fully unbound, creating a window where freed memory could be accessed or reallocated.
  3. **Kernel Space Impact**: This vulnerability exists in kernel code, where exploitation could lead to:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Kernel memory corruption
     - System instability or crashes
     - Potential for arbitrary code execution
  4. **Similar to CVE-Assigned Patterns**: The vulnerability pattern matches several of the similar commits that received CVEs:
     - Like the drm/virtio commit (CVE assigned): Race between handle creation and closing
     - Like the drm/amd/display commits (CVE assigned): Race between concurrent operations leading to use-after-free
     - Like the media/streamzap commit (CVE assigned): Race between device disconnection and callback execution
  5. **Exploitable Race Condition**: The commit shows a detailed race scenario where CPU0 and CPU1 can race, potentially allowing an attacker with the ability to trigger device binding/unbinding to exploit this vulnerability.
  6. **Fix Complexity**: The fix required implementing a complex synchronization protocol using completion primitives, indicating this was a non-trivial security issue that required careful design to resolve properly.
  The vulnerability represents a serious memory safety issue in the Rust kernel abstractions that could be exploited by an attacker with appropriate device access to potentially gain elevated privileges or cause system instability.
4b76fafb20dd4 rust: revocable: indicate whether `data` has been revoked already
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security fix**: This commit is a functional enhancement that adds a return value to the `revoke()` and `revoke_nosync()` methods to indicate whether the revocation was already done. This is an API improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Purpose is synchronization logic**: The commit message clearly states this is "required by Devres in order to synchronize the completion of the revoke process." It's enabling proper synchronization in the devres subsystem, not fixing an existing security vulnerability.
  3. **No vulnerability being fixed**: The code changes show:
     - The methods now return a boolean indicating if revocation happened
     - The internal logic uses `swap()` which already returned this value
     - No security-critical bugs like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or access control issues are being addressed
  4. **Related commits context**: Looking at the related devres commits (f744201c6159), while they do fix race conditions, this specific commit is just providing the API capability that those fixes need. The actual race condition fix is in the devres code, not in this revocable code change.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the other Rust infrastructure commits shown as examples (like the lockdep commit 966944f3711) which were marked as NO CVE - they're improving the Rust kernel infrastructure but not fixing security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a prerequisite for fixing race conditions in devres, but by itself, it's just an API enhancement that returns additional information about the operation's success.
1b56e765bf899 rust: completion: implement initial abstraction
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **New feature, not a security fix**: The commit implements an initial Rust abstraction for the kernel's completion synchronization primitive. It's adding new functionality rather than fixing an existing security vulnerability.
  2. **Safe wrapper around existing C API**: The code creates a safe Rust wrapper around the existing C `completion` API (`init_completion`, `complete_all`, `wait_for_completion`). It doesn't modify the underlying C implementation or fix any bugs in it.
  3. **No security vulnerability mentioned**: The commit message makes no mention of fixing security issues, vulnerabilities, or any safety problems. It explicitly states it's implementing an "initial abstraction" for subsequent features.
  4. **Proper safety annotations**: The Rust code includes appropriate `Send` and `Sync` implementations with safety comments explaining why they're correct. The unsafe blocks are minimal and well-justified (only for FFI calls to the C API).
  5. **No sensitive component changes**: While synchronization primitives can be security-sensitive, this commit doesn't change any existing behavior - it just provides a Rust interface to existing, well-tested C functionality.
  The commit follows the pattern of other Rust abstractions in the kernel that provide safe wrappers around C APIs without fixing underlying security issues. Similar commits in the reference set (like "rust: alloc: add `Vec` to prelude" and "rust: don't select CONSTRUCTORS") were marked as NOT requiring CVEs.
d358a51444c88 drm/amd/display: Get LTTPR IEEE OUI/Device ID From Closest LTTPR To Host
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this change. The key change is in how the driver calculates the DPCD address offset to read the IEEE OUI and Device ID from the closest LTTPR (Link Training Tunable PHY Repeater) to the host.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is fixing incorrect behavior in reading LTTPR IEEE OUI/Device ID fields, but this is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. The previous code was reading from a fixed location (DP_LTTPR_IEEE_OUI) rather than calculating the correct offset based on LTTPR count.
  2. **No memory safety issues**: The offset calculation uses `dp_get_closest_lttpr_offset()` which returns `DP_REPEATER_CONFIGURATION_AND_STATUS_SIZE * (lttpr_count - 1)`. The `lttpr_count` is validated through `dp_parse_lttpr_repeater_count()` which only returns values 0-8, preventing any integer overflow or out-of-bounds access.
  3. **No privilege escalation or access control bypass**: The change only affects which DPCD register offset is read to get device identification information. This doesn't grant any additional privileges or bypass any security mechanisms.
  4. **No information disclosure**: The code is reading device identification fields that are meant to be read. It's not exposing any sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: The commit is similar in nature to the first two example commits which were marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both of those also dealt with LTTPR-related functionality improvements without security implications.
  The commit is a functional fix to ensure the driver reads the IEEE OUI and Device ID from the correct LTTPR in a cascaded setup, which is necessary for applying device-specific workarounds. This is a display driver functionality improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
8989cb919b27c drm/amd/display: Add early 8b/10b channel equalization test pattern sequence
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I need to determine if this introduces a security vulnerability.
  **Analysis of the commit:**
  1. **What the commit does:**
     - Adds support for an early 8b/10b channel equalization test pattern sequence for some LTTPR + old dongle combinations
     - Introduces a new function `dp_get_closest_lttpr_offset()` that calculates an offset based on `lttpr_count`
     - Uses this offset to write to DPCD addresses
  2. **Key security concern:**
     The function `dp_get_closest_lttpr_offset()` performs the calculation:
     ```c
     return DP_REPEATER_CONFIGURATION_AND_STATUS_SIZE * (lttpr_count - 1);
     ```
     
     This function has **no bounds checking** on `lttpr_count`. If `lttpr_count` is 0, this would result in:
     - `(0 - 1)` which wraps around to 0xFFFFFFFF in unsigned arithmetic
     - Multiplying by `DP_REPEATER_CONFIGURATION_AND_STATUS_SIZE` (0x50) would result in a very large offset
     - This offset is then used in: `DP_TRAINING_PATTERN_SET_PHY_REPEATER1 + closest_lttpr_address_offset`
  3. **Examining the call path:**
     In `set_link_settings_and_perform_early_tps2_retimer_pre_lt_sequence()`:
     - `lttpr_count` is passed directly without validation
     - The function calls `dp_get_closest_lttpr_offset(lttpr_count)` 
     - Uses the result for DPCD write operations
  4. **Source of `lttpr_count`:**
     - Comes from `dp_parse_lttpr_repeater_count()` which can return 0 for invalid values
     - In `dp_perform_8b_10b_link_training()`, `repeater_cnt` is obtained but not validated before being passed
  5. **Potential impact:**
     - Integer underflow leading to out-of-bounds memory access
     - Could potentially write to unintended DPCD addresses
     - This is a **memory safety issue** that could lead to unpredictable behavior
  6. **Comparison with similar commits:**
     - Similar Commit 4 and 5 (CVE Status: YES) fixed bounds checking issues in `aux_rd_interval` array access
     - Those commits added explicit bounds checks like `repeater_cnt > 0 && repeater_cnt < MAX_REPEATER_CNT`
     - This new commit introduces a similar pattern but WITHOUT the necessary bounds checking
  **Conclusion:**
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  The commit introduces an integer underflow vulnerability in `dp_get_closest_lttpr_offset()` when `lttpr_count` is 0. This results in a calculation of `(0 - 1) * 0x50` which causes an extremely large offset value due to unsigned integer wraparound. This offset is then used for DPCD write operations, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access. The lack of input validation before the subtraction operation creates a security vulnerability similar to the bounds checking issues fixed in previous CVE-assigned commits.
c50784e99f0e7 sched_ext: Make scx_group_set_weight() always update tg->scx.weight
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a consistency/correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The change ensures that `tg->scx_weight` is always updated when `scx_group_set_weight()` is called, regardless of whether `scx_cgroup_enabled` is true or the cgroup_set_weight operation exists.
  2. **Issue being fixed**: The problem was that when `scx_cgroup` was not enabled, the function would not update `tg->scx_weight`. This could lead to `ops.cgroup_init()` being called with a stale weight value later, but this is a functional correctness issue, not a security issue.
  3. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The stale weight value would only affect scheduling weight calculations
     - It doesn't involve memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypass
     - The worst case is incorrect scheduling weights being used, which affects performance/fairness but not security
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 3 (CVE: YES) fixed a race condition that could cause null pointer dereference
     - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) fixed a fault/crash in reweight_entity
     - This commit doesn't fix any crash, memory corruption, or exploitable condition
  5. **Code change**: The fix simply moves the `tg->scx_weight = weight;` assignment outside the conditional block to ensure it's always executed. This is a straightforward logic fix without security implications.
  The commit fixes a functional bug where scheduling weights could become inconsistent, but there's no security vulnerability being addressed here.
55e52d055393f arm64: dts: qcom: x1e78100-t14s: fix missing HID supplies
- [sasha] Now I have enough information to make an informed decision about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is a device tree configuration fix that adds missing power supply definitions for HID (Human Interface Device) devices on the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6.
  The changes:
  1. Add definitions for VCC3B regulator (vreg_misc_3p3) that powers HID devices
  2. Add vdd-supply and vddl-supply properties to touchpad, keyboard, and touchscreen device nodes
  3. The warning messages shown ("supply vdd not found, using dummy regulator") indicate the kernel was gracefully handling the missing supplies by using dummy regulators
  This is a hardware description/configuration issue, not a security vulnerability. The kernel's regulator framework already safely handles missing supplies by providing dummy regulators as a fallback. The fix improves proper hardware control and eliminates warning messages, but does not address any security-relevant behavior like:
  - Memory corruption
  - Privilege escalation  
  - Information disclosure
  - Access control bypass
  - Race conditions
  Similar commits in the history (266cb58f08f3, 4afd99042571, etc.) that fix missing power supplies have not been assigned CVEs, which is consistent with this being a non-security fix.
40f970ba7a4ab drm/amdgpu/mes: add missing locking in helper functions
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code context, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Missing synchronization, not a vulnerability fix**: The commit adds missing locking to helper functions to ensure exclusive access to MES (Micro Engine Scheduler) resources. While this is a correctness issue that could lead to race conditions, the commit is adding preventive locking rather than fixing an exploitable security vulnerability.
  2. **Pattern consistency**: Looking at the code changes, the commit is adding the same locking pattern (amdgpu_mes_lock/unlock) that already exists in other MES functions like `amdgpu_mes_map_legacy_queue()` and `amdgpu_mes_unmap_legacy_queue()`. This suggests it's fixing an oversight where these helper functions were missing the standard locking protection.
  3. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit message simply states "add missing locking in helper functions" without mentioning any security implications, crashes, or exploitable conditions. It appears to be a proactive fix for potential race conditions.
  4. **Helper function nature**: The affected functions (`amdgpu_mes_rreg`, `amdgpu_mes_wreg`, `amdgpu_mes_reg_wait`, etc.) are register read/write helper functions that communicate with hardware through the MES interface. While concurrent access could cause incorrect behavior, there's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security-critical impacts.
  5. **Previous attempt context**: The git history shows a previous attempt to add MES locking (commit 3612702852ac) that was reverted because it caused issues with sleeping in atomic context. This new commit appears to be a more targeted approach to add locking only where safe and necessary.
  While race conditions can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities, this appears to be a routine synchronization fix for driver correctness rather than addressing an exploitable security issue.
bc8169003b41e crypto: powerpc/poly1305 - add depends on BROKEN for now
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is marking the PowerPC Poly1305 implementation as BROKEN to prevent its use. The code has a functional issue where it uses VSX (Vector Scalar Extensions) instructions with `preempt_disable()` in contexts where it might be called from softirq (like network packet processing in WireGuard).
  2. **Safety mechanism, not vulnerability**: The issue is that the code uses:
     - `preempt_disable()` + `enable_kernel_vsx()` in `vsx_begin()`
     - This is not safe in softirq context where preemption is already disabled
     - This could lead to kernel warnings or potential system instability, but not a security vulnerability
  3. **Preventive measure**: The commit adds `depends on BROKEN` to prevent users from enabling this optimization until it's properly fixed to handle softirq contexts correctly.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they all deal with:
     - Module loading failures
     - Build warnings
     - Functional correctness issues
     - Configuration fixes
     None of these were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No security impact described**: The commit message only mentions that the code is "not safe to call in softirq context" without describing any security implications like privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service beyond normal kernel instability.
  This is a quality/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
5ce920e6a8db4 arm64: dts: qcom: x1-crd: Fix vreg_l2j_1p2 voltage
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a voltage configuration fix for a power regulator (vreg_l2j_1p2) that supplies various PHYs (USB, PCIe, and DisplayPort PHYs). The change increases the voltage from 1200000 uV (1.2V) to 1256000 uV (1.256V) to match the ACPI DSDT table specification.
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Configuration correction**: This is fixing an incorrect voltage specification to match the proper hardware requirements
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: Voltage regulators for PHYs don't involve any security-sensitive operations like access control, authentication, or data protection
  3. **Hardware specification alignment**: The commit is simply aligning the device tree with the ACPI DSDT table for consistency
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (fixing PHY supply configurations), none of which were assigned CVEs
  The components affected (USB PHYs, PCIe PHYs, DisplayPort PHYs) use this regulator for their power supply. An incorrect voltage could potentially cause hardware malfunction or instability, but this doesn't constitute a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
673fa129e558c arm64: dts: qcom: x1e78100-t14s: mark l12b and l15b always-on
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit adds `regulator-always-on` properties to two voltage regulators (l12b and l15b) in the device tree for a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 laptop. This is a preventive configuration change to ensure these regulators remain powered on at all times.
  Key reasons why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Not a vulnerability fix**: The commit is marking regulators as always-on to prevent potential system instability or hardware issues if they were to be disabled. This is a preventive measure, not fixing an exploitable security flaw.
  2. **Hardware configuration change**: This is a device tree change that configures hardware behavior. The regulators power components that are "not (fully) described" in the device tree, meaning the kernel doesn't know all their consumers, so it's safer to keep them always on.
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) are also device tree changes marking regulators as always-on to prevent hardware issues. This is a common pattern in ARM device trees.
  4. **No security boundary crossing**: There's no privilege escalation, memory corruption, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issue being fixed. It's purely about ensuring proper hardware operation.
  5. **System stability, not security**: The issue being prevented is that these regulators might get disabled during probe defer or suspend operations, which could cause system instability or hardware malfunction, but not a security vulnerability.
  The commit follows the same pattern as multiple other commits by the same author across various x1e80100/x1e78100 devices, all marking the same l12b and l15b regulators as always-on. This indicates it's a platform-specific hardware requirement rather than a security issue.
abf89bc4bb09c arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100-crd: mark l12b and l15b always-on
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds `regulator-always-on` properties to two voltage regulators (l12b and l15b) in a device tree file. This is a hardware configuration change, not a fix for a security vulnerability.
  2. **Hardware description issue**: The commit message clearly states these regulators power "components that are not (fully) described (and some never will be)" - this indicates incomplete hardware description in the device tree, not a security flaw.
  3. **Preventive configuration**: The change prevents these regulators from being disabled during normal operation (probe defer or suspend), which could cause system instability but not a security compromise.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they show the same pattern - adding `regulator-always-on` to prevent voltage rails from being incorrectly disabled. None of these were assigned CVEs.
  5. **No security impact**: There's no indication of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Remote code execution
     - Any other security-relevant impact
  This is a functional correctness fix that ensures proper hardware operation by keeping critical power supplies enabled, similar to the qrb4210-rb2 commit in the reference examples which also marked a regulator as always-on to prevent undervolting.
fbf5e007588f3 arm64: dts: qcom: Commonize X1 CRD DTSI
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. This is a pure device tree refactoring change that:
  1. **No security vulnerability fix**: The commit simply extracts common device tree configuration from `x1e80100-crd.dts` into a new shared file `x1-crd.dtsi` to enable reuse across different X1 SKU variants.
  2. **Pure structural reorganization**: The changes involve:
     - Moving ~1270 lines of device tree configuration from `x1e80100-crd.dts` to `x1-crd.dtsi`
     - Having `x1e80100-crd.dts` include the new shared file
     - Adding a reference to `gpu_zap_shader` in `x1e80100.dtsi`
  3. **No security-relevant patterns**: The code changes show no evidence of:
     - Buffer overflow fixes
     - Memory leak fixes
     - Access control changes
     - Input validation improvements
     - Race condition fixes
     - Privilege escalation fixes
  4. **Maintenance/reusability improvement**: As stated in the commit message, this is done because "Certain X1 SKUs vary very noticeably, but the CRDs based on them don't", so the common parts are being factored out for reuse.
  This is a typical device tree maintenance commit that improves code organization and reusability, with no security implications whatsoever.
8724a5380c439 drm/amd/display: Fix mpv playback corruption on weston
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this should be assigned a CVE:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a display rendering bug that causes video playback corruption when using mpv with weston compositor. The issue is that the SURFACE_PIXEL_FORMAT_GRPH_ABGR16161616 format was not being properly mapped to the dml2_444_64 internal format in the display memory layout (DML) subsystem.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The bug causes incorrect pixel format mapping, leading to visual corruption during video playback
     - When ABGR16161616 format is used but not recognized, it falls through to the default case and gets mapped to dml2_444_32 (32-bit) instead of dml2_444_64 (64-bit)
     - This is a functional bug affecting display quality, not a security issue
  3. **No security implications**:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflows
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond visual corruption
     - The issue is limited to incorrect rendering/display output
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: This commit follows the pattern of the "NO CVE" reference commits which fix display issues, codec support, and rendering problems without security implications.
  The commit simply adds a missing case statement to properly handle a pixel format that was already defined in the system but not properly translated in the DML2 layer, resulting in visual artifacts but no security vulnerability.
3251b69b7efb8 drm/amd/display: Add dc cap for dp tunneling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit adds support for DP tunneling capabilities by:
     - Adding capability fields (`num_of_host_routers`, `num_of_dpias_per_host_router`) to track hardware configuration
     - Tracking the lowest DPIA link index (`lowest_dpia_link_index`) 
     - Adding a helper function `dc_get_host_router_index()` to calculate host router indices
  2. **Safety Checks Present**: The `dc_get_host_router_index()` function includes proper validation:
     - Checks if the link is a DPIA endpoint type
     - Validates that `link_index >= lowest_dpia_link_index` before calculation
     - Validates the calculated host router index is within bounds (`< num_of_host_routers`)
     - Returns false on any validation failure
  3. **No Division by Zero Risk**: All resource files initialize `num_of_dpias_per_host_router` to 2, preventing division by zero in line 6406.
  4. **Feature Addition, Not Bug Fix**: This is adding new functionality for DP tunneling support, not fixing a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's adding "dc cap for dp tunneling" and a function to get host router indices.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This commit pattern is similar to the first two example commits which added hardware configuration/feature support and were marked as NO CVE.
  The commit appears to be a safe feature addition with appropriate bounds checking and no security implications.
0d57dd1765d31 drm/amd/display: Add more checks for DSC / HUBP ONO guarantees
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **System Hang Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states that incorrect power domain configuration can cause "the logic to the tile to enter an undefined state leading to a **system hang**". System hangs are considered security vulnerabilities as they can lead to denial of service attacks.
  2. **Power Management Bug with Security Implications**: The code changes fix a power management bug where DSC (Display Stream Compression) instances could operate without the required HUBP (Hub Pipe) domain being powered on. This type of hardware state mismatch can lead to undefined behavior and system instability.
  3. **Similar to Previous CVE-Worthy Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 3 (drm/ast: Fix soft lockup) was assigned a CVE for fixing an infinite loop that could cause soft lockup
     - Commit 5 (drm/amd/display: Fix late derefrence 'dsc' check) was assigned a CVE for fixing a NULL pointer dereference
  4. **Critical Code Changes**: The fix adds power management checks in two critical functions (`dcn35_calc_blocks_to_gate` and `dcn35_calc_blocks_to_ungate`) that ensure all HUBP/DPP instances are powered when DSC instance doesn't match HUBP instance. This prevents the hardware from entering an undefined state.
  5. **Stable Kernel Backport**: The commit includes `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`, indicating it's a critical fix that needs to be backported to stable kernels, which is typical for security-relevant fixes.
  The vulnerability allows a local attacker with access to display configuration to potentially trigger a system hang by creating specific DSC/HUBP configuration mismatches, resulting in a denial of service condition.
854171405e7f0 drm/amdgpu: add kicker fws loading for gfx11/smu13/psp13
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: This commit adds support for loading alternative "kicker" firmware files for specific AMD GPU devices (device ID 0x744B, revision 0x00). It's a feature addition, not a security fix.
  2. **Proper Error Handling Maintained**: The code properly checks for errors after firmware loading attempts:
     - In `psp_init_sos_microcode()`: `if (err) goto out;`
     - In `psp_init_ta_microcode()`: `if (err) return err;`
     - Error handling paths are preserved from the original code
  3. **No Memory Safety Issues**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commit (a0a455b4bc74) which fixed an invalid memory access by properly handling firmware load failures, this commit doesn't introduce or fix any memory safety issues.
  4. **Feature Addition Pattern**: The commit follows a simple pattern:
     - Check if device is a "kicker" device using `amdgpu_is_kicker_fw()`
     - Load `*_kicker.bin` firmware files for kicker devices
     - Load regular `*.bin` firmware files for non-kicker devices
  5. **MODULE_FIRMWARE Declarations**: The MODULE_FIRMWARE entries are informational macros that help tools identify which firmware files a kernel module may need. They don't affect runtime security.
  The commit is marked for stable@ likely because it adds hardware support that should be backported to stable kernels for proper device functionality, not because it fixes a security issue.
ebe43542702c3 drm/amdgpu: switch job hw_fence to amdgpu_fence
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a type confusion vulnerability that can lead to memory corruption. Here's the specific evidence:
  1. **Type Confusion Issue**: The commit message explicitly states "This also fixes the start_time handling for MCBP since we were casting the fence to an amdgpu_fence and it wasn't." This indicates that the code was incorrectly casting a `dma_fence` to an `amdgpu_fence` when it was actually just a plain `dma_fence`.
  2. **Memory Corruption Risk**: In the MCBP code (amdgpu_fence_update_start_timestamp), the function calls `to_amdgpu_fence(fence)->start_timestamp = timestamp`. If the fence is not actually an amdgpu_fence structure, this write operation would corrupt memory beyond the actual fence structure, potentially overwriting critical data.
  3. **Security Impact**: The type confusion can lead to:
     - Out-of-bounds memory writes when accessing the `start_timestamp` field
     - Potential privilege escalation if the corrupted memory contains security-sensitive data
     - System instability or crashes
  4. **Pattern Matches CVE-Worthy Issues**: Similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the examples:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed a use-after-free by checking fence initialization
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) fixed fence reference counting issues
     - This commit fixes a type safety issue that leads to memory corruption
  The fix properly changes `hw_fence` from a plain `dma_fence` to an `amdgpu_fence` structure, ensuring that the cast operations are valid and preventing the memory corruption vulnerability.
7f3b16f3f229e drm/amdgpu: Fix SDMA UTC_L1 handling during start/stop sequences
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a driver initialization/configuration bug where:
     - The UTC_L1 (Unified Translation Cache Level 1) enable bit was being set but not written back to the hardware register during SDMA start
     - The UTC_L1 bit was not being properly disabled during SDMA stop
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug affects internal hardware configuration of the GPU's DMA engine cache settings. There's no evidence this could be exploited to:
     - Gain elevated privileges
     - Access unauthorized memory regions
     - Bypass security controls
     - Cause denial of service from unprivileged contexts
  3. **Hardware configuration issue**: UTC_L1 is a performance optimization feature for the GPU's internal memory translation cache. The missing register write would mean the cache might not be properly enabled/disabled, potentially affecting performance or stability, but not security.
  4. **Similar commit analysis**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Commits with "CVE Status: YES" fixed signedness bugs that could lead to out-of-bounds access
     - This commit only fixes missing register writes for hardware configuration
  5. **No exploitable condition**: The code path is only executed during driver initialization/shutdown sequences, which require privileged access to begin with. An unprivileged user cannot trigger these code paths.
c464ce6af332e drm/i915/dsi: Fix off by one in BXT_MIPI_TRANS_VTOTAL
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the additional context gathered:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is an off-by-one error in display timing register programming for the Intel i915 driver on Broxton/Geminilake platforms. The code changes show:
  1. In `bxt_dsi_get_pipe_config()`: Adding `+ 1` when reading the BXT_MIPI_TRANS_VTOTAL register (line 1059)
  2. In `set_dsi_timings()`: Subtracting `- 1` when writing to BXT_MIPI_TRANS_VTOTAL register (line 1263)
  This is a functional bug fix that corrects display timing calculations. The security implications are minimal because:
  - It only affects display vertical timing parameters, not memory management or access control
  - The bug would cause display artifacts or incorrect mode settings, not memory corruption
  - There's no privilege escalation or information disclosure vector
  - The impact is limited to display functionality on specific Intel platforms (Broxton/Geminilake)
  The commit is marked with `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org` to ensure the fix reaches stable kernels for reliability reasons, not security concerns. This aligns with the similar non-CVE commits shown in the historical examples, which also fixed display timing and configuration issues without security implications.
a39d082c3553d drm/xe: Fix early wedge on GuC load failure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit message and code changes, along with the security analysis from the kernel tree:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Kernel Panic/DoS**: The bug causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference and system crash when GuC firmware fails to load early, as shown in the commit message:
     ```
     BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
     #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
     ```
  2. **Memory Safety Violation**: The code attempts to access uninitialized data structures in GT1 when GT0's GuC load fails, potentially leading to memory corruption. The wedge code tries to:
     - Access uninitialized CT (Command Transport) state
     - Process non-existent TLB invalidation fence lists
     - Lock uninitialized mutexes
  3. **Security-Sensitive Code Path**: The wedge functionality is a critical error handling mechanism that:
     - Stops all GPU submission
     - Blocks all IOCTLs
     - Handles security-sensitive operations like TLB invalidations
  4. **Similar to CVE-Assigned Commits**: The two similar commits shown both have "CVE Status: YES" and fix NULL pointer dereferences in the same xe driver's TLB invalidation code path.
  5. **Stable Backport**: The commit explicitly marks it for stable kernel backport (v6.12+), indicating it's a serious issue that needs to be fixed in production kernels.
  The fix adds proper initialization checks (`xe_guc_ct_initialized()` and `guc->submission_state.initialized`) to prevent accessing uninitialized structures during the wedge operation, eliminating the crash and potential memory corruption vulnerability.
1e1981b16bb1b drm/xe: Fix taking invalid lock on wedge
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me provide the CVE assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a bug where an uninitialized mutex lock is accessed during device wedging, but this is **not a security vulnerability**. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The bug causes a kernel warning/splat when trying to lock an uninitialized mutex if the device wedges before GuC submission state initialization. This is a **reliability/stability issue**, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: 
     - The issue doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure
     - It's a defensive programming fix to handle an edge case gracefully
     - The worst outcome is a kernel warning and potential system instability, not a security breach
  3. **Limited attack surface**:
     - The wedge condition typically occurs due to hardware failures or driver initialization failures
     - An attacker cannot reliably trigger this condition to exploit the system
     - The issue only manifests during early initialization failures (e.g., GuC upload failure)
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**:
     - The similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" fix actual **use-after-free (UAF)** vulnerabilities that could lead to memory corruption
     - This commit merely adds a check to prevent accessing an uninitialized lock structure
  5. **Code analysis**: The fix simply adds:
     - An `initialized` flag to track when the submission state is ready
     - An early return in `xe_guc_submit_wedge()` if the state isn't initialized
     - This prevents the `mutex_lock(&guc->submission_state.lock)` call on an uninitialized mutex
  The commit is a proper defensive fix for a potential crash/warning scenario but doesn't address any security vulnerability.
87a15c89d8c7b drm/xe: Fix memset on iomem
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
b669507b637eb drm/amd/display: Check dce_hwseq before dereferencing it
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Null Pointer Dereference**: The code shows a clear null pointer dereference vulnerability. In line 1229, `hws->funcs.edp_backlight_control(link, false)` is called, but `hws` could be NULL as evidenced by the check on line 1224 (`if (hws && hws->wa_state.skip_blank_stream)`).
  2. **Security Impact**: This vulnerability could lead to a kernel panic/crash when:
     - The display subsystem attempts to blank an eDP (embedded DisplayPort) stream
     - The `hwseq` pointer is NULL (potentially due to initialization failures or race conditions)
     - The system tries to control the backlight on eDP displays
  3. **Exploitability**: While this appears to require specific hardware (eDP displays) and specific conditions, it could potentially be triggered by:
     - Display hotplug events
     - Power management transitions
     - Display mode changes
  4. **Similar CVE Precedent**: The similar commits shown all received CVE assignments for comparable null pointer dereference issues in the AMD display driver, particularly in display control and validation functions.
  5. **Stable Backport**: The commit includes `Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`, indicating the maintainers consider this a bug serious enough to backport to stable kernels, which is typical for security fixes.
  The fix correctly adds a null check (`&& hws`) before dereferencing `hws->funcs.edp_backlight_control`, preventing the potential kernel crash.
0bbf5fd86c585 drm/amdgpu: Add kicker device detection
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the kernel code, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds new functionality for device detection and firmware loading for "kicker" variants of AMD GPUs. It does not fix any security vulnerability but rather adds support for loading different firmware files for specific hardware variants.
  2. **Kicker devices are hardware variants**: From examining the historical commits, "kicker" refers to specific revisions or variants of AMD GPUs that require different firmware. For example, there are Polaris kickers, SI kickers, and now GFX11 kickers. These are legitimate hardware variations that need different firmware binaries.
  3. **The code changes are feature additions**: 
     - Adds a device detection list with device ID 0x744B
     - Adds a helper function `amdgpu_is_kicker_fw()` to check if a device is a kicker variant
     - The subsequent commit shows this is used to load alternative firmware files (e.g., `_kicker.bin` variants)
  4. **No security-sensitive patterns**:
     - No buffer overflow fixes
     - No memory leak fixes
     - No access control changes
     - No input validation improvements
     - No race condition fixes
     - No privilege escalation fixes
  5. **Similar to previous non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits, other kicker-related changes (like polaris kickers, SI kickers) were also not assigned CVEs because they are hardware enablement features, not security fixes.
  The commit is marked for stable backporting (`Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org`), but this is likely for hardware support consistency across kernel versions, not for security reasons.
46e15197b513e drm/amdgpu: VCN v5_0_1 to prevent FW checking RB during DPG pause
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my security assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a timing/synchronization issue during VCN (Video Core Next) hardware initialization, specifically during DPG (Dynamic Power Gating) pause mode. The change moves setting the `FW_QUEUE_RING_RESET` flag earlier in the initialization sequence to prevent firmware from checking the ring buffer while it's being reset.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The race condition involves internal hardware/firmware synchronization during normal driver operations. There's no indication that this could be exploited by an attacker to:
     - Gain elevated privileges
     - Access unauthorized memory
     - Cause denial of service beyond normal driver bugs
     - Bypass security controls
  3. **Limited impact**: The commit message describes this as a "WA (workaround) for an unintended VCPU running" - this appears to be a functional correctness issue where the video processing unit might start execution prematurely during initialization, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE patterns**: Looking at similar commits in the VCN driver history (like commit 2 in the examples), many synchronization and timing fixes in GPU drivers are treated as regular bug fixes rather than security issues.
  5. **No exploitation vector**: The code path is in hardware initialization routines that execute during driver startup. There's no user-controllable input that could trigger or exploit this race condition.
  The fix is a proper ordering of operations to ensure the firmware doesn't access ring buffer structures while they're being initialized/reset, which is a standard driver reliability improvement rather than a security fix.
158f9944ac05d drm/amd/display: Fix RMCM programming seq errors
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The code change adds a bounds check to prevent a potential negative value calculation when `*p->tdlut_bytes_per_frame <= p->cursor_buffer_size * 1024`. The original code would calculate a negative value in the expression `(*p->tdlut_bytes_per_frame - p->cursor_buffer_size * 1024)`, which could lead to incorrect timing calculations.
  2. **Display Timing Issue, Not Security**: This is a fix for RMCM (Rate Management and Color Management) programming sequence errors in AMD's display driver. The issue affects display rendering correctness and test compliance, not system security.
  3. **No Exploitable Condition**: The code operates in the display controller's DML (Display Mode Library) calculations for 3D look-up tables (TDLUT). There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service potential
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, display timing and calculation fixes (like Similar Commit 1 and 2) are consistently marked as NO CVE, while actual security issues like buffer underflow/corruption (Similar Commit 3) receive CVEs.
  The fix simply ensures that `tdlut_opt_time` is set to 0 when the calculated value would be negative, preventing incorrect display timing calculations. This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
2e824747cfbdf drm/xe/guc_submit: add back fix
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  While this commit does fix a use-after-free (UAF) issue, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Not a new vulnerability fix**: This is re-adding a fix that was already present (commit 2d2be279f1ca "drm/xe: fix UAF around queue destruction") but was accidentally removed during a merge conflict resolution. The original UAF vulnerability was already fixed.
  2. **Regression fix**: This is fixing a regression introduced by the merge commit ac44ff7cec33. The security vulnerability was already known and fixed - this is just restoring that fix after it was inadvertently removed.
  3. **Code analysis shows the fix**: The commit adds back the critical synchronization code in `guc_submit_fini()` that:
     - Waits for all exec queues to be removed (via `wait_event_timeout`)
     - Drains the destroy workqueue to ensure no work items are still running
     - Adds proper assertions to catch issues
  4. **The UAF mechanism**: Without this fix, asynchronous work items queued on `xe->destroy_wq` (in `guc_exec_queue_fini_async`) could still be running when the driver is being torn down, leading to access of freed memory when those work items execute.
  Since this is restoring a previously applied security fix rather than addressing a new vulnerability, it should not receive a new CVE. The original fix (if it addressed a security issue at the time) might have warranted a CVE, but this restoration does not.

893f07452bca5 drm/amd/display: Correct non-OLED pre_T11_delay.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a display timing correction for non-OLED panels, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit corrects incorrect delay values that were being applied to non-OLED panels.
  2. **Code changes analysis**:
     - The change modifies `pre_T11_delay` and `post_T7_delay` from always being set to `OLED_PRE_T11_DELAY` (150ms) and `OLED_POST_T7_DELAY` (100ms) respectively, to only applying these delays when the panel is actually OLED (`link->dpcd_sink_ext_caps.bits.oled`).
     - For non-OLED panels, the delays are now set to 0.
     - An additional check `if (pre_T11_delay)` is added before calling `msleep()` to avoid unnecessary delays.
  3. **Security impact**: There is no security vulnerability being fixed here. The commit addresses:
     - A performance/timing issue where non-OLED panels were unnecessarily waiting for OLED-specific delays
     - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control issues
     - No privilege escalation or information disclosure vulnerabilities
     - No race conditions or input validation problems
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 2 (CVE Status: YES) fixed bounds checking issues that could lead to OVERRUN and INTEGER_OVERFLOW
     - This commit merely adjusts timing delays and has no such security implications
  The commit is a display driver optimization/correction that ensures proper panel power sequencing timing for different panel types, with no security ramifications.
5cccf10f65212 drm/amdgpu: disable workload profile switching when OD is enabled
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is addressing a stability/performance issue, not a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states that users need to "reduce the level of undervolting to achieve stability" when dynamic workload profiles are enabled with overclocking/undervolting (OD).
  2. **Feature interaction issue**: The change disables dynamic workload profile switching when overdrive (OD) is enabled. This is a compatibility fix between two performance features - it prevents instability that occurs when both features are used together.
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: The code changes show:
     - Adding checks for `amdgpu_dpm_is_overdrive_enabled()` in `amdgpu_gfx_profile_ring_begin_use()` and `amdgpu_gfx_profile_ring_end_use()`
     - These simply skip workload profile switching when OD is active
     - No privilege escalation, memory corruption, or security bypass is involved
  4. **User-controlled feature**: Overdrive (OD) is a user-enabled feature for overclocking/undervolting. The instability mentioned is a result of users pushing their hardware beyond factory specifications, not a security flaw.
  5. **Similar to historical commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve power profile management and workload switching adjustments for performance optimization, none of which were assigned CVEs.
  The commit is fixing a stability issue that occurs when users combine overclocking/undervolting with dynamic workload profile switching - this is a performance/stability fix, not a security vulnerability fix.
4d2f6b4e4c7ed drm/amdgpu: amdgpu_vram_mgr_new(): Clamp lpfn to total vram
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This commit fixes a compatibility issue between the old drm_mm allocator and the new drm_buddy allocator. The issue is that drm_buddy validates that `end > mm->size` and returns `-EINVAL`, while the old drm_mm allocator tolerated this condition.
  2. **Functional regression, not security**: The code change simply clamps the `lpfn` (last page frame number) parameter to ensure it doesn't exceed the total VRAM size:
     ```c
     if (!lpfn || lpfn > man->size)
         lpfn = man->size;
     ```
  3. **No security impact**: 
     - This doesn't fix a memory corruption issue
     - No buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No information disclosure
     - It's just ensuring a parameter stays within valid bounds for compatibility
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-4 all dealt with memory accounting and allocation in the same subsystem but were marked as "CVE Status: NO"
     - Only commit 5 (fixing a memory leak) was assigned a CVE
     - This commit is more similar to commits 1-4 in nature
  5. **Purpose is compatibility**: The commit message explicitly states it's restoring "pre-buddy-allocator behavior" - this is about maintaining compatibility with existing code that may have passed invalid parameters that were previously tolerated.
  The change is a defensive programming practice to handle edge cases gracefully, not a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability.
c3e9826a22027 drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check for get_first_active_display()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Null Pointer Dereference**: The commit fixes a null pointer dereference vulnerability. The function `mod_hdcp_hdcp1_enable_encryption()` calls `get_first_active_display()` but failed to check if it returned NULL before using the `display` pointer.
  2. **Security Impact**: Without the null check, the code would attempt to dereference the null pointer at two locations:
     - `display->state = MOD_HDCP_DISPLAY_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED;` (line 386)
     - `HDCP_HDCP1_ENABLED_TRACE(hdcp, display->index);` (line 387)
  3. **Exploitable Condition**: The vulnerability can be triggered when the display list is empty, which could occur in specific system configurations or during certain state transitions.
  4. **Security Component**: This affects HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection), which is a security-related component responsible for protecting digital content from unauthorized copying.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commits 1, 2, 3, and 5 all received CVEs for adding null pointer checks
     - They follow the same pattern: checking for null pointers before dereferencing them
     - This commit has the exact same vulnerability pattern
  6. **Stable Backport**: The commit is marked for stable backport (`Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v5.8`), indicating it's a significant bug fix that affects multiple kernel versions.
  The commit prevents a kernel crash/panic that could be triggered by specific display configurations, making it a security vulnerability that warrants CVE assignment.
47c03e6660e96 drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Wait for Clk and Data Lanes to be ready
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a timing/synchronization issue where the DSI (Display Serial Interface) driver needs to wait for clock and data lanes to be ready before continuing configuration. This is a functional correctness fix, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Impact is Limited to Display Corruption**: The commit message clearly states that the impact is "a color-shift on the display" when the lanes aren't ready. This is a visual display issue, not a security concern. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - System crash/DoS potential
     - Access control bypass
  3. **Code Changes Show Timing Fix**: The code adds a polling wait (`readl_poll_timeout`) to ensure the CLK_LANE_RDY and DATA_LANE_RDY status bits are set before proceeding. This is a proper initialization sequence correction as per the TI J721E SoC documentation.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1: Fixed DSI command transmission timing - NO CVE
     - Similar Commit 2: Fixed DPHY initialization order - NO CVE  
     - Similar Commit 5: Fixed PHY lock bit check - NO CVE
  All these are timing/initialization fixes in display drivers without security implications, just like this commit.
  The fix ensures proper hardware initialization sequencing to avoid display artifacts, which is a quality/functionality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
c6a7ef0d4856b drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Check return value when getting default PHY config
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to determine the security implications of not checking the return value from `phy_mipi_dphy_get_default_config`.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The change adds error checking for `phy_mipi_dphy_get_default_config()`, which is a hardening improvement but does not fix an actual security vulnerability. The function can only fail if:
     - `cfg` is NULL (which it isn't in this case - it's `&output->phy_opts.mipi_dphy`)
     - Division by zero if `lanes` is 0
  2. **Limited Impact**: Looking at the code flow, if `lanes` were 0, it would cause a kernel division by zero error (kernel panic/oops), not a memory corruption or privilege escalation vulnerability. This would be a denial of service at worst, but:
     - The `lanes` value comes from DRM/display configuration
     - It's typically validated during device initialization
     - An invalid display configuration causing a crash is more of a robustness issue than a security vulnerability
  3. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Comparing to the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 3 (drm/msm/dsi: Add check for devm_kstrdup()) was marked NO CVE - it added a NULL check for memory allocation failure
     - Similar Commit 5 (phy: cadence-torrent: Check return value on register read) was marked NO CVE - it added error checking for a register read operation
     
     Both of these are similar error checking improvements that don't fix actual security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Not Remotely Exploitable**: This requires local access to configure display settings with invalid parameters, making it at most a local DoS issue, which typically doesn't warrant a CVE unless there are additional security implications.
  The commit is a good defensive programming practice and improves code robustness, but it does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant CVE assignment.
688eb4d465484 drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Fix connecting to next bridge
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Looking at the commit message and the code change:
  The bug is in the cdns_dsi_attach() function. The code looks up the OF node pointer `np` which represents the next entity in the device tree chain (either through OF-graph or from the DSI device's of_node). It uses this to find a panel first with `of_drm_find_panel(np)`. 
  However, when trying to find a bridge (non-panel), the original code incorrectly used:
  ```c
  bridge = of_drm_find_bridge(dev->dev.of_node);
  ```
  But it should use:
  ```c
  bridge = of_drm_find_bridge(np);
  ```
  The issue is that `dev->dev.of_node` refers to the DSI device's node, while `np` refers to the next entity in the pipeline that was just looked up. Using `dev->dev.of_node` would try to find a bridge for the DSI device itself rather than the next bridge in the chain.
  **CVE Decision: NO**
  This is a functional bug that prevents proper bridge discovery in the display pipeline, but it does not have security implications:
  1. **No memory corruption**: The bug simply passes the wrong OF node pointer to a lookup function, resulting in failure to find the correct bridge.
  2. **No privilege escalation**: This doesn't allow unauthorized access or privilege elevation.
  3. **No data exposure**: No sensitive information is leaked.
  4. **No system compromise**: The worst case is that the display pipeline fails to initialize properly when using non-panel bridges.
  5. **Functional impact only**: This is a configuration/initialization bug that affects display functionality but has no security ramifications.
  The similar commits show that functional bugs in DRM bridge code (like commits 1 and 2) typically don't get CVEs, while actual security issues like null pointer dereferences (commits 3, 4, 5) or use-after-free vulnerabilities do get CVEs. This commit falls into the former category - it's a functional bug without security implications.
fd2611c13f69c drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Fix phy de-init and flag it so
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: The issue is a functional bug in the display driver's power management, not a security vulnerability. The driver fails to properly clear the `phy_initialized` flag during suspend, causing it to skip PHY re-initialization after resume.
  2. **Impact Analysis**: 
     - The bug causes the display to stop working after suspend/resume cycles
     - This is a denial of service in the sense that the display becomes non-functional
     - However, it requires local physical access to trigger suspend/resume
     - There's no privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure
  3. **Code Context**: Looking at the code changes:
     - The fix adds proper cleanup in `cdns_dsi_bridge_atomic_post_disable()`: `phy_power_off()`, `phy_exit()`, and clearing flags
     - The `cdns_dsi_hs_init()` function checks `if (dsi->phy_initialized) return;` - this is where the bug manifests
     - Without clearing the flag, the driver incorrectly thinks the PHY is already initialized after resume
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: The similar commits provided (NO CVE status) also deal with:
     - PHY initialization/power management issues
     - Suspend/resume functionality problems  
     - Hardware state management bugs
  5. **Security Relevance**: This is purely a reliability/functionality issue. While it renders the display unusable, it:
     - Doesn't allow unauthorized access
     - Doesn't leak sensitive information
     - Doesn't corrupt memory or allow code execution
     - Only affects the local system's display subsystem
  This is a typical driver bug that affects functionality but does not cross the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
132bdcec399be drm/bridge: cdns-dsi: Fix the clock variable for mode_valid()
- [sasha] Let me analyze what I've found:
  Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: This is a functional bug in the display driver's mode validation logic, not a security vulnerability. The issue is that during mode validation (before mode is actually set), the driver incorrectly uses `mode->crtc_clock` which hasn't been populated yet, instead of `mode->clock`.
  2. **Impact**: The bug causes valid display modes to be rejected during the validation phase, resulting in displays not working properly or certain resolutions being unavailable. This is a functional regression, not a security issue.
  3. **No Security Implications**: 
     - No memory corruption or overflow
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No information disclosure
     - No access control bypass
     - Simply causes mode validation to fail incorrectly
  4. **Code Pattern**: The fix shows the driver already had the correct pattern everywhere else (using `mode->clock` during validation and `mode->crtc_clock` during actual mode setting). This was just one inconsistent location that was missed.
  5. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 & 2 (drm/crtc fixes) were marked "NO" for CVE and dealt with variable initialization issues
     - Commit 4 (mode_valid validation) was marked "NO" for CVE and also dealt with display validation logic
     - Only Commit 3 got a CVE because it fixed a NULL pointer dereference
  This commit is purely a display functionality fix with no security ramifications.
9cb15478916e8 drm/i915/dp_mst: Work around Thunderbolt sink disconnect after SINK_COUNT_ESI read
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me check the original code behavior:
  Based on my analysis of the commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Hardware/Firmware Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: The commit works around a firmware bug in the Intel Thunderbolt (iTBT) DP-in adapter that causes unintended disconnections when reading certain registers in a single AUX transaction. This is not a security vulnerability but a functional issue.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The code change splits a single 4-byte read operation (addresses 0x2002-0x2005) into two separate reads:
     - First read: 3 bytes from DP_SINK_COUNT_ESI (0x2002-0x2004)  
     - Second read: 1 byte from DP_LINK_SERVICE_IRQ_VECTOR_ESI0 (0x2005)
     
     This prevents the firmware bug from triggering an inadvertent disconnect but doesn't fix any security issue.
  3. **Display Functionality Issue Only**: The worst-case scenario is that the display/monitor gets disconnected unexpectedly due to the firmware bug. This affects user experience but has no security implications like:
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond display disconnection
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, particularly "drm/i915/dp_mst: Fix MST state after a sink reset" (CVE Status: NO), which also deals with display connection issues and MST state management, reinforces that display connectivity issues are not considered security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Platform-Specific Workaround**: The workaround is specifically limited to certain Intel platforms (MTL/ARL/LNL) and is a temporary measure until the firmware is fixed, further indicating this is a hardware compatibility issue rather than a security concern.
  The commit is properly tagged for stable kernels (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org) because it fixes a functional bug that affects user experience, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it addresses no security vulnerability.
a38b3232d6186 drm/i915/ptl: Use everywhere the correct DDI port clock select mask
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a display driver issue where the wrong bit mask size (4 bits instead of 5 bits) was used for the DDI clock select field on PTL (Panther Lake) platforms. The changes:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a hardware register programming error that could cause incorrect clock configuration on PTL displays. The code changes introduce platform-aware macros (`XELPDP_DDI_CLOCK_SELECT_MASK`, `XELPDP_DDI_CLOCK_SELECT_PREP`, `XELPDP_DDI_CLOCK_SELECT_GET`) that use the correct mask size based on display version.
  2. **Security impact**: None identified. This is a functional fix for display clock configuration that could cause display instability or incorrect behavior, but:
     - No memory safety issues
     - No privilege escalation possibilities
     - No information disclosure
     - No access control bypass
     - Limited to display subsystem functionality
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits show other display driver fixes (port width programming, register macro usage, integer overflow prevention) that were also marked as "NO" for CVE assignment despite being marked for stable backports.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for newer hardware support but doesn't meet the criteria for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
cfb05257ae168 drm/amdkfd: Fix race in GWS queue scheduling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: This is a race condition in queue scheduling that leads to a scheduler hang, not a security vulnerability. The issue occurs when:
     - `q->gws` is not updated atomically with `qpd->mapped_gws_queue`
     - A runlist is created between `pqm_set_gws` and `update_queue` operations
     - This results in a queue using GWS (Global Wave Sync) in a process with no GWS allocated
  2. **Impact Analysis**: The commit message clearly states this results in a "scheduler hang" - this is a denial of service/reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
  3. **Fix Details**: The fix simply changes from using `q->gws` to `q->properties.is_gws` when setting the `gws_control_queue` flag. The commit message notes that `q->properties.is_gws` is "changed while holding the DQM lock," providing proper synchronization.
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commits 1-4 (marked NO CVE) deal with race conditions and synchronization issues in the scheduler
     - Commit 5 (marked YES CVE) involves a use-after-free bug with actual memory corruption potential
     
     This commit is more similar to commits 1-4 in that it's a synchronization/race condition issue without security implications.
  5. **Code Context**: The change is in packet manager code that builds hardware command packets. The incorrect GWS flag would cause incorrect hardware scheduling but not a security breach.
  This is a functional bug fix for a race condition that causes system hangs, not a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
b71717735be48 drm/msm/gpu: Fix crash when throttling GPU immediately during boot
- [sasha] NO
  This commit fixes a boot-time crash that occurs under specific environmental conditions (GPU already hot during boot), but it does not represent a security vulnerability warranting a CVE. The issue is:
  1. **Environmental trigger**: The crash only happens when the GPU is already hot during boot - not something an attacker can reliably control
  2. **No privilege escalation**: The crash is a NULL pointer dereference when accessing uninitialized GMU registers, with no path to code execution or privilege escalation
  3. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a reliability issue where the `df->suspended` flag doesn't match the actual devfreq state after initialization
  4. **Limited impact**: Results in a boot-time kernel crash (DoS) only under specific hardware conditions
  The fix simply ensures `df->suspended = true` is set during initialization to match the devfreq_suspend_device() call, preventing the inappropriate GMU register access. This is a robustness improvement rather than a security fix.
ff9cb6d2035c5 drm/udl: Unregister device before cleaning up on disconnect
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the reference commits, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability but rather addresses a quality/reliability issue. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: The error messages shown in the commit are:
     - `-115` (EINPROGRESS) errors from USB URB completions
     - `-2` (ENOENT) errors from `usb_submit_urb`
     
     These indicate that the USB device is already disconnected when the poll helpers try to communicate with it, causing error messages but not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No memory corruption or access control issues**: Unlike the streamzap commit (CVE Status: YES) which fixed a race condition leading to a NULL pointer dereference and potential memory corruption, this commit only reorders operations to prevent harmless error messages.
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (udl DRM_CONNECTOR_POLL_HPD removal): NO CVE - just a configuration fix
     - Similar Commit 4 (udl USB timeout constant): NO CVE - just a consistency improvement
     - This commit similarly just improves shutdown ordering
  4. **Code change analysis**: The change simply moves `drm_dev_unplug(dev)` before `drm_kms_helper_poll_fini(dev)`. The `drm_dev_unplug()` function sets `dev->unplugged = true` which polling code checks gracefully, preventing the error messages. This is a quality improvement, not a security fix.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: The issue doesn't create any exploitable condition - it just generates error messages during device disconnect. The polling code already handles disconnected devices gracefully when properly marked as unplugged.
780351a5f6141 drm/tegra: Fix a possible null pointer dereference
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The code before the fix contains a clear NULL pointer dereference when `kzalloc()` fails due to memory pressure. The buggy code passes `&state->base` to `__drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset()` when `state` is NULL, which would cause a kernel crash when trying to compute the address of `base` field.
  2. **Triggered during driver operations**: The `tegra_crtc_reset()` function is called through the DRM framework during:
     - Driver initialization/probe
     - Mode configuration resets
     - Resume operations
     
  3. **Memory allocation can fail**: While rare, `kzalloc()` with `GFP_KERNEL` can fail under memory pressure conditions. The kernel is designed to handle such failures gracefully, not crash.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: This fix follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown that were assigned CVEs:
     - Checking for NULL after memory allocation
     - Preventing NULL pointer dereference
     - Fixing error handling in DRM subsystem
  5. **Security impact**: A NULL pointer dereference in kernel space leads to:
     - Kernel panic/crash
     - System denial of service
     - Potential for exploitation in some scenarios
  The fix correctly handles the NULL case by checking if `state` is allocated before use, and passing NULL to `__drm_atomic_helper_crtc_reset()` which is designed to handle NULL properly (as seen in line 96 of the helper function).
9ff4fdf4f44b6 drm/tegra: Assign plane type before registration
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a functional bug where the plane type was being changed after registration, which wouldn't propagate to userspace. However, this is not a security vulnerability for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The issue is about incorrect plane type information being exposed to userspace. While this could cause incorrect behavior in applications expecting proper plane type metadata, it doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Buffer overflows
     - Use-after-free conditions
  2. **Functional Fix Only**: The change moves the plane type assignment from after `tegra_shared_plane_create()` returns to being passed as a parameter during creation. This ensures the plane is registered with the correct type from the beginning. The old code did:
     ```c
     plane = tegra_shared_plane_create(...);
     if (!primary) {
         plane->type = DRM_PLANE_TYPE_PRIMARY;  // Changed after registration
         primary = plane;
     }
     ```
     The new code determines the type beforehand and passes it to the creation function.
  3. **No Resource Leaks or Corruption**: Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (like the STM and plane format_count commits), this doesn't fix any resource leaks, use-after-free conditions, or memory safety issues.
  4. **User-Visible Impact Only**: The worst impact would be applications seeing incorrect plane types, which could affect display functionality but poses no security risk.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for ensuring DRM plane metadata is correctly exposed to userspace, but it lacks the security implications necessary for CVE assignment.
d231cde7c8435 drm/simpledrm: Do not upcast in release helpers
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. In the original code:
  - `struct simpledrm_device` had `struct drm_device dev` as its first member
  - The `simpledrm_device_of_dev()` function was taking a `struct drm_device *` and using `container_of` to get the `simpledrm_device`
  - However, the release callbacks were being passed a `struct simpledrm_device *` directly (as the `res` parameter), not a `struct drm_device *`
  - The code was incorrectly calling `simpledrm_device_of_dev(res)` which was treating the `simpledrm_device *` as a `drm_device *`
  Since `drm_device` is the first member of `simpledrm_device`, the upcast was "harmless" because both pointers would have the same address. However, it's still incorrect code that could cause issues if the structure layout changed.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes incorrect pointer handling, the bug is harmless in practice because:
  1. The `struct drm_device` is the first member of `struct simpledrm_device`, so both pointers have the same address
  2. The commit message explicitly states "The upcast is harmless, as DRM device is the first field in struct simpledrm_device"
  3. This is a code correctness fix, not a security vulnerability fix
  4. There's no potential for memory corruption, privilege escalation, or other security impacts
  5. The change is purely cosmetic/correctness - removing an unnecessary and incorrect type conversion that happened to work due to struct layout
  This is similar to the first commit example in the historical references which also involved structure refactoring without security implications.
716c75afd83c8 drm/panel: simple: Tianma TM070JDHG34-00: add delays
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, I can now provide my assessment.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds power on/off timing delays to the Tianma TM070JDHG34-00 panel driver. These delays ensure proper power sequencing for the LCD panel hardware.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The code changes only add timing parameters:
     ```c
     +	.delay = {
     +		.prepare = 15,		/* Tp1 */
     +		.enable = 150,		/* Tp2 */
     +		.disable = 150,		/* Tp4 */
     +		.unprepare = 120,	/* Tp3 */
     +	},
     ```
  3. **Impact assessment**: Missing these delays could cause:
     - Display artifacts or flickering
     - Improper panel initialization
     - Potential hardware stress from improper power sequencing
     - Display functionality issues
  4. **Not a security issue**: The code analysis shows these delays are used in `msleep()` calls during panel power on/off sequences. There's no:
     - Memory corruption or overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Input validation issues
  5. **Similar commits pattern**: The historical similar commits provided (adding delays for BOE, Sitronix, and other panels) were all marked as "CVE Status: NO", which aligns with this being a hardware timing/functionality fix rather than a security fix.
  This is a standard hardware support fix to ensure proper operation of the display panel according to its specifications, not a security vulnerability fix.
61ee19dedb8d7 drm/etnaviv: Protect the scheduler's pending list with its lock
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, let me make a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a race condition but it is NOT a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a race condition in the etnaviv GPU driver's scheduler where accessing the `pending_list` without holding the `job_list_lock` could lead to list corruption when the scheduler's workqueues are running concurrently.
  2. **Limited Impact**: 
     - The race only occurs in the timeout handler path when the GPU is still making forward progress
     - It requires specific timing conditions (GPU timeout extension while scheduler workqueues are active)
     - Only affects the etnaviv GPU driver, which is used in embedded systems with Vivante GPUs
  3. **Not Exploitable**: 
     - This is a race condition that could cause system instability or crashes, but there's no evidence it can be exploited for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security attacks
     - The timing window is narrow and occurs only when the GPU appears to hang but is actually still processing
  4. **Similar to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (drm/xe, drm/panthor, drm/sched), they all fix scheduler-related race conditions and synchronization issues, and NONE were assigned CVEs. These are treated as stability/reliability fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Code Analysis**: The fix simply adds proper locking (`spin_lock`/`spin_unlock`) around the `list_add` operation, which is a standard synchronization fix for concurrent access to shared data structures.
  The issue could potentially cause a kernel crash or GPU driver malfunction due to list corruption, but this falls into the category of denial-of-service through bugs rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities. The kernel community typically doesn't assign CVEs to such race condition fixes unless they have clear security implications beyond system stability.
4bfb389a0136a drm/cirrus-qemu: Fix pitch programming
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's what I understand about this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No security vulnerability is being fixed** - The commit fixes incorrect programming of a display register (CR1B bit 6) that affects VGA text mode, not graphics mode operation.
  2. **Limited impact** - According to the commit message, CR1B[6] "effects VGA text mode and is not interpreted by qemu". The bit has no effect on the scanline pitch in graphics mode, which is what the driver uses.
  3. **Functional bug, not security bug** - This is a programming error where the wrong bit was being set in a control register. The bit that was incorrectly being set into CR1B[6] actually belongs in CR13[7], which the driver already sets correctly. This is a case of redundant/incorrect register programming rather than a vulnerability.
  4. **No exploitable condition** - There's no evidence this incorrect bit setting could lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Buffer overflows  
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
  5. **Virtual hardware only** - This driver is specifically for QEMU's emulated Cirrus graphics, not real hardware, and QEMU doesn't even interpret this bit according to the commit message.
  The commit is fixing a longstanding functional bug (dating back to the initial 2012 commit) where an incorrect register bit was being programmed, but this has no security implications.
7cce65f3789e0 drm/ast: Fix comment on modeset lock
- [sasha] Now let me examine the code changes in detail by looking at the diff provided:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Pure Documentation Fix**: This is solely a comment correction. The only change is updating an outdated/misleading comment from:
     ```
     * drm_connector_helper_funcs.get_modes by trying to read the
     * display modes. Protect access to I/O registers by acquiring  
     * the I/O-register lock. Released in atomic_flush().
     ```
     to:
     ```
     * drm_connector_helper_funcs.get_modes by reading the display
     * modes. Protect access to registers by acquiring the modeset
     * lock.
     ```
  2. **No Functional Changes**: The actual code remains unchanged - the mutex_lock/unlock operations and all functional code are identical. Only the comment text was modified.
  3. **No Security Impact**: Since this is purely a documentation update with no behavioral changes, there is no security vulnerability being fixed. The original commit (1fe182154984) that added the locking mechanism was the actual fix for a potential race condition.
  4. **Comment Accuracy**: The change simply corrects the comment to accurately describe when the lock is released (at the end of atomic_commit_tail, not in atomic_flush) and updates terminology (from "I/O-register lock" to "modeset lock").
  This is a documentation maintenance commit that improves code clarity but fixes no security issues.
74f46a0524f8d scsi: fnic: Turn off FDMI ACTIVE flags on link down
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a definitive answer:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's the explanation:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that FDMI (Fabric-Device Management Interface) requests stop being sent after a link down/up cycle. This is a functional defect, not a security issue.
  2. **Code changes analysis**:
     - The fix adds a single line: `iport->flags &= ~FNIC_FDMI_ACTIVE;` in the link down handler
     - This clears the FNIC_FDMI_ACTIVE flag when the link goes down
     - The flag is checked in `fnic_fdls_start_plogi()` to determine whether to initiate FDMI operations when the link comes back up
  3. **Impact**: Without this fix, FDMI functionality stops working after a link flap. FDMI is used for fabric management - it allows the HBA to register its attributes with the fabric's management service. The lack of FDMI registration doesn't create any security vulnerabilities; it merely prevents the fabric from having information about the HBA's capabilities.
  4. **No security implications**: 
     - No memory corruption
     - No privilege escalation 
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service beyond the intended functionality not working
     - No access control bypass
  This is similar to the "Similar Commit 1" example (clearing RGMII_LINK bit on link down) which was marked as "CVE Status: NO" - both are housekeeping operations that ensure proper state management during link transitions.
a35b29bdedb4d scsi: fnic: Fix crash in fnic_wq_cmpl_handler when FDMI times out
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a critical security vulnerability that can lead to a kernel crash due to a double-free memory corruption issue. Here's why this warrants a CVE:
  1. **Memory Safety Vulnerability**: The original code reused the same frame buffer when sending ABTS (Abort Sequence) messages for both RHBA and RPA FDMI requests. When these completions occurred, `fnic_wq_complete_frame_send()` would call `mempool_free(buf->os_buf, fnic->frame_pool)` twice on the same buffer, causing a double-free condition.
  2. **Crash/DoS Impact**: As stated in the commit message, this causes a crash in `fnic_wq_cmpl_handler` when FDMI times out. The double-free leads to memory corruption that crashes the kernel, resulting in a denial of service.
  3. **Triggerable Condition**: The vulnerability can be triggered when both RHBA and RPA FDMI requests time out, which is a condition that could potentially be induced by an attacker with access to the fabric network or by network conditions.
  4. **Fix Pattern**: The fix allocates separate frames for each ABTS request (`fdls_alloc_init_fdmi_abts_frame()` is called separately for PLOGI, RHBA, and RPA), preventing the double-free condition. This is a classic memory safety fix pattern.
  The vulnerability allows a crash that affects system availability through improper memory management, which qualifies as a security issue warranting CVE assignment.
2e083cd802294 scsi: ufs: core: Fix clk scaling to be conditional in reset and restore
- [sasha] Based on the analysis, I can now determine whether this commit should be assigned a CVE:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a performance/power management bug, not a security vulnerability. The commit fixes an incorrect CPU latency QoS (Quality of Service) vote that happens during resume when clock scaling is not supported.
  2. **Performance/Power Issue Only**: The bug causes `ufshcd_pm_qos_update(hba, true)` to be called (via `ufshcd_scale_clks`) even when clock scaling is not supported. This results in CPU latency being voted to 0 during resume, which is a power/performance optimization issue, not a security concern.
  3. **No Exploitable Impact**: The code change simply adds a check `if (ufshcd_is_clkscaling_supported(hba))` before calling `ufshcd_scale_clks()`. This prevents unnecessary PM QoS updates on systems that don't support clock scaling. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant impact.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: The referenced similar commits (1-5) are all marked as "CVE Status: NO" and they deal with similar UFS driver optimizations, clock gating, and performance improvements - none of which are security issues.
  The fix is a proper bug fix for a power management issue but does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
752eb816b55ad scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix invalid node index
- [sasha] Now let me analyze if this is a security vulnerability:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Array index out-of-bounds access**: The bug allows passing index -1 to the `node_to_cpumask_map[]` array in `cpumask_of_node()`, which causes an out-of-bounds memory access. The UBSAN report clearly shows "index -1 is out of range for type 'cpumask *[1024]'".
  2. **Memory safety violation**: This is a classic memory safety issue where invalid array indexing can lead to reading from arbitrary memory locations before the array base. In the kernel context, this could potentially:
     - Access sensitive kernel data structures
     - Cause kernel crashes/DoS
     - In worst case scenarios, potentially be exploited for information disclosure
  3. **Triggerable condition**: The bug triggers on systems with DRAM interleave enabled where `dev_to_node()` returns NUMA_NO_NODE (-1). This is a real hardware configuration that exists in production systems.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, all of them involve array-index-out-of-bounds issues and were assigned CVEs. This commit follows the same pattern - fixing an out-of-bounds array access in kernel code.
  5. **Fix validates the security impact**: The fix adds a bounds check (`if (nid == NUMA_NO_NODE) nid = 0;`) specifically to prevent the negative array index, confirming this was a real security issue.
  The security impact is primarily a denial of service (kernel crash) and potential information disclosure through out-of-bounds memory read.
85a720f4337f0 HID: wacom: fix kobject reference count leak
- [sasha] **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a kobject reference count leak that occurs when `sysfs_create_files()` fails in the `wacom_initialize_remotes()` function. The bug pattern is identical to the similar commits that received CVEs:
  1. **Resource Leak Pattern**: `kobject_create_and_add()` creates a kobject with refcount=1, but the error path after `sysfs_create_files()` failure was missing the required `kobject_put()` call, causing a memory leak.
  2. **Matches CVE Precedent**: All 5 similar commits with "CVE Status: YES" fix the exact same type of vulnerability - missing `kobject_put()` calls in error paths after `kobject_init_and_add()` or `kobject_create_and_add()`.
  3. **Security Impact**: While exploitation requires triggering initialization failures (possibly through memory pressure or filesystem issues), repeated failures can lead to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service.
  The fix correctly adds `kobject_put(remote->remote_dir)` to the error path, ensuring proper cleanup of the kobject reference.
1a19ae437ca5d HID: wacom: fix memory leak on sysfs attribute creation failure
- [sasha] So there are TWO separate commits! The commit I'm analyzing only fixes the kfifo memory leak, not the kobject leak. Let me re-analyze based on this understanding.
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel source code:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This commit only fixes a memory leak of the kfifo buffer when `sysfs_create_files()` fails during device initialization. It's a simple resource cleanup issue in an error path.
  2. **Limited attack surface**: 
     - The leak only occurs during device initialization when `sysfs_create_files()` fails
     - This requires either physical access to plug/unplug a Wacom device or elevated privileges to trigger device re-initialization
     - The failure of `sysfs_create_files()` is rare and typically only happens under extreme conditions (out of memory, filesystem issues)
  3. **Low security impact**:
     - Each leak is small (5 * sizeof(struct wacom_remote_work_data))
     - An attacker would need to repeatedly trigger device initialization failures
     - No direct path for unprivileged remote exploitation
  4. **Comparison with similar CVE-assigned commits**:
     - The similar commits with CVE status show more significant memory leaks in probe/initialization paths that could be triggered more easily
     - They often involve larger memory allocations or more accessible attack vectors
     - This fix is for a narrow edge case in specialized hardware (Wacom tablets)
  5. **Separate kobject leak**: There's a separate commit (85a720f4337f) that fixes the kobject reference leak in the same error path. That commit has more security relevance as kobject leaks are more significant, but this specific commit only addresses the kfifo leak.
  The memory leak fixed here is a quality issue rather than a security vulnerability with meaningful exploitability.
5ae416c5b1e2e HID: wacom: fix memory leak on kobject creation failure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a memory leak that occurs only during device initialization failure, specifically when `kobject_create_and_add()` fails. The leaked memory is from `kfifo_alloc()` which allocates a small fifo buffer (5 * sizeof(struct wacom_remote_work_data)).
  2. **Trigger conditions**: The memory leak only happens when:
     - A Wacom device with REMOTE type is being initialized
     - The `kobject_create_and_add()` call fails (which typically happens only under extreme memory pressure or other system failures)
     - This is during device probe/initialization, not during normal operation
  3. **Security impact**: 
     - No privilege escalation potential
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service under normal conditions
     - The leak is bounded to device initialization failures only
     - Cannot be triggered remotely
     - Requires physical device attachment/detachment to trigger
  4. **Comparison with similar commits marked as CVEs**: The similar commits shown (like the vmbus, dmi-sysfs, ab8500, wfx, and ALSA fixes) also fix kobject-related memory leaks, but they were assigned CVEs. However, those could potentially be triggered more frequently during normal operation or had different security contexts.
  5. **Limited exploitability**: An attacker would need physical access to repeatedly attach/detach Wacom devices AND cause kobject creation to fail (difficult to control), making this impractical for exploitation.
  This is a quality/correctness fix rather than a security vulnerability. The memory leak is small, occurs only in error paths during device initialization, and has no practical security implications.
9327e3ee5b077 HID: lenovo: Restrict F7/9/11 mode to compact keyboards only
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional regression, not a security issue. The commit fixes a problem where non-compact keyboards (specifically ThinkPad TrackPoint Keyboard II) lost the ability to toggle Fn-lock via the Fn+Esc key combination.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue only affects keyboard functionality - specifically the ability to toggle Fn-lock using a keyboard shortcut. Users can still control this feature through sysfs, so it's not a complete loss of functionality.
  3. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The regression doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data disclosure, or any other security-relevant behavior.
  4. **Limited scope**: The issue only affects specific Lenovo keyboard models (TrackPoint Keyboard II) and only impacts one convenience feature (Fn+Esc shortcut for toggling Fn-lock).
  5. **Code changes are benign**: The fix simply restores a conditional check that ensures the F7/9/11 mode command (0x01, 0x03) is only sent to compact keyboards (CUSBKBD and CBTKBD models), not to all keyboards handled by the driver.
  The regression was introduced when code was refactored to support reset_resume functionality, and the device-specific conditional was accidentally removed. This is a typical functional regression that happens during code refactoring, not a security vulnerability.
4540e41e753a7 HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a reference counting leak where `backlight_device_get_by_name()` increments the device reference count but the code never calls `put_device()` to decrement it. This is a resource leak, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Security impact**: The reference leak prevents the backlight device from being properly freed when the module is unloaded or the device is removed. This can lead to:
     - Memory leak (the device structure remains allocated)
     - Inability to properly unload the backlight driver module
     - Resource exhaustion only after many load/unload cycles
  3. **Exploitation requirements**: To exploit this, an attacker would need:
     - Ability to load/unload kernel modules (requires root privileges)
     - Ability to repeatedly attach/detach the HID device
     - The attack would only cause resource exhaustion after many iterations
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - "auxdisplay: ht16k33: Drop reference after LED registration" - NO CVE
     - "USB: appledisplay: close race between probe and completion handler" - NO CVE (despite being a race condition)
     - "pinctrl: devicetree: fix refcount leak in pinctrl_dt_to_map()" - YES CVE
     - "Revert 'leds: led-core: Fix refcount leak in of_led_get()'" - NO CVE
     - "soc: bcm: brcmstb: pm: pm-arm: Fix refcount leak in brcmstb_pm_probe" - YES CVE
  5. **Key differences from CVE-worthy reference leaks**: The commits that received CVEs typically involved:
     - Core kernel subsystems (pinctrl, SoC power management)
     - Potential for unprivileged triggering
     - More severe consequences beyond simple resource leaks
  This HID driver reference leak is a bug that should be fixed (and was), but it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
ba8dac350faf1 f2fs: fix to zero post-eof page
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes a data leak vulnerability where uninitialized or stale data from memory pages can be exposed to unprivileged users. Here's why this is a security issue:
  1. **Information Disclosure**: The bug allows reading "dummy data" (stale/uninitialized memory content) from post-EOF pages that should contain zeros. The test output shows non-zero values (0x2a25, 0x2527) where zeros are expected.
  2. **Attack Vector**: An unprivileged user can trigger this through normal filesystem operations:
     - Use mmap() to write data beyond EOF
     - Perform operations that expand the file size (write, truncate, fallocate)
     - Read the expanded area and potentially obtain sensitive data from uninitialized memory
  3. **Security Impact**: The exposed data could contain:
     - Contents from previously deleted files
     - Data from other users' files
     - Kernel memory contents
     - Any sensitive information that was previously in those memory pages
  4. **Wide Scope**: The fix is needed across multiple file operations (write, truncate, fallocate variants), indicating this is a systemic issue affecting various code paths.
  5. **Stable Backport**: The commit includes "Cc: stable@kernel.org", indicating the maintainers recognize this needs to be fixed in stable kernels.
  This is similar to other CVE-worthy filesystem bugs that expose uninitialized data, such as the historical ext4 issues with uninitialized extents. The pattern of "READ BAD DATA" with non-zero values where zeros are expected is a classic sign of information disclosure vulnerabilities in filesystems.
517f496e1e61b mm/gup: revert "mm: gup: fix infinite loop within __get_longterm_locked"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context, here is my determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes and commit message:
  1. **Security Vulnerability Introduced**: The commit message explicitly states that after commit 1aaf8c122918, "we are able to longterm pin folios that are not supposed to get longterm pinned." This is a clear security vulnerability that violates memory management constraints.
  2. **Memory Isolation Bypass**: The vulnerability allows bypassing memory isolation mechanisms. Folios that are temporarily isolated (with LRU flag cleared) can be incorrectly longterm pinned when they shouldn't be. This affects CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator) and ZONE_MOVABLE memory areas which have specific security and reliability constraints.
  3. **Race Condition Exploitation**: The commit describes race conditions where "two __get_longterm_locked() callers can race, or __get_longterm_locked() can race with anything else that temporarily isolates folios." This creates exploitable race conditions.
  4. **Critical Memory Management Issue**: The code changes show that the original fix changed the logic from checking `collected` count to checking `list_empty()`. The problem is that `collected` tracks all unpinnable folios found, while the list only contains those that could be successfully isolated. Folios with LRU flag cleared won't be added to the list but were still counted in `collected`, creating the security issue.
  5. **System Integrity Impact**: Allowing longterm pinning of memory that shouldn't be pinned can lead to:
     - Memory fragmentation issues
     - Inability to migrate memory when needed
     - Potential system instability
     - Bypass of intended memory management policies
  The vulnerability allows improper memory pinning which is a fundamental security issue in kernel memory management, warranting CVE assignment.
a05dd8ae5cbb1 mm/shmem, swap: fix softlockup with mTHP swapin
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit in question:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Denial of Service (DoS) via Soft Lockup**: The commit fixes a soft lockup that can cause the system to become unresponsive for extended periods (763+ seconds as shown in the commit message). This is a clear availability issue that can be triggered by userspace operations.
  2. **Easy Reproducibility**: The commit message provides a simple reproducer that shows how unprivileged users can trigger this DoS condition through normal file operations (dd and cat commands) within a memory cgroup.
  3. **Security Impact**: The soft lockup prevents the CPU from responding to other tasks, effectively creating a DoS condition. The watchdog messages show "CPU#0 stuck for 763s!" which indicates severe system unresponsiveness.
  4. **Root Cause**: The issue occurs when shmem_swap_alloc_folio returns -EEXIST due to conflicts between order-0 folios in swap cache and larger mTHP folios being allocated. This causes an infinite retry loop without any scheduling points, leading to the soft lockup.
  5. **Similar CVE Precedents**: The referenced similar commits show that soft lockup fixes in memory management have been assigned CVEs:
     - "mm/swapfile: add cond_resched() in get_swap_pages()" - CVE assigned
     - "memcg: fix soft lockup in the OOM process" - CVE assigned
     - "mm: vmscan: remove deadlock due to throttling failing to make progress" - CVE assigned
  6. **Affected Component**: The issue affects core memory management subsystem (shmem and swap), which is a critical kernel component that impacts system stability.
  The fix adds a check using `non_swapcache_batch()` to detect conflicts and prevent the infinite retry loop, similar to how anonymous memory mTHP swapin handles this scenario.
0ea148a799198 mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I conclude:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes and commit analysis:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes a race condition in the `userfaultfd_move` operation that can lead to:
     - RSS counter corruption (memory accounting errors)
     - Potential kernel BUG_ON triggers (as seen in the related commit c50f8e6053b0)
     - Moving the wrong folio (page) to a different VMA, which could result in incorrect memory mappings
  2. **Root Cause**: The vulnerability exists because `move_swap_pte()` performs a lockless swap cache lookup and relies on PTE value checks that are unreliable. This allows a race where:
     - A swap entry can be freed and reused by a different folio between the initial lookup and the actual move operation
     - The wrong folio can be moved to the destination VMA
  3. **Exploitability**: While the commit mentions "the race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple rare events," it also states that "with a deliberately constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced easily."
  4. **Code Changes**: The fix adds critical security checks:
     - Validates that the folio still belongs to the target swap entry after acquiring locks (lines 1095-1097)
     - Adds an additional check for newly loaded swap cache entries (lines 1130-1133)
  5. **Similar CVE Precedents**: The related commits that this builds upon (c50f8e6053b0) fix similar race conditions with kernel BUG_ON triggers and memory corruption issues, which are typically CVE-worthy.
  6. **Stable Backport**: The commit is marked with `Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>`, indicating it's a serious issue that needs to be backported to stable kernels.
  The vulnerability allows potential memory corruption through incorrect page/folio mapping between VMAs, which is a clear security issue that warrants CVE assignment.
fba46a5d83ca8 maple_tree: fix MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag in mas_preallocate()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The commit explicitly states that the flaw causes "a WARN_ON() followed by a null pointer dereference" which can crash the kernel. The issue occurs when the MA_STATE_PREALLOC flag prevents mas_alloc_nodes() from allocating additional requested nodes (lines 1242-1246 show it returns early if the flag is set and there are existing allocations). This leads to subsequent code attempting to use nodes that were never allocated, resulting in a null pointer dereference.
  The security impact is a denial of service vulnerability through kernel crashes. The commit is marked for stable backports and affects the maple tree since its introduction. Similar null pointer dereference fixes in the maple tree code (like Similar Commits 1, 3, and 5) have received CVE assignments, establishing a clear precedent.
85720e04d9af0 net: libwx: fix the creation of page_pool
- [sasha] Let me analyze what's happening:
  1. `rx_ring->size` = count * sizeof(descriptor) and then ALIGN to 4K
  2. `rx_ring->count` = number of descriptors
  The issue is that when `pool_size` is set to `rx_ring->size` (which is count * descriptor_size), it can become very large. For example:
  - If count = 8192 descriptors 
  - Descriptor size = 32 bytes
  - size = 8192 * 32 = 262,144 bytes
  - After 4K alignment, this could be even larger
  The page pool's `pool_size` parameter appears to expect the number of pages/entries, not the total byte size. Setting it to the byte size would create an excessively large pool, causing the E2BIG error.
  **CVE Analysis Decision:**
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE because:
  1. **No security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug where incorrect parameter usage causes page pool creation to fail with E2BIG error. There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service vulnerability.
  2. **Fail-safe behavior**: The error is handled gracefully - when page_pool_create() fails, it returns an error which prevents the driver from initializing incorrectly. The system logs the error and fails safely rather than operating in an insecure state.
  3. **Configuration/resource allocation issue**: The bug is about passing wrong size units (bytes instead of count) to pool_size parameter. This is similar to the first similar commit example which fixed descriptor count alignment issues - that was also marked as NO CVE.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: An attacker cannot leverage this bug to compromise the system. It simply prevents the network driver from initializing properly when ring sizes are large enough to trigger the limit.
  The fix correctly changes `pool_size` from `rx_ring->size` (total bytes) to `rx_ring->count` (number of descriptors), which is what the page pool API expects.
b07f349d1864a spi: spi-cadence-quadspi: Fix pm runtime unbalance
- [sasha] Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Let me provide my final analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a runtime PM reference counting bug that causes incorrect state tracking but has no security implications:
     - The underflow just prints a warning message and returns -EINVAL
     - No memory corruption, privilege escalation, or system compromise
     - No denial of service - the system continues to function
  2. **Limited impact**: 
     - Only affects device unbind/rebind operations
     - Requires physical access or root privileges to trigger (unbinding devices)
     - The worst outcome is error messages and inability to properly manage device power states
  3. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed pm_runtime_set_suspended() ordering - similar PM state management issue
     - Commit 5 (NO CVE): Fixed pm_runtime_force_* calls - another PM state tracking bug
  4. **Key difference from CVE-worthy commits**:
     - CVE commits 2, 3, 4 involved deadlocks, mutex issues, or pointer corruption
     - This commit just fixes reference counting that leads to benign error messages
  The code changes show it's fixing a resource management bug where:
  - `devm_pm_runtime_enable()` was replaced with manual `pm_runtime_enable()`
  - Added missing `pm_runtime_get_sync()` before clock operations in remove
  - Added proper `pm_runtime_disable()` in error paths
  This is a quality/correctness fix, not a security fix.
fde46f60f6c51 selinux: change security_compute_sid to return the ssid or tsid on match
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. While the commit addresses a problem where multiple initial SIDs that map to the same security context could cause `sidtab_context_to_sid()` to return a different SID than expected, this doesn't create a security vulnerability because:
  1. The security contexts are identical regardless of which SID is returned, meaning the actual SELinux permissions and access control decisions would be the same
  2. The fix ensures consistency by returning the original ssid or tsid when the computed context matches, but this is about maintaining expected behavior rather than preventing a security breach
  3. There's no privilege escalation or access control bypass possible since the contexts (and thus the security permissions) remain unchanged
  The issue is more about SELinux internal consistency and avoiding unexpected SID assignments when multiple initial SIDs share the same context, which is a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
48fd7ebe00c1c Revert "bcache: remove heap-related macros and switch to generic min_heap"
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether the performance regression constitutes a security vulnerability worthy of a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit reverts a performance regression in bcache, not a security vulnerability. The key evidence:
  1. **Performance issue, not security**: The commit explicitly describes this as fixing performance degradation where P100 latency increased from 600ms to 2.4 seconds. While this causes timeouts and application stalls, it's an availability/performance issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  2. **No memory safety issues**: The code changes show reverting from generic min_heap implementation back to bcache's original heap macros. Unlike similar commits that received CVEs (which fixed out-of-bounds access, buffer overflows, or memory corruption), this change only affects algorithmic efficiency.
  3. **Algorithm choice problem**: The issue stems from the bottom-up heap implementation performing O(2*log2(n)) comparisons versus O(1) for the original top-down approach when many equal values exist. This is purely an algorithmic performance characteristic.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication that an attacker could leverage this performance degradation to compromise the system beyond causing slowdowns. The timeouts and stalls are side effects of poor performance, not security vulnerabilities.
  Comparing to the similar commits provided, those assigned CVEs involved memory corruption bugs (out-of-bounds access, cache corruption, oversized reads causing kernel panics). This commit only addresses performance regression without any memory safety or security implications.
845f1f2d69f3f Revert "bcache: update min_heap_callbacks to use default builtin swap"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Performance regression, not security vulnerability**: The commit explicitly states it's reverting changes that caused "severe performance regression" - latency spikes increasing from 600ms to 2.4 seconds. While performance issues can be severe, they are not security vulnerabilities unless they enable denial-of-service attacks.
  2. **Code optimization rollback**: The changes are restoring custom swap functions that were previously removed. The original change (being reverted) replaced custom swap implementations with NULL to use default builtin swap - this was a code optimization attempt that didn't work well performance-wise.
  3. **No security implications in the code**: The code changes show adding back `new_bucket_swap` and `new_btree_iter_swap` functions that simply swap elements. These are pure performance-related functions with no security boundary crossings, privilege escalations, or data exposure risks.
  4. **Functional equivalence**: The revert restores the previous implementation which had better performance characteristics but is functionally equivalent from a security perspective. Both approaches (custom swap vs builtin swap) achieve the same result, just with different performance profiles.
  5. **Production impact is operational, not security**: While the commit mentions "timeouts and application stalls in production environments," these are availability/reliability issues rather than exploitable security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is marked for stable backporting (`Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>`) because it fixes a significant performance regression that affects production systems, not because it addresses a security vulnerability.
2dcf838cf5c2f btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  This commit fixes a **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability** that can lead to a kernel crash. The issue is specifically:
  1. **The vulnerability**: When `read_one_inode()` returns NULL (indicating an error), the code incorrectly attempts to dereference this NULL pointer by calling `iput(&inode->vfs_inode)`. This causes an invalid memory access and kernel crash.
  2. **Security impact**: This is a denial-of-service vulnerability that can crash the kernel during BTRFS log replay operations. The crash occurs in multiple code paths:
     - In `drop_one_dir_item()` at line 962
     - In `__add_inode_ref()` around line 1179
     - In `replay_one_extent()` around line 672
  3. **Pattern matches CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, all of them fix NULL pointer dereferences in BTRFS and were assigned CVEs. This commit follows the exact same pattern - fixing NULL pointer dereferences that lead to kernel crashes.
  4. **Trigger conditions**: The vulnerability can be triggered during BTRFS log replay when certain error conditions occur (corrupted filesystem, I/O errors, etc.) that cause `read_one_inode()` to return NULL.
  The code changes show clear fixes where NULL checks are added before dereferencing:
  - `if (inode) iput(&inode->vfs_inode);` instead of unconditional `iput(&inode->vfs_inode);`
  - Early returns instead of falling through to error paths that dereference NULL pointers
  This vulnerability has clear security implications as it allows potential system crashes, making it appropriate for CVE assignment.
ae4477f937569 btrfs: update superblock's device bytes_used when dropping chunk
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now make my determination.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is an accounting inconsistency issue where the superblock's copy of the device bytes_used value was not being updated during chunk removal operations. The commit message clearly states this is about correctly updating metadata values.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes show this is purely about ensuring proper metadata accounting. When a chunk is dropped, the device's bytes_used counter needs to be updated in the superblock. The fix adds the device to the post_commit_list to ensure btrfs_commit_device_sizes() is called during transaction commit.
  3. **Detection method**: The issue is detectable by btrfs-check (a filesystem consistency checker), which indicates this is a filesystem consistency/correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  4. **No exploitation vector**: There's no evidence in the code or commit message that this bug could be exploited to:
     - Gain unauthorized access
     - Cause denial of service
     - Corrupt data in a way that benefits an attacker
     - Bypass security boundaries
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, commit 1 (replacing sb::s_blocksize) and commit 5 (fixing reclaimed bytes accounting) were both marked as non-CVE, and they deal with similar metadata/accounting issues.
  The fix is simply ensuring that when chunks are removed and device space is freed, the superblock's metadata is properly updated to reflect the change - a bookkeeping correction rather than a security fix.
3ca864de852bc btrfs: fix a race between renames and directory logging
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit systematically:
  ## Analysis
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  ### Explanation:
  1. **Data Loss Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a race condition that leads to **file deletion/data loss**. As stated in the commit message: "the log replay code will end up deleting the file that was being renamed." This is a serious security issue with data integrity implications.
  2. **Race Condition Security Issue**: The vulnerability is a classic Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition between rename operations and directory logging. The detailed step-by-step analysis in the commit message shows how the race window allows a file to be permanently lost after a power failure.
  3. **Exploitable Window**: The vulnerability creates a window where:
     - Task A removes the old directory entry during rename but hasn't added the new entry yet
     - Task B logs the directory in this intermediate state
     - A power failure results in the log replay deleting the file entirely
  4. **Similar to CVE-assigned Commits**: This commit shares characteristics with the provided similar commits that received CVEs:
     - Like "btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is synced" (CVE assigned), it deals with filesystem consistency issues during rename operations
     - Like "btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref" (CVE assigned), it fixes corruption during rename operations
  5. **Fix Implementation**: The fix pins the log root before removing the old directory entry and unpins it after `btrfs_log_new_name()` is called, preventing the race condition. This is a critical timing fix for a data loss scenario.
  6. **Stable Backport**: The commit is marked for stable backport (`CC: stable@vger.kernel.org # 5.18+`), indicating it's a serious issue affecting multiple kernel versions.
  The vulnerability allows unintended data loss through a race condition, which is a security-relevant issue warranting CVE assignment.
95b2e31e17524 bcache: remove unnecessary select MIN_HEAP
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is purely a Kconfig cleanup that removes an unnecessary `select MIN_HEAP` dependency. The actual code reverting the min heap usage was done in a previous commit (48fd7ebe00c1). This commit only removes the now-unused Kconfig dependency.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The commit addresses a performance regression (latency spikes from 600ms to 2.4 seconds), not a security vulnerability. Performance regressions, while impactful to production systems, do not constitute security vulnerabilities requiring CVE assignment.
  3. **No exploitable condition**: There is no exploitable security condition here. The issue is that the generic min heap implementation performed worse than bcache's original custom implementation in certain hot paths, causing latency spikes. This is a quality-of-service issue, not a security issue.
  4. **Type of fix**: This is a cleanup/optimization that removes an unused dependency after the actual performance fix was applied. It's part of a series that reverts bcache back to its original heap implementation to restore performance.
  5. **Attack surface claim is misleading**: While the commit message mentions "shrink the kernel's attack surface", this is a generic benefit of removing unused code/dependencies, not an indication that there was an actual security vulnerability.
  The commit is properly fixing a real performance issue that impacts production systems, which is why it's marked for stable backporting, but performance regressions alone do not warrant CVE assignment unless they enable denial-of-service attacks or other security vulnerabilities.
db53805156f1e dm-raid: fix variable in journal device check
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. In the function `super_init_validation()`:
  - The function parameter is `struct md_rdev *rdev` (line 2238)
  - The local variable for iteration is `struct md_rdev *r` (line 2246)
  The bug is that on line 2410 (in the diff), the code was incorrectly using `rdev` (the function parameter) instead of `r` (the loop iterator variable) when checking if the Journal flag is set.
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This bug is a simple variable name error that does not create any security vulnerability:
  1. **No security impact**: The incorrect variable check `test_bit(Journal, &rdev->flags)` would check the journal flag on the function parameter `rdev` instead of the loop iterator `r`. This is a logic error but does not lead to any exploitable condition.
  2. **Limited scope**: The bug only affects the logic that determines which devices should have their `failed_devices` and `extended_failed_devices` fields cleared. Using the wrong variable would cause the journal check to be performed on the same device repeatedly instead of on each device in the loop.
  3. **No memory safety issues**: There are no buffer overflows, out-of-bounds accesses, or other memory corruption issues. The `rdev` parameter is valid throughout the function.
  4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The bug doesn't allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  5. **Functional bug only**: This is a pure functional bug that could cause incorrect behavior in RAID journal device handling but poses no security risk.
  The similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" involved actual security vulnerabilities like out-of-bounds array accesses that could lead to memory corruption. This commit merely fixes a variable name mistake with no security implications.
042bb9603c446 Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix L2CAP MTU negotiation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can see that:
  1. The commit changes MTU negotiation behavior to use a previously negotiated MTU value instead of always defaulting to 672 bytes
  2. The code has proper validation checks that ensure:
     - MTU values are checked against L2CAP_DEFAULT_MIN_MTU (48 bytes) 
     - Outgoing data is checked against chan->omtu before sending (lines 2570, 2600, 2617)
     - Buffer allocation is limited by conn->mtu, not chan->omtu (line 2284)
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a performance/functionality fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The change allows for better MTU negotiation by using previously negotiated values instead of always falling back to the default 672 bytes. All security checks remain in place:
  1. The MTU value is still validated against the minimum MTU (48 bytes)
  2. Outgoing packets are still checked against the negotiated MTU
  3. Buffer allocation is still properly bounded by the connection MTU
  4. There's no memory corruption, buffer overflow, or other security-sensitive issue being fixed
  The commit simply improves interoperability with devices (like iPhones) that expect both directions to use negotiated MTU values, rather than falling back to defaults when MTU is not explicitly specified in every configuration request.
f23c52aafb167 serial: imx: Restore original RXTL for console to fix data loss
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The bug causes data loss in console operations (when pasting text into vi), but this is a functional reliability issue, not a security vulnerability. The data loss occurs during normal user interaction with the console, not due to any privilege escalation or unauthorized access.
  2. **Console-Only Impact**: The fix specifically targets console usage (`uart_console(&sport->port)`), restoring RXTL to 1 only for console operations while keeping the optimized value of 8 for non-console UART usage. This indicates a usability/reliability issue rather than a security concern.
  3. **No Exploitable Attack Vector**: The issue manifests as missing characters or lines when pasting text into console applications like vi. This is a quality/reliability bug that affects data integrity during normal operations, but there's no indication that it can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service.
  4. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show various UART fixes for timing issues, configuration problems, and data handling improvements - none of which were assigned CVEs despite fixing functional issues.
  5. **Nature of the Fix**: The fix simply adjusts the RX trigger level (RXTL) from 8 back to 1 for console operations to ensure timely interrupts. This is a performance/reliability trade-off adjustment, not a security hardening measure.
  The commit fixes a legitimate bug that causes data corruption during console input, but data corruption in this context is a functional issue affecting user experience, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
d36f0e9a0002f serial: core: restore of_node information in sysfs
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional regression where the of_node symlink was missing from sysfs after a device hierarchy restructuring. The change simply adds `device_set_of_node_from_dev(dev, parent_dev);` to propagate existing device tree information from parent to child devices. This restores previously available information that udev rules depend on, rather than fixing any security vulnerability. There's no privilege escalation, memory safety issue, or information disclosure - it's purely restoring expected functionality that was inadvertently broken.
09812134071b3 dt-bindings: serial: 8250: Make clocks and clock-frequency exclusive
- [sasha] Now I understand the behavior. Let me analyze this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a device tree binding schema change that switches from `anyOf` to `oneOf` for clock-related properties. It's a specification/validation change, not a code vulnerability.
  2. **Documentation/schema fix only**: The change is purely in the YAML schema file (`Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/8250.yaml`). It doesn't modify any executable code that could introduce security issues.
  3. **Prevents configuration issues**: The commit actually improves the situation by preventing potentially problematic configurations where both `clocks` and `clock-frequency` properties coexist, which could lead to confusion but not security vulnerabilities.
  4. **Driver behavior unchanged**: The commit message mentions the driver's existing behavior (ignoring `clocks` when both are present), but this commit doesn't change that behavior - it only updates the schema to properly validate device tree files.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO", they are also device tree binding changes (converting to YAML, adding clock properties, fixing duplicated bindings) that don't introduce security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is fixing a schema validation issue where `anyOf` incorrectly allowed both properties to coexist when the original intent was to have them be mutually exclusive. This is a correctness fix in documentation/validation, not a security fix.
a55bc4ffc06d8 staging: rtl8723bs: Avoid memset() in aes_cipher() and aes_decipher()
- [sasha] Prompt is too long
5f465c148c61e x86/traps: Initialize DR6 by writing its architectural reset value
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The issue being fixed is a false positive warning, not an actual security vulnerability. The commit message states it "leads to a false bus lock detected warning" - meaning the system incorrectly reports bus locks that didn't actually happen.
  2. **No Exploitable Impact**: The code changes show this is about properly initializing the DR6 debug register to its architectural reset value (0xFFFF0FF0) instead of zeroing it. This prevents false warnings but doesn't fix any security boundary violations, privilege escalations, or other exploitable conditions.
  3. **Initialization/Warning Issue Only**: The problem occurs at boot time when DR6 is incorrectly initialized to 0 instead of its proper reset value. This causes DR6.BLD (bit 11) to be 0, which in the bus lock detection logic is interpreted as a bus lock having occurred (since DR6.BLD is an active-low bit).
  4. **No Data Corruption or System Compromise**: The changes only affect debug register initialization and the naming of functions (`clear_all_debug_regs` → `initialize_debug_regs`, `debug_read_clear_dr6` → `debug_read_reset_dr6`). There's no memory corruption, information disclosure, or other security-relevant impact.
  5. **Similar to Non-CVE Examples**: This is similar to the non-CVE examples provided, particularly the mutex initialization fix, which also addressed incorrect initialization leading to warnings but without security implications.
  The commit is a correctness fix that ensures the debug registers are properly initialized according to Intel's architectural specification, preventing spurious warnings about bus locks that haven't actually occurred.
a3f3040657417 EDAC/amd64: Fix size calculation for Non-Power-of-Two DIMMs
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The commit fixes an incorrect calculation of DIMM sizes for non-power-of-two DIMMs (48GB, 96GB, etc.) in the EDAC (Error Detection And Correction) subsystem. The bug only affected size reporting/display, not actual memory access or protection mechanisms.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: Unlike the bluefield CVE (integer overflow causing data truncation in SMC calls), this bug only affects:
     - Incorrect size reporting in sysfs (`/sys/devices/system/edac/`)
     - Debug output messages
     - Internal EDAC bookkeeping
  3. **No exploitable consequences**: The code changes show this only affects:
     - `edac_dbg()` debug output
     - `amd64_info()` informational messages  
     - `dimm->nr_pages` calculation used for display purposes
     
     There's no evidence this affects:
     - Memory access controls
     - Error detection/correction functionality
     - System stability or crashes
     - Privilege boundaries
  4. **Limited impact**: The bug only manifests on specific hardware (AMD Zen systems with non-power-of-two DIMMs), and the consequence is merely incorrect size reporting to userspace monitoring tools.
  5. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commits**: The bluefield commit that received a CVE involved an actual integer overflow in SMC (Secure Monitor Call) arguments, which could potentially affect secure firmware communication. This commit, by contrast, is purely a calculation error in size reporting with no security implications.
  The fix is important for correctness and has been marked for stable backports, but it does not meet the threshold for CVE assignment as it poses no security risk.
711741f94ac3c smb: client: fix potential deadlock when reconnecting channels
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The code changes fix a circular locking dependency that causes a deadlock in the SMB/CIFS client code. The deadlock occurs in `cifs_signal_cifsd_for_reconnect()` due to improper lock ordering:
  The problematic lock ordering was:
  - `cifs_tcp_ses_lock` → `ses->chan_lock` → `server->srv_lock`
  This created a circular dependency with other code paths that take locks in different orders, as shown in the lockdep trace. The fix restructures the code to avoid taking `srv_lock` while holding `chan_lock` by using a temporary list to collect servers that need reconnection.
  This deadlock can be triggered during SMB channel reconnection scenarios, which could occur due to network disruptions or potentially be forced by an attacker. When triggered, it would cause the cifsd thread to hang, making SMB mounts unusable and creating a denial of service condition.
  All five similar commits provided as references that fix deadlocks in SMB/CIFS code were assigned CVEs, and this commit exhibits the same security-relevant characteristics.
af2b588abe006 drm/xe: Process deferred GGTT node removals on device unwind
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the crash and the fix:
  ## Analysis Summary:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  This commit fixes a **resource cleanup ordering issue** during device removal/unwind, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the Bug**: The issue is a use-after-free of MMIO mappings during device teardown. The GGTT workqueue (ggtt->wq) processes deferred node removals that attempt to write to MMIO memory (via `xe_ggtt_set_pte()` which writes to `ggtt->gsm`). However, the MMIO mappings are freed by `mmio_fini` before the workqueue is drained by `ggtt_fini_early`.
  2. **Trigger Conditions**: This only occurs during:
     - Device removal/unwind (failed probe or module unload)
     - Specifically when there are pending GGTT node removals in the workqueue
     - The crash trace shows it happened during "unsuccessful VF initialization"
  3. **Impact Assessment**:
     - This is a **driver cleanup/ordering bug**, not exploitable
     - Requires physical device removal or driver unload to trigger
     - Cannot be triggered by unprivileged users
     - No information disclosure, privilege escalation, or system compromise potential
     - Results in a kernel oops during cleanup, not a security breach
  4. **Fix Analysis**: The fix simply adds a `dev_fini_ggtt` function that drains the workqueue via `devm_add_action_or_reset()`, ensuring pending work is completed before MMIO mappings are released. This is a standard resource management fix.
  5. **Comparison to Similar Commits**:
     - Similar commit 2 (CVE: YES) dealt with preventing rogue MMIO access after device removal with security implications
     - Similar commit 4 (CVE: YES) also dealt with MMIO safety but had broader security context
     - This commit is purely about fixing a driver cleanup ordering bug
  The key difference is this bug can only manifest during legitimate device teardown scenarios and has no security exploitation vector.
ad40098da5c3b drm/xe/guc: Explicitly exit CT safe mode on unwind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now make a determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a driver initialization/teardown ordering issue that causes a WARNING message, not a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states "which triggers a WARN" - this is a kernel warning, not a security issue.
  2. **Root cause**: The issue is that during early driver probe failure/abort, a delayed work item (`safe_mode_worker`) might still be pending when the workqueue is destroyed. This is a race condition in the cleanup path that results in a warning message.
  3. **Impact**: The impact is limited to a warning message in the kernel log during driver probe failure. There's no memory corruption, no privilege escalation, no information disclosure, or any other security impact.
  4. **Code analysis**: The fix simply adds a call to `ct_exit_safe_mode(ct)` in the `guc_ct_fini()` function before destroying the workqueue. This ensures the delayed work is properly canceled before cleanup.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This fix is similar in nature to the other "NO CVE" commits shown in the examples - they deal with race conditions and ordering issues in driver initialization/teardown that don't have security implications.
  The safe mode worker is a mechanism to poll for G2H (GuC to Host) messages when IRQs are not yet enabled during early initialization. The issue only manifests during probe failure scenarios, and the fix is a proper cleanup ordering issue, not a security vulnerability.
55e8ff842051b drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Add HPD for DisplayPort connector type
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functionality fix that corrects HPD (Hot Plug Detect) behavior for DisplayPort connections on the TI SN65DSI86 bridge chip. The issue was that HPD was always disabled regardless of connector type, causing the detect() function to always report connected status.
  2. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes:
     - Incorrect HPD detection that always returned "connected" status
     - Performance issues from runtime PM calls in detect()
     - Conditional HPD disable based on connector type (eDP vs DisplayPort)
  3. **No security impact**: The changes involve:
     - Conditionally disabling HPD based on connector type in `ti_sn65dsi86_enable_comms()`
     - Moving runtime PM calls to dedicated `hpd_enable()`/`hpd_disable()` functions
     - Updating HPD configuration when DisplayPort type is detected
  4. **Functional bug fix**: This addresses a display detection issue where:
     - The HPD_DEBOUNCED_STATE bit would always show connected due to HPD being disabled
     - The detect() function couldn't properly detect display connection/disconnection
     - Performance degradation from PM runtime calls in detect()
  5. **No exploitable conditions**: The commit doesn't:
     - Fix any memory corruption issues
     - Address privilege escalation
     - Fix input validation problems
     - Resolve access control issues
     - Fix any condition that could be exploited by an attacker
  The issue is purely about incorrect display hotplug detection functionality in the DRM bridge driver, with no security implications.
1d1f7b15cb9c1 drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: make use of debugfs_init callback
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of Change**: This is a code refactoring/cleanup that changes how debugfs directories are created. It moves from creating a custom directory in the debugfs root to using the standard DRM bridge debugfs_init callback mechanism.
  2. **No Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. It's purely a structural improvement to align with the DRM bridge framework's standard debugfs initialization pattern.
  3. **No Security Impact**: 
     - The old code properly handled error conditions (checked for IS_ERR_OR_NULL)
     - The new code relies on the debugfs framework's built-in error handling
     - Both implementations create the same debugfs file with the same permissions (0600)
     - There's no memory leak fix, buffer overflow fix, privilege escalation fix, or any other security-relevant fix
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**:
     - Unlike commit 4 (CVE Status: YES) which fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could cause crashes
     - This commit is more similar to commits 1-3, 5 (CVE Status: NO) which are structural improvements or cleanups
  5. **Code Analysis**: The changes simply:
     - Remove the custom ti_sn65dsi86_debugfs_init() and ti_sn65dsi86_debugfs_remove() functions
     - Add a new debugfs_init callback to the bridge_funcs structure
     - Move the debugfs initialization from probe() to the standard bridge callback
  This is a straightforward refactoring to use the standard DRM bridge framework's debugfs initialization mechanism instead of custom code, with no security implications.
d02b2103a08b6 drm/i915: fix build error some more
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Build failure fix only**: This is purely a compile-time build error fix that occurs with specific compiler configurations (GCC with GCOV/AutoFDO). The change adds `__always_inline` to the `config_mask()` function to ensure proper inlining.
  2. **No runtime security impact**: The code change from `static u32 config_mask(const u64 config)` to `static __always_inline u32 config_mask(const u64 config)` only affects how the compiler handles the function - it doesn't change any runtime behavior or fix any security vulnerability.
  3. **Compiler optimization issue**: The problem is that without forced inlining, the compiler's `__builtin_constant_p()` evaluation can still treat the argument as constant even when the function isn't fully inlined, causing the BUILD_BUG_ON compile-time assertion to fail. This is a compiler/build system interaction issue, not a security flaw.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, all the build-related fixes (Similar Commit 1, 2, 4, 5) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", while only the NULL dereference fix (Similar Commit 3) received a CVE.
  The commit is fixing a build regression introduced by previous patches, ensuring the code compiles correctly across different compiler configurations. There's no security vulnerability being addressed here.
73eab78721f7b drm/amd: Adjust output for discovery error handling
- [sasha] Let me analyze the commit based on the provided diff. Looking at the changes:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is purely a logging/error handling improvement that:
  1. **Changes logging behavior only**: The main changes are:
     - Replaces `request_firmware()` with `firmware_request_nowarn()` to suppress kernel warnings
     - Changes `dev_err()` to `drm_info()` for optional firmware messages
     - Changes `dev_info()` to `drm_dbg()` for debug messages
     - Removes redundant error logging in `amdgpu_discovery_reg_base_init()`
  2. **No security-relevant code changes**: The commit only adjusts how errors and debug messages are displayed to users. There are no changes to:
     - Memory management
     - Access control
     - Input validation
     - Buffer handling
     - Race condition fixes
  3. **Cosmetic fix only**: This addresses user complaints about "noise about missing files and errors" when optional firmware files are not found. The fallback behavior (using hardcoded values) remains unchanged.
  4. **Referenced issue**: The GitLab issue #4312 referenced in the commit message is about excessive error messages, not a security vulnerability.
  The commit is similar to commits 1 and 2 in the examples (both marked "CVE Status: NO"), which also made non-security changes to the discovery code. In contrast, commits 3 and 5 (marked "CVE Status: YES") fixed actual memory allocation issues that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
fb721b2c35b18 drm: writeback: Fix drm_writeback_connector_cleanup signature
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me create a summary of my findings and provide the CVE assessment.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a function signature mismatch that could cause CFI (Control Flow Integrity) runtime checks to fail, but it does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **No actual vulnerability**: The code was functionally correct before the fix. The `drm_writeback_connector_cleanup` function was passed to `drmm_add_action_or_reset` with a cast, and the function would work correctly at runtime because:
     - The second parameter (`struct drm_writeback_connector *wb_connector`) would be passed as `void *data`
     - The function immediately casts it back: `struct drm_writeback_connector *wb_connector = data;`
  2. **CFI is a security hardening feature**: CONFIG_CFI_CLANG is a compile-time security hardening feature that adds runtime checks to verify function pointer calls match expected signatures. The mismatch would cause CFI checks to fail, but this is a false positive - not an exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The commit message explicitly states "the current code is valid and does not produce any warning." The issue only manifests when CFI runtime checks are enabled, causing legitimate code to be flagged incorrectly.
  4. **Type safety improvement**: This is a code quality/correctness fix to ensure proper type signatures match the expected callback type `drmres_release_t`. It prevents CFI false positives but doesn't fix any actual security issue.
  Unlike the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" which fixed actual vulnerabilities (NULL pointer dereferences, unhandled error conditions, use-after-free issues), this commit only fixes a type signature mismatch that causes security hardening checks to fail on valid code.
8d90d9872edae riscv: fix runtime constant support for nommu kernels
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The bug causes a kernel panic (crash) when specific conditions are met in NOMMU kernels, but it does not lead to:
     - Memory corruption that could be exploited
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Bypass of security boundaries
  2. **Specific triggering conditions**: The bug only occurs when:
     - Running on RISC-V NOMMU configurations (CONFIG_MMU disabled)
     - When patching runtime constants with val=0 (physical addresses below 4GiB boundary)
     - The incorrect code path leaves "random garbage" in a register, leading to an invalid pointer dereference and kernel panic
  3. **Impact is denial of service at worst**: The commit message clearly states the impact is a "kernel panic when that pointer is eventually accessed." This is a reliability/stability issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Logic error, not exploitable**: The bug is a simple logic error where the code could generate two NOPs instead of properly handling the zero case. The fix adds `|| lui_insn == RISCV_INSN_NOP4` to ensure the second instruction is properly generated when the first becomes a NOP.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical commits provided, this is more similar to "riscv: Fix early ftrace nop patching" (CVE Status: NO) which fixed crashes due to incorrect instruction patching, rather than the memory corruption issues in the CVE-assigned commits.
  The bug is a functional correctness issue that affects system stability in specific NOMMU configurations, but does not introduce exploitable security vulnerabilities.
f46d273449ba6 nvme: fix atomic write size validation
- [sasha] Now I can analyze the commit. Based on my examination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The issue is a functional bug in the atomic write size validation logic, not a security vulnerability. The problems are:
     - Incorrect mixing of namespace and controller values for atomic write sizes
     - Missing `queue_limits_cancel_update()` call in an error path that could lead to a mutex imbalance
     - Spurious failures for legitimate controller configurations
  2. **Impact is availability/functionality only**: The worst case scenario is:
     - Valid namespaces being rejected during probing (false negatives)
     - Potential mutex lock imbalance from the missing `queue_limits_cancel_update()` call
     - Neither of these creates security risks like privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption
  3. **No attack vector**: This is a logic error in device initialization/configuration code that affects legitimate device operations. There's no way for an attacker to exploit this for malicious purposes.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, particularly commit 1 (nvme: use srcu for iterating namespace list) which had "CVE Status: NO", that commit fixed potential deadlocks and synchronization issues but was not assigned a CVE. This atomic write validation fix is even less severe.
  The fix improves correctness and prevents spurious failures during NVMe namespace initialization, but does not address any security vulnerability.
b2e607fecac15 nvme: refactor the atomic write unit detection
- [sasha] Now I understand! The fix commit shows that the refactoring introduced a bug where it was using `ns->ctrl->awupf` instead of `ns->ctrl->subsys->awupf`. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Pure refactoring**: The commit is explicitly a refactoring that moves code from `nvme_update_disk_info()` into a new helper function `nvme_configure_atomic_write()`. The intent is to improve code organization, not fix a security issue.
  2. **No security vulnerability introduced**: While the refactoring does appear to have a functional bug (using `ns->ctrl->awupf` instead of the correct `ns->ctrl->subsys->awupf` as shown in the follow-up fix), this is not a security vulnerability. It's a functional correctness issue related to atomic write size validation in NVMe subsystems.
  3. **Impact is limited to functionality**: The bug would cause incorrect atomic write size calculations when different controllers in a subsystem report different values, but this doesn't lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
     - Buffer overflows
     
  4. **Error handling remains intact**: The code still includes proper error checking and logging when inconsistent atomic write sizes are detected.
  5. **Similar commits analysis**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of them were assigned CVEs despite making changes to NVMe subsystem behavior, including fixes for metadata handling and other functional issues.
  The subsequent fix commit (`f46d273449ba`) addresses the functional issue introduced by this refactoring, but neither commit represents a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
8d89661a36dd3 net: selftests: fix TCP packet checksum
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Test-only code**: The bug is in the network selftest infrastructure (`net/core/selftests.c`), which is only used for diagnostic testing through ethtool's self-test functionality. This code is not part of the normal network data path.
  2. **No security impact**: The incorrect TCP checksum calculation in the test packet generation would only cause the selftest to fail incorrectly. It doesn't affect:
     - Normal network traffic processing
     - System security or stability
     - Data integrity of actual network communications
     - Any privilege boundaries
  3. **Limited scope**: The code is only executed when:
     - CONFIG_NET_SELFTESTS is enabled
     - A user explicitly runs ethtool self-tests
     - The tests are run in offline mode only (as shown in line 386: "Only offline tests are supported")
  4. **Nature of the fix**: The change fixes a calculation error where `skb->len` (total packet length) was used instead of just the L4 payload length for the TCP pseudo-header checksum. This is a functional bug in test code, not a security vulnerability.
  The similar commits provided as reference (all marked "CVE Status: NO") also deal with checksum calculations in test/diagnostic code, reinforcing that such issues are not considered security vulnerabilities warranting CVE assignment.
7ab6847a03229 ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix built-in mic on ASUS VivoBook X507UAR
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This is a hardware-specific audio quirk fix that adds a device ID (PCI SSID 1043:1e10) for ASUS VivoBook X507UAR to use the `ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE` fixup. It only affects audio functionality (built-in microphone) on this specific laptop model.
  2. **Functional Regression Fix**: The commit fixes a functional regression introduced by commit 3b4309546b48, which changed the sorting behavior in the HDA auto-parser. This caused the microphone to stop working on certain ASUS laptops due to pin configuration ordering changes.
  3. **Similar Pattern to Non-CVE Commits**: All the similar commits (1-5) that fix the same type of regression for other ASUS models were marked as "CVE Status: NO", and this commit follows the exact same pattern:
     - Adds a single line to the quirk table
     - Uses the same fixup (`ALC256_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE`)
     - Fixes audio functionality, not a security issue
  4. **No Security Impact**: The change:
     - Does not fix any memory corruption issues
     - Does not fix any privilege escalation vulnerabilities
     - Does not fix any information disclosure issues
     - Does not fix any denial of service vulnerabilities
     - Only restores proper microphone functionality on a specific hardware model
  This is a typical hardware enablement/quirk fix in the ALSA HDA driver that addresses a functional regression, not a security vulnerability.
a433791aeaea6 atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  Based on my examination of the commit and the code, here's my analysis:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the commit changes and code analysis:
  1. **Race Condition Fix**: The commit fixes a race condition in `atm_dev_deregister()` where the mutex (`atm_dev_mutex`) was released too early at line 149 (before the fix), right after removing the device from the list but before removing procfs/sysfs entries.
  2. **Security Impact**: This race condition creates a window where:
     - Thread A calls `atm_dev_deregister()` and releases the mutex after `list_del(&dev->dev_list)`
     - Thread B calls `atm_dev_register()` with the same device number
     - Thread B's `__atm_dev_lookup()` doesn't find the device (it was removed from list)
     - Thread B proceeds to create procfs entries with the same name
     - Thread A then tries to remove procfs entries that Thread B is creating/has created
     
     This leads to the WARNING shown in the commit message about duplicate procfs entries.
  3. **Exploitability**: While the immediate symptom is a WARN_ON, this race condition could potentially be exploited to:
     - Cause resource leaks (procfs entries)
     - Create confusion in the procfs namespace
     - Potentially lead to use-after-free conditions if procfs operations race with cleanup
  4. **Similar CVE Patterns**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Several BCM-related commits that fix procfs cleanup races were assigned CVEs
     - The SPI commit fixing a use-after-free with mutex ordering was assigned a CVE
     - These show that mutex ordering issues around cleanup paths are considered security-relevant
  5. **Code Changes**: The fix moves the `mutex_unlock()` from line 149 to line 152, ensuring all cleanup operations (VCC release, sysfs unregister, procfs deregister) happen atomically under the lock. This prevents the race window entirely.
  The commit fixes a clear race condition that could lead to system instability and potential security issues through improper synchronization of kernel resources during device cleanup.
eef0eaeca7fa8 netlink: specs: tc: replace underscores with dashes in names
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Documentation-only change**: This commit only modifies a YAML specification file in Documentation/netlink/specs/tc.yaml. It doesn't change any actual kernel code, driver code, or runtime behavior.
  2. **Naming convention fix**: The change replaces underscores with dashes in field names (e.g., `Scell_log` → `Scell-log`, `def_DP` → `def-DP`) to comply with a stricter naming convention for netlink specs.
  3. **No security impact**: The commit message explicitly states this is for "more uniform naming in Python" and "makes no difference to C". The actual kernel structures in include/uapi/linux/pkt_sched.h still use underscores (Scell_log, def_DP).
  4. **Spec file purpose**: This YAML file is used for documentation and potentially code generation tools, not for the kernel's runtime behavior. It's part of the netlink protocol documentation infrastructure.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: All the similar commits with "CVE Status: NO" are also documentation/spec fixes that correct naming inconsistencies without affecting kernel functionality.
  This is a purely cosmetic documentation change with no security implications whatsoever.
7b515f35a911f net: enetc: Correct endianness handling in _enetc_rd_reg64
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is an endianness handling bug in statistics reading code (`_enetc_rd_reg64`) that only affects the display of network interface statistics through ethtool, not the actual network functionality or data path.
  2. **Limited impact**: 
     - The bug only manifests on big-endian systems that use the 32-bit implementation (when `ioread64` is not available)
     - As the commit message explicitly states: "no in-tree user of this driver is affected by this bug" because all supported platforms are little-endian
     - The function is only used for reading statistics counters in `enetc_get_ethtool_stats()`
  3. **No security implications**:
     - The bug only causes incorrect statistics display values
     - It does not affect:
       - Memory safety (no buffer overflows or memory corruption)
       - Access control or authentication
       - Network packet processing or data integrity
       - System availability or stability
     - Cannot be exploited for privilege escalation or denial of service
  4. **Code analysis**: The fix simply removes an incorrect `le64_to_cpu()` conversion:
     ```c
     - return le64_to_cpu((__le64)high << 32 | low);
     + return (u64)high << 32 | low;
     ```
     This change corrects the byte order interpretation but has no security impact.
  This is a functional bug fix for statistics reporting accuracy on hypothetical big-endian platforms, not a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
fa6f092cc0a02 libbpf: Fix possible use-after-free for externs
- [sasha] This is the key issue. Let me analyze the vulnerability:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in libbpf. Here's the security analysis:
  1. **Memory Safety Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly fixes a "possible use-after-free" bug where the `name` field in `obj->externs` points directly into BTF data. When functions like `bpf_map__set_value_size()` are called, they can invalidate the BTF data through reallocation (as shown in the commit that introduced the bug - 9d0a23313b1a).
  2. **Root Cause**: 
     - The original code stored direct pointers into BTF data: `ext->name = btf__name_by_offset(obj->btf, t->name_off);`
     - When `btf__add_array()` is called during map resizing, it can cause BTF data to be reallocated
     - This leaves `ext->name` pointing to freed memory
  3. **Impact**: 
     - Use-after-free bugs can lead to crashes, information disclosure, or potentially arbitrary code execution
     - The vulnerability occurs in a userspace library (libbpf) that is widely used for BPF program loading
     - Any application using libbpf that performs map resizing operations with externs present could trigger this bug
  4. **Exploit Conditions**:
     - An attacker would need to control BPF programs being loaded
     - The program must have externs defined
     - The attacker must trigger map resizing operations after initial BTF parsing
  5. **Fix**: The commit properly fixes this by making defensive copies of the strings using `strdup()` instead of storing direct pointers into BTF data.
  This is a classic memory management vulnerability in a security-sensitive component (BPF loading), making it appropriate for CVE assignment.
9a709b7e98e6f io_uring/net: mark iov as dynamically allocated even for single segments
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this warrants a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a memory leak in the io_uring network receive path when using bundled buffers. While it is a bug that could lead to kernel memory exhaustion under specific conditions, it does not meet the typical criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: This is a memory leak, not a memory corruption vulnerability. The leaked memory cannot be exploited to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or corrupt kernel state.
  2. **Local Attack Vector Only**: Exploiting this requires the ability to submit io_uring operations, which is typically restricted to local users with appropriate permissions.
  3. **Resource Exhaustion Only**: The worst-case scenario is denial of service through kernel memory exhaustion, which requires sustained exploitation and would be noticeable through memory monitoring.
  4. **Specific Conditions Required**: The leak only occurs when using `IORING_RECVSEND_BUNDLE` flag with a specific pattern where `io_buffers_peek()` allocates memory but returns only a single segment.
  The fix is important for correctness and preventing resource leaks, but similar to the reference commits provided (which also dealt with cleanup flag handling in io_uring and were marked as "CVE Status: NO"), this represents a bug fix rather than a security vulnerability requiring CVE assignment.
c55c7a85e02a7 um: ubd: Add missing error check in start_io_thread()
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the actual security impact of the missing error check:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a simple error handling bug where the return value from the first `os_set_fd_block()` call was being overwritten by the second call, causing the first error to be lost. 
  The issue is:
  1. The code calls `os_set_fd_block(*fd_out, 0)` to set non-blocking I/O on the first file descriptor
  2. It then immediately overwrites `err` with the result of `os_set_fd_block(kernel_fd, 0)` for the second file descriptor
  3. If the first call failed but the second succeeded, the error would be lost
  While this is a bug that could cause the I/O thread to operate with incorrect file descriptor settings (potentially having one FD in blocking mode when it should be non-blocking), this does not constitute a security vulnerability:
  1. **No privilege escalation**: The bug doesn't allow unprivileged code to gain elevated privileges
  2. **No memory corruption**: There's no buffer overflow, use-after-free, or other memory safety issue
  3. **No information disclosure**: The bug doesn't leak sensitive information
  4. **Limited impact**: The worst case is that the UBD (User Mode Linux Block Device) driver might have degraded performance or functionality if one FD remains in blocking mode
  5. **Local only**: This only affects the UML (User Mode Linux) subsystem, which runs as a regular user process
  The bug is simply a logic error in error handling that could cause the driver to operate incorrectly but doesn't create any exploitable security condition. This is similar to the other "NO CVE" examples shown, which fixed various non-security bugs like incorrect return values or missing error checks that don't create security vulnerabilities.
9caca6ac0e26c bnxt: properly flush XDP redirect lists
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security-relevant factors:
  1. **Memory Corruption Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a list corruption bug that causes a kernel crash with "list_add corruption" error. The corruption occurs in the cpu_map_flush_list, which is a critical kernel data structure.
  2. **Exploitable Condition**: The issue can be reliably reproduced in production environments when using XDP_REDIRECT functionality. An attacker could potentially trigger this by crafting XDP programs that return XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT randomly.
  3. **System Crash/DoS**: The vulnerability leads to a kernel panic (BUG at lib/list_debug.c:29), resulting in a complete system crash and denial of service.
  4. **Root Cause**: The bug is caused by missing XDP flush operations on redirect lists. The code change shows that the `event` variable containing BNXT_REDIRECT_EVENT was being overwritten before the flush check, causing xdp_do_flush() to never be called when needed.
  5. **Similar to Other CVE-worthy Commits**: The referenced similar commits with "CVE Status: YES" also fix critical bugs in network drivers that lead to memory corruption or system crashes (double DMA unmapping, RX consumer index corruption).
  The fix is simple but critical - it preserves the redirect event state in a separate `flush_xdp` boolean to ensure proper flushing of XDP redirect lists, preventing the list corruption that leads to kernel crashes.
22bbc1dcd0d67 vsock/uapi: fix linux/vm_sockets.h userspace compilation errors
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can provide the following assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a userspace header compilation fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit simply adds the necessary `#include <sys/socket.h>` statement for userspace applications to compile correctly when including the `vm_sockets.h` header.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes only affect compilation of userspace applications. There is no:
     - Memory corruption or buffer overflow fix
     - Access control or permission bypass fix
     - Input validation improvement
     - Race condition fix
     - Information disclosure fix
     - Any other security-relevant pattern
  3. **Build issue only**: The error messages shown in the commit message are compilation errors, not runtime security issues:
     - "invalid application of 'sizeof' to incomplete type 'struct sockaddr'"
     - "'sa_family_t' undeclared here"
  4. **Standard header fix**: The commit follows an established pattern already used in other kernel headers (`<linux/mptcp.h>` and `<linux/if.h>`), as mentioned in the commit message.
  5. **No functional change**: This change doesn't modify any kernel behavior, runtime logic, or security boundaries. It only ensures userspace applications can properly include and use the header file.
  This is a typical build system/API usability fix that improves the developer experience but has no security implications whatsoever.
0748e553df022 userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to make a determination. Let me check the historical similar commits to understand the pattern better:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a resource leak vulnerability (memory leak) that occurs in the open_tree_attr(2) system call. The vulnerability happens when:
  1. `wants_mount_setattr()` returns a positive value (indicating resources were allocated via `build_mount_kattr()` -> `build_mount_idmapped()`)
  2. `do_mount_setattr()` subsequently fails
  3. In the old code, when `do_mount_setattr()` failed, the function would return immediately without calling `finish_mount_kattr()`, leaking the `mnt_userns` and potentially `mnt_idmap` that were allocated
  The fix ensures that `finish_mount_kattr()` is always called when `wants_mount_setattr()` returns positive, regardless of whether `do_mount_setattr()` succeeds or fails. This prevents the memory leak by properly releasing the user namespace reference (via `put_user_ns()`) and the mount idmap (via `mnt_idmap_put()`).
  This is similar to the first historical example which was assigned a CVE - both involve resource leaks where cleanup functions aren't called in error paths, potentially leading to memory exhaustion if exploited repeatedly.
d87c3ca0f8f1c wifi: mac80211: finish link init before RCU publish
- [sasha] Now let me examine what the specific code change in the commit under analysis does. Looking at the diff, the change moves the RCU pointer assignments from the beginning of `ieee80211_link_init()` to the end:
  **Before (lines removed):**
  ```c
  rcu_assign_pointer(sdata->vif.link_conf[link_id], link_conf);
  rcu_assign_pointer(sdata->link[link_id], link);
  ```
  **After (lines added at the end):**
  ```c
  rcu_assign_pointer(sdata->vif.link_conf[link_id], link_conf);
  rcu_assign_pointer(sdata->link[link_id], link);
  ```
  The key insight is that between these two positions, the function performs initialization of the link data structures, including setting up various fields, work queues, and calling `ieee80211_link_debugfs_add()`.
  ## Analysis:
  This is a **race condition fix**. The issue is that when RCU pointers are published early (at the beginning of the function), other concurrent code paths can access these pointers via RCU and see partially initialized data structures. This could lead to:
  1. **Use of uninitialized data**: Other threads could access fields that haven't been set up yet
  2. **NULL pointer dereferences**: If initialization involves setting up pointers that are initially NULL
  3. **Incorrect behavior**: Work queues and other structures might not be properly initialized when accessed
  By moving the RCU pointer assignments to the end of the initialization function, the code ensures that the data structures are fully initialized before they become visible to other threads through RCU lookups.
  Looking at the similar commits:
  - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed an RCU protection issue with missing locking
  - Similar Commit 4 (CVE: YES) - Fixed a use-after-free vulnerability
  This commit fixes a race condition that could lead to accessing uninitialized or partially initialized data structures, which is a security concern similar to the RCU-related issues in the similar commits that were assigned CVEs.
  ## Decision:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a race condition where partially initialized link structures could be accessed by concurrent threads through RCU-protected pointers
  2. This could lead to use of uninitialized memory, potential NULL pointer dereferences, or other undefined behavior
  3. The pattern is similar to other RCU-related race condition fixes in the WiFi subsystem that have been assigned CVEs
  4. The commit message explicitly states this is fixing an ordering issue to ensure data is "actually set up before publishing the structures"
  5. Race conditions in kernel code, especially in networking subsystems, are considered security vulnerabilities as they can potentially be exploited to cause denial of service or other security impacts
90233b0ad215e wifi: mac80211: Create separate links for VLAN interfaces
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit "wifi: mac80211: Create separate links for VLAN interfaces", I have identified a critical security vulnerability:
  **NO**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The vulnerability is a **NULL pointer dereference** that can lead to a kernel crash/denial of service.
  The security issue is in the `ieee80211_link_init()` function in `net/mac80211/link.c`:
  ```c
  if (sdata->vif.type == NL80211_IFTYPE_AP_VLAN) {
      struct ieee80211_sub_if_data *ap_bss;
      struct ieee80211_bss_conf *ap_bss_conf;
      ap_bss = container_of(sdata->bss,
                            struct ieee80211_sub_if_data, u.ap);
      ap_bss_conf = sdata_dereference(ap_bss->vif.link_conf[link_id],
                                      ap_bss);
      memcpy(link_conf, ap_bss_conf, sizeof(*link_conf));
  }
  ```
  The vulnerability occurs because:
  1. **No NULL check on `sdata->bss`**: The code uses `container_of(sdata->bss, ...)` without first checking if `sdata->bss` is NULL. For AP_VLAN interfaces, `sdata->bss` could be NULL if the VLAN interface is created but not yet associated with an AP.
  2. **No NULL check on `ap_bss_conf`**: The result of `sdata_dereference(ap_bss->vif.link_conf[link_id], ap_bss)` is not checked for NULL before being used in `memcpy()`. If `link_conf[link_id]` is NULL, this will cause a NULL pointer dereference.
  3. **No bounds check on `link_id`**: While `link_id` is used as an array index, there's no explicit validation that it's within bounds before accessing `ap_bss->vif.link_conf[link_id]`.
  This can be triggered by:
  - Creating an AP_VLAN interface without proper AP association
  - Creating an AP_VLAN interface with an invalid link_id
  - Race conditions during interface teardown where the AP might be removed while VLANs still reference it
  The impact is a kernel crash (denial of service) that could be triggered by unprivileged users who can create network interfaces or by remote attackers if they can influence VLAN creation through management protocols.
  This is similar to previous mac80211 vulnerabilities like the one fixed in commit ff05d4b45dd8 ("wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free") which also involved missing NULL checks leading to crashes.
f61c7b3d442be wifi: mac80211: Add link iteration macro for link data
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **It's a refactoring/feature addition**: The commit adds a new iteration macro `for_each_link_data()` that provides a cleaner way to iterate through valid links. This is infrastructure code that doesn't fix any existing vulnerability.
  2. **No NULL pointer dereference fix**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES" (like the iwlwifi fix), this commit doesn't fix a NULL pointer dereference. The macro actually includes proper validation checks:
     - It checks if `vif.valid_links` is set
     - It verifies the specific link_id bit is set in valid_links
     - It safely dereferences using `sdata_dereference()`
  3. **Part of a feature series**: This commit is part of a series adding VLAN MLD link support, not a security fix. The subsequent commit (90233b0ad215) uses this macro for new functionality, not to fix existing bugs.
  4. **No security impact mentioned**: The commit message describes it as addressing "open-coding" issues for cleaner code, not fixing any security vulnerabilities or potential crashes.
  5. **Preventive infrastructure**: While the macro does add safety checks that could prevent future NULL dereferences, it's proactive infrastructure rather than a reactive security fix.
  The key difference from CVE-worthy commits is that this adds new safe infrastructure rather than fixing an existing exploitable vulnerability.
2a5a4841846b0 af_unix: Don't set -ECONNRESET for consumed OOB skb.
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the broader context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This is a behavioral/correctness fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses an issue where closing an AF_UNIX socket incorrectly sets ECONNRESET on the peer socket even when all data (including OOB data) has been properly consumed.
  Key reasons this is NOT a security issue:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The bug only affects error reporting between cooperating processes using AF_UNIX socketpairs. There's no privilege escalation, information disclosure, or unauthorized access.
  2. **Limited impact**: The worst case is that applications receive an unexpected ECONNRESET error, which could confuse application logic but doesn't compromise security.
  3. **Nature of the fix**: The code change simply skips consumed OOB skbs when checking whether to set ECONNRESET. It's fixing incorrect behavior, not a security flaw.
  4. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, the ones that received CVEs (commits 4 and 5) involved actual security issues like potential use-after-free conditions and garbage collection problems. This commit is more similar to commits 1-3, which were behavioral fixes that did NOT receive CVEs.
  5. **The fix prevents false errors**: The change ensures ECONNRESET is only set when there's actual unread data, preventing spurious errors that could confuse applications but pose no security risk.
  This is a quality improvement that fixes incorrect error reporting behavior in AF_UNIX OOB handling, not a security vulnerability.
7a3750ff0f2e8 wifi: mac80211: fix beacon interval calculation overflow
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is an integer overflow in the calculation of beacon intervals when converting from Time Units (TU) to microseconds. The original code used a `u16` type which overflows when `beacon_int * 1024` exceeds 65535.
  2. **Impact analysis**:
     - The overflow affects the DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Message) count calculation in `ieee80211_recalc_dtim()`
     - DTIM count is used for power save functionality in Wi-Fi to indicate when broadcast/multicast frames are buffered
     - The incorrect calculation would result in wrong DTIM count values, potentially affecting power save behavior
     - The impact is limited to incorrect power management timing, not a security vulnerability
  3. **No security implications**:
     - The bug does not enable privilege escalation
     - It does not allow unauthorized access or information disclosure
     - It does not cause memory corruption or allow code execution
     - It does not create a denial of service condition beyond potential power inefficiency
     - The affected `dtim_count` is merely used for beacon generation and power save coordination
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (NO CVE): Fixed integer overflow in metric calculations - also a calculation error without security impact
     - Similar Commit 3 (YES CVE): Fixed out-of-bounds array access - this is a memory safety issue that could lead to crashes or exploitation
     - This commit is more similar to Commit 1 - just a calculation error without memory safety implications
  The fix simply changes the variable type from `u16` to `u32` to accommodate the full range of values, preventing the overflow. This is a functional correctness fix rather than a security fix.
7544f3f5b0b58 bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following security-critical factors:
  1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities**: The commit explicitly fixes two use-after-free bugs in the bridge multicast router port configuration, as evidenced by the KASAN reports showing:
     - `slab-out-of-bounds` write access
     - `slab-use-after-free` read access
  2. **Memory Corruption Impact**: The code changes show that without this fix, the system was accessing freed memory when traversing router port lists. The added code in `br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit()` properly removes ports from router lists to prevent accessing stale pointers:
     ```c
     spin_lock_bh(&br->multicast_lock);
     del |= br_ip6_multicast_rport_del(pmctx);
     del |= br_ip4_multicast_rport_del(pmctx);
     br_multicast_rport_del_notify(pmctx, del);
     spin_unlock_bh(&br->multicast_lock);
     ```
  3. **Exploitable Attack Vector**: The vulnerability can be triggered through normal network configuration commands (adding/deleting bridge ports and VLANs), making it accessible to local attackers with network configuration privileges.
  4. **Similar Historical Patterns**: The referenced similar commits with CVE Status: YES all involve use-after-free vulnerabilities in the bridge multicast code, establishing a clear pattern that such bugs warrant CVE assignment.
  5. **Root Cause**: The bug stems from incomplete cleanup when ports are deleted - the multicast router timer deletion alone was insufficient as it didn't handle permanent router states (state 2), leaving dangling references in router port lists.
d5e3241c5a386 ethernet: ionic: Fix DMA mapping tests
- [sasha] **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  This is a critical security vulnerability in the ionic Ethernet driver's DMA mapping error handling. The bug occurs because:
  1. **Incorrect error value**: The functions return 0 on DMA mapping failure instead of `DMA_MAPPING_ERROR` (which is ~0 or 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
  2. **Valid address collision**: On many systems, 0 is a valid DMA address. When a DMA mapping fails and returns 0, the driver may incorrectly use address 0 for DMA operations.
  3. **Security impacts**:
     - **Memory corruption**: The network device could perform DMA reads/writes to physical address 0, potentially corrupting critical kernel data structures
     - **Information disclosure**: DMA reads from address 0 could leak sensitive kernel memory contents over the network
     - **Remote exploitation**: Attackers could trigger DMA mapping failures through memory pressure via network traffic
  The code changes show this pattern in multiple places:
  ```c
  // Before (VULNERABLE):
  if (!dma_addr)  // 0 treated as error, but 0 is valid address!
      return -EIO;
  // After (FIXED):
  if (dma_addr == DMA_MAPPING_ERROR)  // Correct error checking
      return -EIO;
  ```
  This vulnerability is similar to the CVE-assigned commits shown in the examples, which involved memory corruption and use-after-free bugs that could lead to kernel compromise.
f599020702698 net: netpoll: Initialize UDP checksum field before checksumming
- [sasha] Perfect! This demonstrates the issue. Now let me analyze the security impact:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Functional bug, not a security vulnerability**: The issue is that netpoll's IPv6 UDP packets would have incorrect checksums, causing them to be dropped by receivers. This is a denial of service to the netpoll functionality itself, not a vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers.
  2. **Limited scope and impact**: 
     - Netpoll is used for debugging/diagnostic features like netconsole (network console logging)
     - It's not enabled by default in most configurations
     - The bug only affects IPv6, not IPv4 (IPv4 path correctly initializes udph->check = 0)
     - Packets with bad checksums are simply dropped by receivers - no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data leakage
  3. **No attacker-controlled path**: 
     - The uninitialized value comes from kernel stack memory allocated by find_skb()
     - An attacker cannot control what garbage value ends up in udph->check
     - The only impact is that legitimate netpoll IPv6 packets fail to transmit
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - "netpoll: Ensure clean state on setup failures" (NO CVE) - cleanup/reliability fix
     - "netpoll: move netpoll_send_skb() out of line" (NO CVE) - code reorganization  
     - "netpoll: netpoll_send_skb() returns transmit status" (NO CVE) - API improvement
  The code change shows that `csum_partial(udph, udp_len, 0)` includes the UDP header's checksum field in its calculation. Without zeroing it first, whatever garbage value is in that memory location becomes part of the checksum, resulting in an incorrect value that causes packet drops. This is a functional correctness issue, not a security vulnerability.
aa485e8789d56 libbpf: Fix null pointer dereference in btf_dump__free on allocation failure
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the code and commit, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a null pointer dereference that occurs only during error handling when memory allocation fails. The bug happens when:
     - `btf_dump__new()` fails to allocate memory for `type_names` hashmap
     - Sets `d->type_names = NULL` (line 175)
     - Calls `goto err` which calls `btf_dump__free(d)`
     - `btf_dump__free()` then calls `hashmap__free(d->type_names)` directly
  2. **Limited impact**: 
     - This only occurs during initialization failure due to memory allocation issues
     - It's not exploitable by malicious input or remote attackers
     - The crash happens in userspace tooling (libbpf), not in kernel code
     - It requires specific error conditions (memory allocation failure) to trigger
  3. **Comparison to similar commits**:
     - The CVE-assigned commits (Similar Commits 1 & 2) fixed null pointer dereferences that could occur during normal operation with malformed or specific BTF data, making them exploitable through crafted input
     - Similar Commit 3 (no CVE) also fixed a null pointer check but in a different context
     - This commit fixes a bug that only manifests during error handling of allocation failures
  4. **Code analysis shows**:
     - The fix adds a NULL check in `btf_dump_free_names()` function (line 229)
     - Before the fix, `hashmap__free()` was being called on NULL pointers when allocation failed
     - While `hashmap__free()` itself checks for NULL, the issue was that `btf_dump_free_names()` was attempting to iterate through the hashmap entries before calling `hashmap__free()`
  This is a bug fix for proper error handling rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
ce7df19686530 attach_recursive_mnt(): do not lock the covering tree when sliding something under it
- [sasha] Now let me write up my analysis of this commit.
  ## Analysis
  Based on my examination of the code changes and context, here is my security analysis:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  ## Explanation:
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability related to mount namespace isolation when propagating mounts across user namespace boundaries. The issue is in the order of operations:
  1. **The vulnerability**: The original code was calling `mnt_change_mountpoint()` to reparent existing mounts (`q`) BEFORE applying security locks via `lock_mnt_tree()`. This means that preexisting mounts that get slid under a new mount would inherit security-critical flags (MNT_LOCKED, MNT_LOCK_READONLY, MNT_LOCK_NODEV, etc.) that they should not have.
  2. **Security impact**: The `lock_mnt_tree()` function applies critical security restrictions when crossing user namespace boundaries:
     - MNT_LOCK_ATIME - prevents changing access time behavior
     - MNT_LOCK_READONLY - prevents making read-only mounts writable
     - MNT_LOCK_NODEV - prevents device access
     - MNT_LOCK_NOSUID - prevents setuid execution
     - MNT_LOCK_NOEXEC - prevents execution
     - MNT_LOCKED - prevents revealing what's under a mount
  3. **The fix**: By moving `lock_mnt_tree()` before `mnt_change_mountpoint()`, the commit ensures that only the new mounts being propagated get locked, while preexisting mounts that are being repositioned maintain their original permissions.
  4. **Attack scenario**: Without this fix, an attacker could potentially:
     - Mount something in a less privileged namespace
     - Have it propagated and slid under another mount
     - The preexisting mount would incorrectly inherit restrictive flags
     - This could potentially be exploited to bypass mount restrictions or cause denial of service
  The commit message explicitly states this is fixing improper locking of "the stuff that had been there before" when "sliding a new tree under that", which confirms this is addressing a security boundary issue between user namespaces.
fb4e2a6e8f28a ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()
- [sasha] Perfect! Now I can analyze the vulnerability:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE based on the following analysis:
  1. **Out-of-bounds read vulnerability**: The code allocates a buffer based on `wLength` received from a USB device without validating that the length is sufficient to contain a `uac3_cluster_header_descriptor` structure. The structure is at least 7 bytes (`sizeof(struct uac3_cluster_header_descriptor)`).
  2. **Attacker-controlled value**: The `wLength` value comes from `hc_header.wLength` which is obtained via `snd_usb_ctl_msg()` from the USB device. A malicious USB device can return any value for `wLength`.
  3. **Security impact**: After allocation with `kzalloc(wLength, GFP_KERNEL)`, the code immediately dereferences the buffer as a `uac3_cluster_header_descriptor` at line 1013 (`num_channels = cluster->bNrChannels`). If `wLength` is less than 7 bytes, this results in an out-of-bounds read beyond the allocated buffer.
  4. **Similar to previous CVEs**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown with CVE status YES, particularly:
     - Out-of-bounds reads in USB audio descriptor parsing
     - Missing length validation before casting/dereferencing structures
     - Trusting device-provided length values without validation
  5. **Fix validates the issue**: The fix adds the critical check `if (wLength < sizeof(cluster))` before allocation, preventing the out-of-bounds read. The fix in this case checks against `sizeof(cluster)` which appears to be incorrect (should be `sizeof(*cluster)` or `sizeof(struct uac3_cluster_header_descriptor)`), but the intent is clear - to prevent allocation of undersized buffers.
  This is a classic USB descriptor parsing vulnerability where device-controlled data is trusted without proper validation, leading to potential kernel memory disclosure or crashes when a malicious USB device is connected.
1d6123102e9fb Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Clear Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: The commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in `vhci_flush()` that occurs when one thread closes a vhci file descriptor while another thread is performing an ioctl operation on the same device. The KASAN report clearly shows memory being accessed after it was freed.
  2. **Race Condition with Security Impact**: The vulnerability is caused by a race condition where `hci_unregister_dev()` unlinks the hdev from `hci_dev_list` but doesn't wait for other threads that may still be accessing the device. This allows `hci_dev_reset()` to call `hdev->flush()` (which is `vhci_flush()`) on already-freed memory.
  3. **Exploitable Attack Vector**: The vulnerability can be triggered through normal user operations - opening/closing file descriptors and calling ioctl() operations on Bluetooth virtual HCI devices. This makes it potentially exploitable by unprivileged users.
  4. **Memory Corruption Consequences**: Use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, potential code execution, or system crashes. The stack trace shows this caused a kernel panic.
  5. **Similar to Previous CVE-assigned Issues**: The commit is similar in nature to other Bluetooth use-after-free fixes that have received CVEs, particularly those involving race conditions during device unregistration (as seen in the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES").
  The fix implements SRCU (Sleepable Read-Copy-Update) synchronization to ensure that `hci_unregister_dev()` waits for all ongoing operations to complete before freeing the device, preventing the use-after-free condition.
dc6458ed95e40 ASoC: amd: ps: fix for soundwire failures during hibernation exit sequence
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional bug fix for audio hardware initialization after hibernation, not a security vulnerability. The commit addresses SoundWire (audio interface) failures during hibernation exit by properly saving and restoring two hardware registers:
     - `ACP_SW0_PAD_KEEPER_EN`: Controls pad keeper enable for SoundWire interface
     - `ACP_PAD_PULLDOWN_CTRL`: Controls pad pulldown settings
  2. **Impact analysis**: The issue only affects audio functionality - when these registers aren't properly restored after hibernation, the SoundWire manager links don't power on correctly, resulting in:
     - Peripheral register access failures
     - Complete audio function breakdown
     - No security implications like privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure
  3. **Code changes examination**: The changes in `ps-common.c` show:
     - In suspend: Saves register values to `adata->acp_sw_pad_keeper_en` and `adata->acp_pad_pulldown_ctrl`
     - In resume: Checks if registers were reset (value is 0) and restores the saved values
     - This is standard hardware state preservation/restoration during power management
  4. **No security boundaries crossed**: This is purely a hardware configuration issue within the audio subsystem that doesn't:
     - Expose sensitive data
     - Allow unauthorized access
     - Enable code execution
     - Cause memory safety issues
  The commit is similar to the provided historical examples marked as "CVE Status: NO", which also dealt with audio device configuration and power management issues without security implications.
b993ea46b3b60 atm: clip: prevent NULL deref in clip_push()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that causes a kernel crash. The issue occurs when `vcc_destroy_socket()` calls `clip_push()` with a NULL skb, and the function attempts to access `skb->truesize` before checking if skb is NULL. This happens when `clip_devs` is NULL during socket destruction. The vulnerability can be triggered by local users with the ability to create ATM sockets, resulting in a denial of service condition. Similar memory safety fixes in the kernel networking stack have consistently received CVEs.
85d6fbc47c308 scsi: fnic: Fix missing DMA mapping error in fnic_send_frame()
- [sasha] Looking at this commit, I need to analyze whether it fixes a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE.
  Let me examine the change in detail:
  **What the commit fixes:**
  - Adds a missing error check for `dma_map_single()` using `dma_mapping_error()`
  - If DMA mapping fails, the function now returns `-ENOMEM` instead of proceeding with an invalid DMA address
  **Security implications:**
  1. **Invalid DMA address usage**: Without this check, if `dma_map_single()` fails, the code would use an invalid DMA address (`pa`) in the `fnic_queue_wq_desc()` call. This could lead to:
     - Writing to arbitrary memory locations
     - Potential memory corruption
     - System instability or crashes
     - In worst case, potential for exploitation if an attacker can control conditions that cause DMA mapping failures
  2. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at the similar commits with CVE status:
     - Similar Commit 1, 2, 3 (CVE Status: YES) all involved DMA mapping/unmapping errors that could lead to memory corruption or invalid memory access
     - The pattern is very similar - missing proper DMA error handling that could result in using invalid addresses
  3. **Attack vector**: While triggering DMA mapping failures might require specific conditions (memory pressure, IOMMU issues), the security impact of using invalid DMA addresses is significant.
  **CVE Decision: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a missing error check that could lead to use of invalid DMA addresses
  2. The security impact includes potential memory corruption and system instability
  3. The pattern matches other CVE-assigned commits that fixed similar DMA mapping error handling issues
  4. Using invalid DMA addresses for hardware operations poses a real security risk, as it could lead to arbitrary memory access by the hardware device
  The commit clearly fixes a security vulnerability where the absence of proper error handling could compromise system integrity through invalid memory operations.
3c70ec71abdaf cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit "cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion", here is my assessment:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  The commit fixes multiple security vulnerabilities that can lead to kernel crashes:
  1. **Type Confusion Vulnerability**: The original code blindly calls `pci_get_drvdata(pdev)` and casts the result to `struct cxl_dev_state *` without verifying that the device is actually a CXL device bound to the cxl_pci driver. If the CPER record identifies a non-CXL PCIe device, `pci_get_drvdata()` will return driver data with a completely different structure, leading to type confusion when accessing `cxlds->cxlmd`.
  2. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: While the code checks if `cxlds` is NULL, it doesn't verify that `pdev->dev.driver` exists before calling `pci_get_drvdata()`. For unbound devices, this could return garbage data that passes the NULL check but causes crashes when dereferenced.
  3. **Invalid Memory Access**: The vulnerability allows processing of arbitrary PCIe devices as if they were CXL memory devices. The code accesses `cxlds->cxlmd` which assumes a specific memory layout that only exists for devices bound to the cxl_pci driver.
  The fix properly validates the device by:
  - Moving the device lock to where it's actually needed
  - Checking if the device has a driver bound (`pdev->dev.driver`)
  - Using `bus_find_device()` to verify that a `cxl_memdev` exists with this PCIe device as its parent
  - Only then safely accessing the CXL-specific data structures
  This vulnerability could be triggered by malformed CPER records (from firmware or potentially from malicious hardware) that specify non-CXL devices, leading to kernel crashes or potentially information disclosure through type confusion.
f3054152c12e2 HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()
- [sasha] Now I understand the vulnerability clearly. Let me summarize:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because it fixes a use-after-free vulnerability that can cause kernel crashes.
  The vulnerability occurs because:
  1. The `wacom` structure is allocated with `devm_kzalloc()` (drivers/hid/wacom_sys.c:2834), which means it's automatically freed when the device is removed.
  2. The commit fd2a9b29dc9c introduced `wacom_aes_battery_handler()` as a delayed work that accesses the `wacom` structure via `container_of(work, struct wacom, aes_battery_work.work)`.
  3. In `wacom_remove()`, the delayed work `aes_battery_work` was not being canceled before the function returns. This creates a race condition where:
     - The device is removed and the `wacom` structure is freed (due to devm_kzalloc)
     - The delayed work is still pending and executes later
     - `wacom_aes_battery_handler()` tries to access the freed `wacom` structure, causing a use-after-free
  4. The commit message explicitly states this causes "hard crashes or 'Oops: general protection fault...'" particularly "with built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work was still pending at the time of hibernation."
  The fix is simple but critical - adding `cancel_delayed_work_sync(&wacom->aes_battery_work)` in `wacom_remove()` ensures the delayed work is canceled before the `wacom` structure is freed.
  This is a classic use-after-free vulnerability with demonstrated exploitability (crashes on resume from hibernate) and should receive a CVE.
73f3a7415d93c HID: Intel-thc-hid: Intel-quicki2c: Enhance QuickI2C reset flow
- [sasha] Now I can see the exact change. The patch adds a fallback mechanism to manually read the reset response if the interrupt-based mechanism fails. This is clearly a reliability enhancement, not a security fix.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes enhance the QuickI2C reset flow to handle cases where touch devices fail to send interrupts or when THC hardware misses reset interrupts due to timing issues. This is a reliability/robustness improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
  Specific analysis of the code changes:
  1. The patch adds a manual read of the reset response after the interrupt timeout (lines 227-232)
  2. It validates the response by checking if the packet length is zero, which indicates a valid reset response (lines 238-243)
  3. The read operation uses pre-allocated buffers with proper size (input_buf is allocated with at least 4KB, reading only 2 bytes)
  4. There are no memory safety issues, privilege escalations, or security boundary violations
  5. The issue being fixed is a device initialization failure that requires a reboot - an availability issue, not a security vulnerability
  This is similar to the other "NO CVE" commits in the reference set that fix timing issues, device initialization problems, or enhance driver reliability without addressing actual security vulnerabilities.
f16873f42a06b drm/xe: move DPT l2 flush to a more sensible place
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a performance optimization that moves an L2 cache flush operation to a more appropriate location. The change moves `xe_device_l2_flush(xe)` from being called for all framebuffer pinning operations to only being called specifically for DPT (Display Page Table) updates where it's actually needed.
  The commit message explicitly states this is moving the flush to a "more sensible place" and that "Normal GGTT updates don't need special flush" - indicating this is purely an optimization to avoid unnecessary cache flushes. The code changes show the flush being removed from the general path and added only after DPT writes.
  This is not fixing any security vulnerability, but rather eliminating redundant operations that were introduced by the referenced workaround (Wa_16023588340) for Intel BMG graphics hardware.
a4b1b51ae132a drm/xe: Move DSB l2 flush to a more sensible place
- [sasha] Now I understand the context better. Let me analyze this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a performance optimization that moves the L2 cache flush from being called after every individual DSB buffer write/memset operation to being called once at the end when all data has been written (in `intel_dsb_buffer_flush_map()`).
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit is fixing inefficient placement of cache flushes, not a security issue. The workaround (Wa_16023588340) requires L2 cache flushes for display coherency when CPU writes to VRAM are cached in GPU L2. The original code was overly conservative by flushing after each write.
  3. **Code analysis shows**:
     - Removed `xe_device_l2_flush()` calls from `intel_dsb_buffer_write()` and `intel_dsb_buffer_memset()`
     - Added the flush to `intel_dsb_buffer_flush_map()` which is called after all DSB commands are written
     - This is the correct pattern - flush once after all writes complete
  4. **Similar to analyzed commit**: The related commit in `drm-xe-dpt-l2-flush-security-analysis.md` was also a performance optimization moving L2 flushes to more appropriate locations and was correctly assessed as not requiring a CVE.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no vulnerability being fixed - the display would function correctly either way, just less efficiently with the original code.
  This is a legitimate performance improvement that reduces unnecessary cache flush operations while maintaining the required hardware workaround behavior.
9205999e9f13a drm/i915/snps_hdmi_pll: Fix 64-bit divisor truncation by using div64_u64
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. The issue is a 64-bit divisor truncation in HDMI PLL calculations where `CURVE2_MULTIPLIER` (1,000,000,000,000) gets truncated to 3,567,587,328 when passed to `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL`, which internally uses `do_div()` expecting a 32-bit divisor.
  While this causes incorrect PLL calculations affecting HDMI display output on DG2 graphics hardware, it has no security implications:
  - No memory safety issues (no buffer overflows, UAF, etc.)
  - No privilege escalation potential
  - No information disclosure
  - Limited to display functionality on specific hardware
  - Not remotely exploitable
  This is similar to the other division-related fixes in the examples provided, which were all correctly marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they fix functional calculation bugs in drivers without security impact.
62207293479e6 drm/xe/display: Add check for alloc_ordered_workqueue()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit adds a missing error check for `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` which can return NULL on memory allocation failure. While this is a bug fix that prevents a potential NULL pointer dereference, it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment because:
  1. **Resource exhaustion context**: The failure of `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` typically occurs only under memory pressure/exhaustion conditions, which is not considered a security vulnerability in the kernel context.
  2. **Limited impact**: The issue would cause a NULL pointer dereference when `queue_work()` is called on the NULL `dp_wq` workqueue during hotplug operations. This would result in a kernel crash, but:
     - It requires the system to be already under severe memory pressure
     - It's a DoS at most, not privilege escalation or information disclosure
     - The crash would happen during driver initialization, not runtime
  3. **Similar fixes without CVEs**: Looking at the historical commits, there are many similar fixes for missing `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` checks in the DRM subsystem (e.g., commits for msm, omapdrm, vkms drivers) that were not assigned CVEs.
  4. **Not exploitable**: This is not practically exploitable by an attacker as they cannot reliably control memory allocation failures during driver initialization.
  The commit is a proper defensive programming fix to handle allocation failures gracefully, but it addresses a theoretical issue under extreme conditions rather than a security vulnerability.
99579c55c3d61 drm/amdgpu/mes: add compatibility checks for set_hw_resource_1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds compatibility checks for older MES firmware versions that don't properly support the `set_hw_resource_1` packet. The change adds firmware version checks before calling `mes_v11_0_set_hw_resources_1()` and `mes_v12_0_set_hw_resources_1()`.
  2. **Functionality/compatibility issue**: The problem being fixed is that some older MES firmware versions do not properly support this packet, which would cause initialization failures. This is a compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - For MES v11: Only calls `set_hw_resources_1` if firmware version >= 0x50
     - For MES v12: Only calls `set_hw_resources_1` if firmware version >= 0x4b
     - These are simple version checks to prevent calling unsupported firmware functions
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond normal initialization failure
     - Any other security-relevant impact
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: The referenced similar commits show various MES initialization and configuration changes that were also not assigned CVEs, as they address functional issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit simply prevents calling a firmware function on versions that don't support it properly, which is a standard compatibility fix rather than a security vulnerability remediation.
6847b3b6e84ef drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The code changes fix two security vulnerabilities:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference**: The code adds a check for `!edid` before accessing `edid->extensions`. Without this check, if `drm_edid_raw()` returns NULL, the kernel would crash (Oops) when dereferencing the NULL pointer.
  2. **Buffer overflow**: The code adds bounds checking `edid->extensions >= sizeof(sink->dc_edid.raw_edid) / EDID_LENGTH`. Without this check, if a malicious EDID device reports too many extensions (≥16), the calculation `EDID_LENGTH * (edid->extensions + 1)` would exceed the 2048-byte `raw_edid` buffer, causing memory corruption during the `memmove()` operation.
  The commit message explicitly states these issues can be triggered by connecting "a bad adapter", making this exploitable via malicious hardware. This is similar to the CVE-assigned commits in the reference list that fixed EDID-related buffer overflows and information leaks.
2f73c62d4e13d Revert "riscv: misaligned: fix sleeping function called during misaligned access handling"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **No security vulnerability is introduced**: The revert changes from `copy_{to,from}_user_nofault()` back to `copy_{to,from}_user()`. Both functions properly check user access permissions via `access_ok()`, unlike the original vulnerable `raw_copy_{to,from}_user()` functions.
  2. **The original security fix remains intact**: The critical security fix from commit b686ecdeacf6 that prevented userspace from accessing kernel memory is NOT being reverted. That fix changed from `raw_copy_{to,from}_user()` to `copy_{to,from}_user()`, which remains in place.
  3. **This is a functionality fix, not a security fix**: The commit being reverted (61a74ad25462) was an incorrect attempt to fix a "sleeping in atomic context" warning. Using `_nofault` variants would cause legitimate user memory accesses to fail if the memory was paged out. The proper fix (453805f0a28f) that enables IRQs is already in place.
  4. **Similar to the "NO CVE" examples**: Like the memory leak fix and hotplug callback setup fixes in the reference commits, this addresses a functional issue (proper page fault handling) rather than a security vulnerability.
  The revert simply corrects an improper fix while maintaining all security boundaries established by the original security patch.
890ba5be6335d Revert "riscv: Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for __access_ok()"
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The reverted commit introduced a security vulnerability by changing TASK_SIZE_MAX to LONG_MAX, which made the access_ok() check too permissive.
  Specifically:
  1. **Memory access control bypass**: With TASK_SIZE_MAX = LONG_MAX, access_ok() would incorrectly allow addresses between TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX to pass validation
  2. **Exploitable through get_user_pages_fast()**: As noted in the commit message, get_user_pages_fast() would accept these invalid addresses, allowing userspace to potentially pin and access memory beyond its allowed range
  3. **Practical attack vector**: The vulnerability could be exploited through syscalls like futex() that use get_user_pages_fast()
  The security impact is similar to the referenced commits with CVE status YES:
  - Like commit 5 (CVE-2024-53093) which fixed unauthorized kernel memory access through raw_copy_from_user
  - Like commits 1 and 2 which fixed TASK_SIZE issues allowing userspace to access kernel memory on NOMMU systems
  This represents a clear boundary violation where userspace could potentially access restricted memory regions, warranting CVE assignment.
df831e9773940 lib/group_cpus: fix NULL pointer dereference from group_cpus_evenly()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The bug causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference when `numgrps` is 0, leading to a kernel panic. When `kcalloc(0, ...)` is called, it returns `ZERO_SIZE_PTR` (0x10), which when dereferenced causes a kernel crash at address 0x0000000000000010.
  2. **Triggerable by unprivileged users**: The crash can be triggered through configfs by writing "0" to poll_queues in null_blk, which is accessible to users with appropriate permissions to configure block devices. This makes it a potential local denial of service vulnerability.
  3. **Clear security impact**: The kernel panic results in a system crash, causing denial of service. The stack trace shows the crash happens in `__bitmap_or` when trying to dereference the ZERO_SIZE_PTR returned from `kcalloc(0, ...)`.
  4. **Similar to other CVE-assigned commits**: The commit follows patterns similar to the reference CVE commits that fix NULL pointer dereferences, particularly the null_blk examples which also involve race conditions or improper input validation leading to NULL pointer dereferences.
  5. **The fix validates input**: The patch adds a check `if (numgrps == 0) return NULL;` at the beginning of both the SMP and non-SMP versions of `group_cpus_evenly()`, preventing the vulnerable code path from being executed.
  The vulnerability allows local users to crash the system by manipulating block device configuration parameters, making it a legitimate security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
4a5e85f4eb8fd fs/proc/task_mmu: fix PAGE_IS_PFNZERO detection for the huge zero folio
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes an incorrect page categorization issue where huge zero pages are reported as PAGE_IS_PRESENT instead of PAGE_IS_PFNZERO through the PAGEMAP_SCAN ioctl. The change simply replaces `is_zero_pfn(pmd_pfn(pmd))` with `is_huge_zero_pmd(pmd)` to correctly detect huge zero folios.
  This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It only affects metadata returned to userspace (page categorization flags)
  2. No sensitive data is exposed - just incorrect page type information
  3. No potential for crashes, memory corruption, or privilege escalation
  4. Similar to other non-CVE commits (1, 2, 5) that fixed incorrect flag reporting
  5. Unlike CVE-assigned commits (3, 4) which involved race conditions, BUG_ON() triggers, and potential memory corruption
  The bug only causes userspace to receive incorrect page categorization metadata through /proc/pid/pagemap, which has no security implications.
e1d7727b73a1f io_uring: don't assume uaddr alignment in io_vec_fill_bvec
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Memory Safety Violation**: The bug is an incorrect offset calculation when user buffer addresses are not page-aligned. While the old code calculated `offset = buf_addr - folio_addr` (where `folio_addr` was page-aligned), this doesn't lead to out-of-bounds memory access because:
     - The function already validates that `buf_addr` is within the valid range via `validate_fixed_range()`
     - The calculated offset is used to index into `imu->bvec`, but the bounds are still enforced by the loop conditions
     - The incorrect offset would map to the wrong location within the *already validated* buffer range
  2. **No Security Boundary Crossing**: The bug doesn't allow:
     - Access to memory outside the registered buffer region
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure from kernel memory
     - Denial of service conditions
  3. **Functional Bug, Not Security Bug**: This is a correctness issue where:
     - The wrong offset calculation could cause I/O operations to read/write from incorrect locations *within* the already-registered buffer
     - This could cause data corruption within the user's own buffer space
     - But it cannot access memory outside the bounds already validated
  4. **Validation Still Enforced**: The critical security check `validate_fixed_range()` is still called and enforced, ensuring that all addresses are within the registered buffer bounds.
  While this bug could cause incorrect behavior and data corruption within a user's own buffers, it does not cross security boundaries or allow unauthorized memory access, making it a functional bug rather than a security vulnerability requiring a CVE.
3a3c6d61577db io_uring/rsrc: don't rely on user vaddr alignment
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes an incorrect offset calculation when coalescing multi-hugepage buffers in io_uring, but it does not represent a security vulnerability. The bug causes functional incorrectness in buffer offset calculations but does not lead to:
  1. **Memory safety violations** - All accesses remain within registered buffer bounds due to existing validation
  2. **Information disclosure** - No unauthorized memory access is possible
  3. **Privilege escalation** - No security boundaries are crossed
  The incorrect calculation `off = (unsigned long) iov->iov_base & ((1UL << imu->folio_shift) - 1)` assumed user virtual addresses align with folio boundaries, which isn't guaranteed. The fix properly calculates the offset by first getting the page offset and then adding the page index within the folio.
  This is a correctness issue that could cause data corruption within the user's own registered buffers under specific conditions (multi-hugepage coalescing with certain alignments), but it doesn't violate any security boundaries or enable attacks.
5afb4bf9fc62d io_uring/rsrc: fix folio unpinning
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, I need to determine whether this should be assigned a CVE.
  **Analysis:**
  1. **The bug**: The commit fixes a critical issue where io_uring was incorrectly unpinning pages. When pinning tail pages of a folio, the code would later try to unpin the head page, causing a kernel BUG assertion failure in mm/gup.c.
  2. **The fix**: The commit changes from using `unpin_user_page()` to `unpin_user_folio()` to properly handle folio unpinning, ensuring the correct page reference is released.
  3. **Security implications**:
     - The bug triggers a kernel BUG assertion (`kernel BUG at mm/gup.c:71!`), causing a kernel panic/crash
     - This is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that can be triggered by unprivileged users through io_uring operations
     - The bug allows local users to crash the system by registering buffers with io_uring that span multi-page folios
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar commits #1-5 all dealt with page reference counting issues and were assigned CVEs
     - They fixed crashes, memory management issues, and incorrect page handling
     - This commit has similar characteristics: fixing incorrect page/folio handling that leads to kernel crashes
  **Answer: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE because:
  1. It fixes a denial of service vulnerability where local users can trigger a kernel panic through io_uring buffer registration
  2. The bug allows unprivileged users to crash the system by registering buffers that span across folio boundaries
  3. The issue is similar in nature to other page reference counting bugs that have been assigned CVEs (like the similar commits shown)
  4. The commit message explicitly shows a kernel BUG/crash trace, indicating a security-relevant denial of service condition
  5. The issue affects system availability and can be triggered by userspace operations
7360ee47599af s390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, this commit should be assigned a **YES** for CVE.
  Here's the reasoning:
  1. **Integer Overflow Vulnerability**: The original code in `_copy_apqns_from_user()` performs a multiplication (`nr_apqns * sizeof(struct pkey_apqn)`) without checking for overflow. Since `nr_apqns` comes directly from userspace via ioctl calls, an attacker could provide a large value that causes the multiplication to overflow.
  2. **Security Impact**: When the overflow occurs:
     - The `nbytes` calculation results in a smaller value than intended
     - `kmalloc()` allocates less memory than needed
     - `copy_from_user()` then copies more data than allocated, leading to a heap buffer overflow
  3. **Exploitability**: This vulnerability is exploitable from userspace through multiple ioctl interfaces:
     - `PKEY_GENSECK2`
     - `PKEY_CLR2SECK2`
     - `PKEY_KBLOB2PROTK2`
     - And other ioctls that use `_copy_apqns_from_user()`
  4. **Fix**: The commit replaces `memdup_user()` with `memdup_array_user()`, which includes built-in overflow checking via `check_mul_overflow()`. This properly validates the multiplication before allocation.
  5. **Similar to Previous CVEs**: This follows the pattern of Similar Commits 2, 4, and 5, which all received CVEs for integer overflow vulnerabilities in size calculations, particularly when dealing with user-controlled values.
  The vulnerability allows unprivileged users to potentially corrupt kernel memory through heap overflow, which could lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.
c5136add3f9b4 riscv: export boot_cpu_hartid
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel tree context:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit simply exports the `boot_cpu_hartid` variable as `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL` to fix a build issue where the Microchip IPC mailbox driver cannot be built as a module on non-SMP kernels. Here's why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Not a security fix**: The commit fixes a build/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability. It enables module building in specific configurations.
  2. **No sensitive information exposed**: The `boot_cpu_hartid` is just a hardware identifier (hart ID) of the boot CPU, similar to CPU topology information already available through `/proc/cpuinfo`.
  3. **GPL-only export**: The use of `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL` (not `EXPORT_SYMBOL`) restricts access to GPL-licensed modules only, providing adequate access control.
  4. **Required for legitimate functionality**: The export is necessary for the mailbox driver to work correctly on non-SMP systems, where `cpuid_to_hartid_map()` returns `boot_cpu_hartid`.
  5. **No security impact**: The hart ID is architectural information used for CPU identification and interrupt routing. It doesn't grant any privileges or expose security-sensitive data.
  The commit is a simple functional fix that enables proper module building without introducing any security vulnerabilities or risks.
bf39286adc5e1 ASoC: amd: yc: Add DMI quirk for Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 15
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit adds a DMI quirk entry to enable microphone support on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 15 laptop. It's a hardware enablement patch that adds a device identification entry to the `yc_acp_quirk_table`. The change only enables existing functionality for a specific hardware model and does not fix any security vulnerability, memory safety issue, race condition, or access control problem.
4262bd0d9cc70 riscv: vector: Fix context save/restore with xtheadvector
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the bug. Let me write the analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a critical bug in the RISC-V vector context save/restore implementation for T-Head vector extension (xtheadvector). 
  The bug analysis:
  1. **Security Impact**: The bug causes corruption of userspace vector register state (v8-v31) during context switches. When the kernel saves/restores vector context for the xtheadvector implementation, it incorrectly uses `THEAD_VSB_V_V0T0` for all save operations instead of using the appropriate macros for different register groups (V8, V16, V24).
  2. **Code Analysis**: 
     - The original buggy code used `THEAD_VSB_V_V0T0` four times, which only saves v0-v7 repeatedly
     - The fix correctly uses `THEAD_VSB_V_V0T0`, `THEAD_VSB_V_V8T0`, `THEAD_VSB_V_V16T0`, and `THEAD_VSB_V_V24T0` to save all 32 vector registers
     - The same issue existed in the restore path with `THEAD_VLB_V_V0T0`
  3. **Exploitation Potential**: This vulnerability could lead to:
     - Information disclosure: One process could potentially read vector register contents from another process
     - Data corruption: Vector computations in userspace would produce incorrect results due to corrupted register state
     - Potential privilege escalation: If sensitive data or cryptographic keys are stored in vector registers
  4. **Affected Systems**: Any RISC-V system using T-Head cores with vector extension (xtheadvector) would be vulnerable when running kernels with the buggy implementation.
  The commit message explicitly states this breaks userspace and damages the context of v8-v31 registers, confirming the security-relevant nature of this fix.
ff8abbd248c1f smb: client: fix regression with native SMB symlinks
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of the changes. Let me analyze this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's the analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional regression fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit message clearly states it's fixing a regression where backup/copy tools fail when encountering unparseable symlink targets.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The issue causes legitimate operations (lstat(2) and readlink(2)) to fail when encountering certain NT-style symlinks that the client cannot parse. This is a functionality issue that breaks user tools, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Code changes**: The changes replace error returns (-EIO) with a fallback behavior (goto out_unhandled_target) that allows the operation to succeed even when the symlink target cannot be fully parsed. This restores compatibility without introducing security risks.
  4. **Security implications**: There are no security boundaries being violated, no privilege escalation, no memory corruption, no information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issues. The change simply allows unparseable symlinks to be handled gracefully rather than causing errors.
  5. **Similar commits context**: The similar commits shown (improving symlink creation, handling reparse points, etc.) were also marked as "CVE Status: NO" because they are feature improvements or compatibility fixes rather than security fixes.
  The commit is fixing a regression introduced by commit 12b466eb52d9 that was too strict in handling NT-style symlinks, causing legitimate tools to fail. This is a user experience and compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
4f489fe6afb39 mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a memory leak vulnerability where repeated writes to the `memcg_path` sysfs file would allocate new memory without freeing the previously allocated buffer. While the file requires root privileges (mode 0600), this is still a security vulnerability that can lead to kernel memory exhaustion and system denial of service. The pattern matches similar memory management issues in the DAMON subsystem that have been assigned CVEs (commits 2, 3, and 5 in the reference list).
e97f9540ce001 smb: client: remove \t from TP_printk statements
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Non-security issue**: The change only removes tab characters (`\t`) from trace print format strings. This is purely a formatting/display issue that causes trace-cmd to show "[FAILED TO PARSE]" messages.
  2. **No security impact**: 
     - The code changes only affect how trace output is formatted for display
     - No memory corruption, buffer overflows, or access control issues
     - No privilege escalation or information disclosure vulnerabilities
     - The trace data itself remains intact; only the formatting for human-readable output is affected
  3. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar historical commits provided, none of the tracepoint formatting fixes received CVEs. They are all treated as regular bug fixes.
  4. **Functionality impact only**: The commit message clearly states this is about trace-cmd displaying "[FAILED TO PARSE]" - this is a tool parsing/display issue, not a kernel security vulnerability.
  5. **Code analysis**: The changes are trivial string formatting modifications - removing `\t` from the beginning of TP_printk format strings. This cannot introduce any security vulnerabilities.
  While this is marked for stable (Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org), that's because it's a bug that affects functionality across kernel versions, not because it's a security issue.
3e0809b1664b9 ata: ahci: Use correct DMI identifier for ASUSPRO-D840SA LPM quirk
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is fixing a bug in a previous quirk implementation where the wrong DMI field was used (DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION instead of DMI_PRODUCT_NAME). The original quirk was intended to disable Link Power Management (LPM) on ASUSPRO-D840SA motherboards to avoid graphical corruptions, but it wasn't being applied because of the incorrect DMI field.
  2. **Functional issue only**: The code change simply corrects which DMI field is checked - changing from `DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION, "ASUSPRO D840MB_M840SA")` to `DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "ASUSPRO D840MB_M840SA")`. This makes the quirk actually work as intended.
  3. **No security impact**: The issue being addressed is graphical corruption when LPM is enabled on specific hardware. This is a quality/compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability. The worst case scenario is visual artifacts on the screen, not any security compromise.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they all involve DMI matching fixes or additions for hardware quirks. None of these were assigned CVEs because they address hardware compatibility issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
  5. **Code pattern**: The change follows the same pattern as other non-CVE DMI fixes - it's simply correcting which DMI field to match against to properly identify the affected hardware.
  The commit is a simple one-line fix to make an existing hardware quirk work properly by using the correct DMI identifier field.
79300ac805b67 scripts/gdb: fix dentry_name() lookup
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit is a simple fix for a GDB debugging script that was broken due to an internal kernel structure change. It does not fix a security vulnerability for the following reasons:
  1. **Tool-only change**: The change is in `/scripts/gdb/linux/vfs.py`, which is a GDB helper script used for kernel debugging, not kernel runtime code.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue was that the GDB script couldn't properly display mount information due to the structure member name change (`d_iname` → `d_shortname.string`). This only affected developers debugging the kernel with GDB.
  3. **Compatibility fix**: This is purely a compatibility update to align the debugging script with the kernel's internal structure change from commit 58cf9c383c5c.
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the first two reference commits which also fixed GDB script issues and were marked as "CVE Status: NO".
  The error "There is no member named d_iname" was a debugging inconvenience, not a security vulnerability that could be exploited in any way.
befd9a71d859e fuse: fix runtime warning on truncate_folio_batch_exceptionals()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a runtime warning fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit addresses a WARN_ON_ONCE() that was introduced in commit bde708f1a65d to detect when filesystems haven't properly cleaned up DAX entries before truncation.
  2. **Impact analysis**: The issue only causes a runtime warning (kernel log noise) but does not lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation  
     - Data corruption
     - System crashes (beyond the warning itself)
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
  3. **Code changes**: The fix simply adds a call to `dax_break_layout_final(inode)` in fuse's `fuse_evict_inode()` function before calling `truncate_inode_pages_final()`. This ensures DAX entries are properly cleaned up before truncation, preventing the warning.
  4. **Similar commits pattern**: The commit message explicitly states this fix was already applied to XFS and ext4 in commit 0e2f80afcfa6. This indicates it's a systematic fix across filesystems to comply with the new DAX interface requirements, not a security issue.
  5. **Warning purpose**: The WARN_ON_ONCE in `truncate_folio_batch_exceptionals()` was added as a debugging aid to catch filesystems that haven't been updated to the new DAX cleanup protocol. It's a development/debugging mechanism, not a security boundary check.
  The commit is a functional fix to eliminate a harmless warning, not a security vulnerability fix.
45515c643d0ab LoongArch: KVM: Check interrupt route from physical CPU
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, I need to provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit fixes an incorrect API usage where `kvm_get_vcpu()` was being used with physical CPU IDs instead of logical vCPU indices. The fix changes to use `kvm_get_vcpu_by_cpuid()` which correctly handles physical CPU IDs.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The issue occurs within the KVM virtualization subsystem where a hypervisor manages virtual CPUs. This is an internal KVM implementation detail that doesn't cross security boundaries.
  3. **Limited impact**: Looking at the code changes, the main consequences are:
     - In `eiointc_update_irq()`: If `kvm_get_vcpu()` returns NULL due to invalid mapping, the code would crash when dereferencing `vcpu` at line 71 (`kvm_vcpu_ioctl_interrupt(vcpu, &vcpu_irq)`). However, this only affects the specific VM instance.
     - In `eiointc_set_sw_coreisr()`: Line 30 uses `cpu` as an array index (`s->coreisr.reg_u32[cpu][irq_index]`), but `cpu` comes from `vcpu->vcpu_id` which is bounded.
  4. **No privilege escalation or information disclosure**: The bug doesn't allow:
     - Guest-to-host escape
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure between VMs
     - Denial of service beyond the affected VM
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 3 and 4 (both CVE Status: YES) involved NULL pointer dereferences that could be triggered by userspace through ioctl interfaces, potentially causing host kernel crashes
     - This commit's issue is more contained within the interrupt routing logic and doesn't have the same external triggering mechanism
  The fix is important for correctness and stability of the EIOINTC interrupt controller emulation, but it doesn't meet the threshold for a CVE assignment as it doesn't represent a security vulnerability with meaningful security impact.
c34bbc2c99070 LoongArch: KVM: Fix interrupt route update with EIOINTC
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not require a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Type safety issue, not a security vulnerability**: The fix addresses a type safety issue where a pointer to different sized data types (u8, u16, u32, u64) was being cast to `u64 *` and dereferenced. This could cause incorrect value interpretation but doesn't create an exploitable security vulnerability.
  2. **No memory corruption or overflow**: The issue is about incorrect type casting leading to reading incorrect values when `pvalue` points to data smaller than 64 bits. The function would read beyond the intended data size, but this occurs within the kernel's controlled memory space, not leading to memory corruption that could be exploited.
  3. **Limited impact**: The incorrect value would only affect interrupt routing configurations in the LoongArch KVM EIOINTC (Extended I/O Interrupt Controller). While this could cause functional issues with interrupt delivery, it doesn't provide a privilege escalation path or allow guest-to-host escape.
  4. **KVM context**: This is within KVM virtualization code where the guest's interrupt controller state is being managed. The misread values would only affect the guest's interrupt routing, not compromise host security.
  5. **Similar to historical non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, they show various KVM fixes for functional issues that weren't assigned CVEs, including typo fixes, parameter additions, and routing logic fixes.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix for a programming error that could cause incorrect behavior, but it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
9159c5e733cfa LoongArch: KVM: Add address alignment check for IOCSR emulation
- [sasha] Now I understand the security vulnerability. Looking at the code:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds address alignment checks for IOCSR (I/O Control and Status Register) emulation in the EIOINTC (Extended I/O Interrupt Controller) component of LoongArch KVM.
  2. **Impact analysis**: 
     - The added checks (lines 319-322 and 684-687) validate that `addr & (len - 1) == 0`, ensuring addresses are naturally aligned with their access size
     - Without these checks, misaligned accesses would still be processed by the read/write functions
     - The index calculations (e.g., `index = (offset - EIOINTC_NODETYPE_START) >> 1` for 16-bit reads) would produce incorrect results for misaligned addresses
     - However, this would only result in reading/writing to incorrect register offsets within the already bounded register arrays
  3. **Security implications**:
     - The register arrays are already bounded by their defined sizes (e.g., `reg_u16[EIOINTC_IRQS_U16_NUMS]`)
     - The switch statements already limit which register ranges can be accessed
     - Misaligned addresses would cause functional incorrectness but not memory corruption or out-of-bounds access
     - The issue is limited to guests and cannot escape the VM boundary
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: The CVE-assigned commit in the examples (shift-out-of-bounds bug) involved an actual integer overflow that could cause undefined behavior. This alignment issue is more of a functional correctness problem.
  This is a bug fix for proper hardware emulation behavior, not a security vulnerability fix.
955853cf83657 LoongArch: KVM: Disable updating of "num_cpu" and "feature"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit prevents modification of read-only properties (`num_cpu` and `features`) after device creation, but the original behavior did not constitute a security vulnerability.
  2. **No exploitable security impact**: While the commit mentions these properties should be "read-only once eiointc is created", allowing writes to these fields after creation doesn't directly lead to:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation  
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
  3. **Bounds checking already exists**: Looking at line 884 in `kvm_eiointc_regs_access()`, there's already a bounds check:
     ```c
     if (cpu >= s->num_cpu)
         return -EINVAL;
     ```
     This prevents out-of-bounds access to the `coreisr` array even if `num_cpu` is modified.
  4. **Limited exposure**: The issue only affects KVM guest device configuration through specific ioctl interfaces, requiring appropriate permissions to access KVM devices.
  5. **Design issue rather than vulnerability**: This is more of a design/API correctness issue where certain properties should be immutable after initialization, rather than a security vulnerability that could be exploited for malicious purposes.
  The commit improves the robustness of the code by enforcing the intended read-only behavior, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
cc8d5b209e09d LoongArch: KVM: Check validity of "num_cpu" from user space
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I need to make a determination. Let me create a summary of what I found:
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a security vulnerability that allows an array overflow from userspace input. Here's why this deserves a CVE:
  1. **User-controllable input**: The vulnerability occurs in `kvm_eiointc_regs_access()` where userspace can control the `cpu` value through the `attr->attr` parameter (extracted as `cpu = addr >> 16`).
  2. **Missing bounds check**: In the original code, when accessing `s->coreisr.reg_u32[cpuid][offset]`, there was no validation that `cpuid` is less than the array size (`EIOINTC_ROUTE_MAX_VCPUS` = 256).
  3. **Array overflow**: Without bounds checking, a malicious userspace program could provide a `cpu` value >= 256, causing an out-of-bounds array access when accessing `s->coreisr.reg_u32[cpu][offset]`.
  4. **Security impact**: This could lead to:
     - Memory corruption by writing to arbitrary kernel memory locations
     - Information disclosure by reading from arbitrary kernel memory
     - Potential privilege escalation or kernel crash
  5. **Attack surface**: The vulnerable code is reachable through KVM device ioctls (`KVM_DEV_LOONGARCH_EXTIOI_GRP_REGS`), which are accessible to unprivileged users who have access to create VMs.
  The fix properly validates both code paths:
  - In `kvm_eiointc_ctrl_access()`: validates that `val < EIOINTC_ROUTE_MAX_VCPUS` before assigning to `s->num_cpu`
  - In `kvm_eiointc_regs_access()`: validates that `cpu >= s->num_cpu` before array access
  This is a classic input validation vulnerability with clear security implications.
080e8d2ecdfde LoongArch: KVM: Avoid overflow with array index
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The vulnerability involves multiple array index overflow issues in the LoongArch KVM EIOINTC implementation:
  1. **Type confusion bug**: The code uses `s->enable.reg_u32[index]` where `index` is calculated for u16 arrays (shifted by 1), causing out-of-bounds reads.
  2. **Index modification bug**: The code modifies `index` in-place (`index = index << 1/2/3`) and then incorrectly reuses it to access `s->enable.reg_u16[index]` arrays, leading to wrong memory accesses.
  3. **Missing array indexing**: In the disable IRQ path, the code uses `index` instead of `index + i`, causing all operations to target the wrong array element.
  These bugs allow a malicious guest to trigger out-of-bounds array accesses through MMIO writes to EIOINTC_ENABLE registers, potentially leading to:
  - Information disclosure (reading beyond array bounds)
  - Memory corruption (writing to wrong indices)
  - Violation of VM isolation boundaries
  This is a classic guest-to-host security vulnerability in KVM that warrants CVE assignment.
56ad91c1aa9c1 i2c: robotfuzz-osif: disable zero-length read messages
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The change addresses a USB protocol compliance issue, not a security vulnerability. The driver was passing zero-length read requests directly to `usb_control_msg()`, which violates USB specifications and triggers warnings. However, this doesn't create any exploitable security conditions:
  1. **No memory corruption**: The zero-length parameter doesn't cause buffer overflows or underflows
  2. **No crashes**: The USB subsystem handles the invalid request safely with only a warning
  3. **No data exposure**: No sensitive information is leaked
  4. **Protocol compliance only**: This is purely about following USB specifications correctly
  The fix simply adds the `I2C_AQ_NO_ZERO_LEN_READ` quirk flag to prevent zero-length read messages from being accepted by the I2C adapter, avoiding the protocol violation entirely. This is a quality improvement, not a security fix.
cbdb25ccf7566 i2c: tiny-usb: disable zero-length read messages
- [sasha] Now, based on all the information gathered, let me analyze this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: The commit prevents a USB protocol violation, not a security vulnerability. When zero-length read messages are passed, they violate USB protocol specifications and trigger warnings, but don't cause:
     - Memory corruption
     - Buffer overflows  
     - Information disclosure
     - Privilege escalation
     - System crashes
     - Any exploitable condition
  2. **Preventive Measure**: The change adds the `I2C_AQ_NO_ZERO_LEN_READ` quirk which makes the I2C core layer reject zero-length read requests with `-EOPNOTSUPP` before they reach the USB layer. This is a validation improvement, not a security fix.
  3. **Limited Impact**: The issue only causes protocol warnings to be printed. The commit message explicitly states "it violates the USB protocol and a warning will be printed" - not that it causes any security issues.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This is very similar to the first example commit about i2c-microchip-corei2c "ghost" detections, which was marked as "CVE Status: NO". Both fix protocol/specification violations without security implications.
  5. **Unlike CVE-Assigned Commits**: The CVE-assigned examples show clear security issues:
     - "usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit" - prevents integer underflow and potential oops
     - "usb: gadget: ncm: Fix handling of zero block length packets" - prevents infinite loop and crash
     - "usb: gadget: configfs: Prevent OOB read/write" - prevents out-of-bounds memory access
  This commit is a robustness improvement that ensures proper USB protocol compliance, but does not fix any security vulnerability.
a5d0b9e327452 i2c: imx: fix emulated smbus block read
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This fix addresses a functional bug in the i.MX I2C driver's SMBus block read implementation, not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: The issue is that the driver fails to properly acknowledge the first byte (block length) during SMBus block reads, causing the target device to not send subsequent data bytes. This results in reading 0xff values instead of actual data.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The bug does not:
     - Allow reading beyond allocated buffers
     - Enable privilege escalation
     - Expose sensitive information
     - Create memory corruption
     - Allow unauthorized access
  3. **Functional failure only**: The commit message clearly describes this as a communication protocol issue where:
     - The driver doesn't send the required ACK after reading the block length byte
     - Without the ACK, SMBus devices stop transmitting and the controller reads 0xff
     - The first data byte was incorrectly interpreted as the length
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - Similar Commit 1 (CVE: YES) - Fixed an integer overflow that could lead to buffer overruns
     - Similar Commit 2 (CVE: YES) - Fixed incorrect buffer index handling in block process calls
     - This commit merely fixes protocol compliance for proper data transmission
  5. **Code changes**: The fix adds:
     - Proper ACK generation for block reads (`I2C_M_RECV_LEN` flag check)
     - Correct storage of the block length in the buffer
  This is a straightforward protocol compliance fix that ensures SMBus block reads work correctly, without any security implications.
666c23af755dc i2c: omap: Fix an error handling path in omap_i2c_probe()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a resource leak in error handling where `mux_state_deselect()` is not called after a successful `mux_state_select()`. However, this should not be assigned a CVE because:
  1. **Minimal Security Impact**: The mux state is a hardware multiplexer configuration resource managed by the devm (device-managed) framework, meaning it would be automatically cleaned up when the device is removed regardless.
  2. **No Exploitability**: This is a local driver initialization issue with no remote attack vector. The leak only occurs during failed probe attempts.
  3. **Pattern Matching**: The three similar commits marked "NO CVE" (ali15x3, ali1535, sis630) all fix similar resource cleanup issues with `request_region()`/`release_region()` pairs. This commit follows the same pattern but with mux states.
  4. **Resource Type**: Unlike the commit marked "YES CVE" which dealt with `ioremap()` memory mappings that could potentially expose kernel memory or exhaust virtual address space, mux states are simple hardware configuration resources with no security implications.
  The fix is correct and improves code quality, but the security impact is negligible, making it inappropriate for CVE assignment.
32ca245464e14 af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE. The commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in AF_UNIX socket OOB data handling that can be triggered by unprivileged local users. The vulnerability occurs when multiple OOB messages are received consecutively, leaving consumed OOB skbs in the receive queue. Due to improper handling of these zero-length skbs in the SO_PEEK_OFF code path, a subsequent normal recv() can incorrectly access and free an OOB skb, leading to use-after-free when the OOB data is later accessed with recv(MSG_OOB).
  The security impact is significant as use-after-free vulnerabilities typically enable memory corruption and potential privilege escalation. The commit message explicitly mentions the KASAN use-after-free report, and similar AF_UNIX OOB handling bugs have been assigned CVEs in the past.
f4c7baa0699b6 drm/i915/display: Add check for alloc_ordered_workqueue() and alloc_workqueue()
- [sasha] Let me look at the similar commits again to understand the pattern better:
  Based on my analysis of the commit and the similar commits provided, here is my determination:
  **YES**, this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Missing NULL Check Leading to NULL Pointer Dereference**: The commit adds checks for the return values of `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` and `alloc_workqueue()`. Without these checks, if the allocation fails (returns NULL), the code would continue execution with NULL workqueue pointers.
  2. **Exploitable Crash Scenario**: When these NULL workqueue pointers are later used (e.g., in `queue_work(display->wq.cleanup, &state->cleanup_work)` at line 7479 in intel_display.c), it would cause a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a kernel crash.
  3. **Similar CVE Precedents**: All 5 similar commits provided were assigned CVEs for the exact same issue pattern:
     - Missing NULL checks after `alloc_ordered_workqueue()` or `alloc_workqueue()` calls
     - All fixed potential NULL pointer dereferences
     - All were marked for stable backporting
  4. **Security Impact**: The vulnerability could be triggered under memory pressure conditions where workqueue allocation might fail, potentially allowing:
     - Local denial of service through kernel panic
     - Possible privilege escalation if the crash can be controlled
  5. **Code Pattern Match**: The fix follows the exact same pattern as the CVE-assigned commits:
     ```c
     display->wq.modeset = alloc_ordered_workqueue("i915_modeset", 0);
     + if (!display->wq.modeset) {
     +     ret = -ENOMEM;
     +     goto cleanup_vga_client_pw_domain_dmc;
     + }
     ```
  The commit also properly handles cleanup to prevent memory leaks by adding appropriate cleanup labels and `destroy_workqueue()` calls in the error path, which is consistent with the security fixes in the similar commits.
0ec33c81d9c73 io_uring/zcrx: fix area release on registration failure
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me trace through the code flow:
  1. In `io_register_zcrx_ifq`, when `io_zcrx_create_area` is called at line 596, if it fails at any point before line 436 (where `area->ifq = ifq` is set), the area is allocated but `area->ifq` remains NULL.
  2. When `io_zcrx_create_area` fails, it jumps to the `err` label which calls `io_zcrx_free_area(area)`.
  3. Before this fix, `io_zcrx_free_area` would unconditionally call `io_zcrx_unmap_area(area->ifq, area)`, which would dereference a NULL `area->ifq` pointer.
  4. Looking at `io_zcrx_unmap_area`, it immediately tries to acquire a mutex with `guard(mutex)(&ifq->dma_lock)`, which would crash if `ifq` is NULL.
  This is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability that can be triggered during area registration failure. The fix adds a NULL check before calling `io_zcrx_unmap_area`.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. While it fixes a NULL pointer dereference, this occurs only during the registration failure path of io_uring zero-copy receive functionality. The vulnerability:
  1. Cannot be exploited for privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution
  2. Only causes a kernel crash/DoS in a specific error handling path
  3. Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to trigger (as seen in io_register_zcrx_ifq)
  4. Is in a relatively new, specialized feature (zero-copy receive)
  5. Only affects error paths during setup, not normal operation
  Similar to the "io_uring: clean rings on NO_MMAP alloc fail" commit which was marked NO, this is a defensive fix for an error handling path that improves robustness but doesn't address a security vulnerability with meaningful impact.
782dfa329ac9d io_uring/zcrx: split out memory holders from area
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit is a pure refactoring that splits memory-related fields from `struct io_zcrx_area` into a new `struct io_zcrx_mem`. The changes are:
  1. **Structural refactoring**: The commit moves `pages` and `nr_folios` fields from `io_zcrx_area` into a new nested structure `io_zcrx_mem`, along with adding a `size` field.
  2. **Code reorganization**: It extracts the memory import logic into a separate `io_import_area()` function and adds a corresponding `io_release_area_mem()` function for cleanup.
  3. **No security fixes**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerabilities. The validation logic remains the same:
     - `io_validate_user_buf_range()` check
     - Address alignment checks (`addr & ~PAGE_MASK`)
     - Null address check
     - The same `io_pin_pages()` call
  4. **No behavior changes**: All the security-relevant checks and operations remain identical, just reorganized into different functions. The DMA mapping, page pinning, and cleanup logic are functionally unchanged.
  5. **Pure code improvement**: As stated in the commit message, this is about logical separation of concerns - keeping memory-type-specific code separate from generic area management, which is a clean code practice but not a security fix.
  This is similar to the reference commits with "CVE Status: NO" that also performed code reorganization and refactoring without fixing security issues (like "io_uring: unify io_pin_pages()" and "io_uring: add ring freeing helper").
d760d3f59f0d8 io_uring/zcrx: improve area validation
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the commit in detail. The commit changes the area validation function for io_uring's zero-copy receive (zcrx) feature. Let me examine the key changes:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's the analysis:
  ## Code Changes Analysis:
  1. **New validation function introduced**: The commit introduces `io_validate_user_buf_range()` as a more flexible validation function that:
     - Takes u64 parameters directly (uaddr, ulen) instead of an iovec structure
     - Performs the same security checks as before (size limits, overflow check)
     - Returns the same error codes
  2. **Previous validation preserved**: The old `io_buffer_validate()` function is modified to call the new function internally, maintaining backward compatibility and the same validation logic.
  3. **Purpose is feature enablement**: The commit message clearly states this is to support "dmabuf backed area" which will take offsets instead of addresses. This is a feature enhancement to support different memory backing types.
  ## Security Analysis:
  - **No security issue fixed**: The commit doesn't fix any existing vulnerability - it refactors validation code to be more flexible
  - **Same validation logic**: All the original security checks remain:
    - Size limit check (> SZ_1G)
    - Zero length check
    - Overflow protection via `check_add_overflow()`
  - **No weakening of checks**: The validation logic is preserved exactly as before
  - **Type safety improvement**: Using u64 directly avoids potential truncation issues with iovec's size_t
  ## Comparison with Similar Commits:
  Unlike the CVE-assigned commits in the examples which fixed:
  - Virtual memory mapping boundary calculations (commit 3)
  - EOF check refinements (commit 4)
  - 64-bit offset truncation bugs (commit 5)
  This commit is purely a refactoring to support new functionality without fixing any existing security issue.
  The changes are architectural improvements to support future dmabuf integration in io_uring's zero-copy receive functionality, not a security fix.
a79154ae5df9e io_uring/zcrx: move io_zcrx_iov_page
- [sasha] Based on the commit message and analysis of the code:
  **NO**
  This commit is a simple code refactoring that moves the `io_zcrx_iov_page` function to a different location in the same file. The commit message clearly states this is to "keep offset calculations closer together" and that it's just moving code around.
  Key observations:
  1. The commit is purely a code organization change - no functional modifications
  2. The function `io_zcrx_iov_page` is simply being relocated within the same file
  3. No security-relevant logic is changed
  4. No access control, bounds checking, or validation changes
  5. The change appears to be from `area->pages[net_iov_idx(niov)]` to `area->mem.pages[net_iov_idx(niov)]` based on the current code, but the commit message indicates it's just a move operation
  6. This is similar to the reference commits marked as "CVE Status: NO" which were also refactoring/reorganization changes
  This is a routine code maintenance commit that improves code organization without any security implications.
a920196062328 f2fs: don't over-report free space or inodes in statvfs
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a correctness issue in quota reporting that is identical to fixes in ext4 (commit f87d3af74193) and xfs (commit 4b8d867ca6e2), both of which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" in the provided similar commits.
  The code changes replace direct assignment of quota limits with `min()` operations to prevent over-reporting of available space when project quotas are enabled. This is a functional bug that causes `statvfs` to report incorrect free space values, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability as it:
  - Does not expose memory or sensitive information
  - Does not allow privilege escalation or unauthorized access
  - Does not cause crashes or denial of service
  - Only affects the accuracy of reported filesystem statistics
  The issue is purely about incorrect resource reporting to userspace applications, which could mislead them about available space but poses no security risk.
9079db287fc3e ASoC: codecs: wcd9335: Fix missing free of regulator supplies
- [sasha] **CVE Analysis Decision: YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Memory Leak**: The original code calls `regulator_bulk_get()` to allocate regulator supplies but never frees them. When probe fails or the driver is unbound, these resources are leaked.
  2. **Resource Exhaustion**: More critically, the code calls `regulator_bulk_enable()` to enable the regulators but never calls `regulator_bulk_disable()` on error paths or during unbind. This leads to:
     - Unbalanced regulator reference counts
     - Regulators remaining enabled when they should be disabled
     - Potential power consumption issues
     - Resource exhaustion over time with repeated probe failures
  3. **Multiple Error Paths**: The issue affects multiple error paths in `wcd9335_slim_status()` function where returns happen after resources are already allocated and enabled.
  4. **Missing Remove Callback**: The `wcd9335_slim_driver` structure has no `.remove` callback, meaning resources are never cleaned up during normal driver unbind.
  5. **Security Impact**: While this is primarily a resource leak, it can lead to:
     - System instability through resource exhaustion
     - Denial of service if an attacker can trigger repeated probe/unbind cycles
     - Power management issues that could affect system behavior
  The fix correctly addresses this by using `devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()` which automatically handles both allocation and enable/disable on all error paths and during driver removal.
  This is similar to the CVE-worthy commits shown in the examples, particularly the memory leak fixes in `wcd937x` that were assigned CVEs.
d5099bc1b5641 ASoC: codec: wcd9335: Convert to GPIO descriptors
- [sasha] Now let me analyze this commit more systematically. Based on the commit message and code changes I can see:
  **NO**
  This commit is a code cleanup/modernization change that converts the WCD9335 audio codec driver from using the deprecated of_gpio.h API to the modern GPIO descriptors API. The key changes are:
  1. **API Modernization**: The driver switches from the legacy `of_get_named_gpio()` to the modern `devm_gpiod_get()` API for GPIO handling.
  2. **Polarity Handling**: The commit correctly handles GPIO polarity by using `GPIOD_OUT_LOW` when getting the GPIO and inverting the logic in `gpiod_set_value()` calls (1 for assert reset, 0 for deassert).
  3. **No Security Impact**: 
     - This is purely a code refactoring that maintains the same functionality
     - The reset GPIO behavior remains identical - it's still used to reset the codec hardware
     - No access control, privilege escalation, or memory safety issues are introduced or fixed
     - The change doesn't affect any security boundaries or expose new attack surfaces
  4. **Regulator Changes**: The commit also appears to modernize regulator handling by switching to `devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()`, which is another API improvement but not security-related.
  This type of API conversion is common in kernel development as deprecated APIs are phased out in favor of more modern, cleaner interfaces. The commit doesn't fix any security vulnerability - it's a maintenance change to keep the code using current best practices.
a70705d3c020d media: uvcvideo: Rollback non processed entities on error
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the code changes, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Boundary Violation**: The issue is a synchronization bug between cached control values and hardware state within the UVC driver. When a control commit fails for one entity, the driver continues processing other entities but fails to rollback the backup data for remaining entities. This causes the driver's internal cache to become out of sync with the hardware state.
  2. **No Exploitable Impact**: The commit message and code changes show this is a consistency issue between driver cache and device state. There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure across security boundaries
     - Denial of service beyond normal driver malfunction
  3. **Normal Driver Bug**: The bug manifests as incorrect control behavior where subsequent control operations might use stale cached values instead of actual hardware values. This is a functional bug, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Limited Scope**: The issue only affects the internal state consistency of the UVC driver when handling control failures. It doesn't cross any security boundaries or allow unauthorized access to resources.
  5. **Similar Commits Pattern**: The referenced similar commits (like "Only save async fh if success" and "Set error_idx during ctrl_commit errors") are also marked as NO for CVE assignment, indicating these types of control handling improvements are considered regular bug fixes rather than security issues.
  The fix ensures proper rollback of backup data for all entities when any entity fails to commit, maintaining cache coherency. While this improves driver reliability, it doesn't address any security vulnerability.
10acb91013554 media: uvcvideo: Increase/decrease the PM counter per IOCTL
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit implements a power management optimization for the UVC (USB Video Class) driver by changing when power management reference counts are taken and released. Here's why this is not a security vulnerability:
  1. **Feature Enhancement, Not Bug Fix**: The commit message clearly states this is an optimization to "increase the granularity" of power management. It's moving PM reference counting from device open/close to per-ioctl operations to avoid keeping the camera powered on unnecessarily.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The changes involve:
     - Adding PM reference counting around ioctl operations
     - Properly handling PM references for async controls and streaming
     - Adding cleanup code to handle edge cases where PM references might be leaked
  3. **Proper Error Handling**: The code adds proper error checking and cleanup:
     - Returns error codes from `uvc_ctrl_set_handle()` when PM get fails
     - Adds cleanup loop in `uvc_ctrl_cleanup_fh()` to release any remaining PM references
     - Properly pairs `uvc_pm_get()` and `uvc_pm_put()` calls
  4. **No Exploitable Conditions**: There's no:
     - Memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - Privilege escalation opportunity
     - Information disclosure
     - Remote attack vector
     - Denial of service beyond normal PM behavior
  5. **Defensive Programming**: The cleanup function even handles the edge case where `pending_async_ctrls` might be non-zero, adding a loop to properly release all PM references to prevent leaks.
  The commit is part of a series improving power management granularity in the UVC driver, which is a normal driver optimization that doesn't introduce or fix any security vulnerabilities.
2f101572c0a3a media: uvcvideo: Create uvc_pm_(get|put) functions
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It is a pure refactoring change that creates wrapper functions `uvc_pm_get()` and `uvc_pm_put()` to simplify power management code in the UVC video driver. The commit:
  1. **Does not fix any security vulnerability** - It only consolidates existing code patterns into helper functions
  2. **Maintains the same behavior** - The new functions just combine `usb_autopm_get_interface()` + `uvc_status_get()` and their corresponding put operations
  3. **Has proper error handling** - The `uvc_pm_get()` function correctly unwinds on failure by calling `usb_autopm_put_interface()` if `uvc_status_get()` fails
  4. **Is a code cleanup** - As stated in the commit message: "This simplifies the current code and future PM changes in the driver"
  The changes in `uvc_v4l2_open()` and `uvc_v4l2_release()` simply replace the separate calls with the new helper functions, maintaining identical functionality. This is a maintenance/refactoring commit that improves code organization without addressing any security issues.
14f6e205e5599 media: uvcvideo: Keep streaming state in the file handle
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. It is a feature enhancement that adds state tracking for power management purposes, not a security fix. The changes:
  1. Add a `bool is_streaming` field to track streaming state per file handle
  2. Check if already streaming in `streamon` to avoid redundant operations  
  3. Update the flag when streaming starts/stops
  4. Convert to using `guard(mutex)` for cleaner code
  There are no security implications - no memory safety issues, no privilege escalation, no data exposure, and no resource leaks are fixed. This is part of a power management improvement series where the streaming state will be used to manage power references more granularly. The mutex protection is maintained throughout, preventing any race conditions.
1f2889f5594a2 btrfs: fix qgroup reservation leak on failure to allocate ordered extent
- [sasha] Now, let me analyze the security impact based on all the information gathered:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: While this is a resource leak bug, it does not directly enable privilege escalation, data corruption, or unauthorized access. The leak affects quota accounting accuracy but doesn't bypass security boundaries.
  2. **No Direct Exploitability**: The bug requires specific failure conditions (memory allocation failure in `kmem_cache_zalloc`) that are difficult to reliably trigger for malicious purposes. An attacker would need local access and the ability to create memory pressure while performing COW writes.
  3. **Quality of Service Issue**: The primary impact is denial of service through quota exhaustion, but this is more of a reliability/availability issue rather than a security vulnerability. Users would experience EDQUOT errors earlier than expected, but the quota enforcement mechanism itself remains intact.
  4. **Similar Commits Not Assigned CVEs**: Looking at the reference commits provided:
     - Commit 30479f31d44d (similar qgroup leak fix) - CVE Status: YES (but that fixed a more severe leak in a critical path)
     - Commit 2b084d820594 (length calculation fix) - CVE Status: NO
     - Commit d139ded8b9cd (qgroup space freeing) - CVE Status: NO
  5. **Limited Attack Surface**: The vulnerability requires:
     - A btrfs filesystem with quotas enabled (not default)
     - Local access to perform write operations
     - Ability to trigger memory allocation failures
     - The leak accumulates slowly per failed allocation
  The fix correctly adds the missing `btrfs_qgroup_free_refroot()` call in the error path when `kmem_cache_zalloc()` fails for COW operations, properly cleaning up the qgroup reservation that was released but not freed. This is a correctness fix for an edge case rather than a security vulnerability fix.
05a6ec865d091 btrfs: use unsigned types for constants defined as bit shifts
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The commit message explicitly states "Although there are no such cases in btrfs codebase, follow the recommendation." This is a preventative code hardening change that follows best practices for bit shifts by using unsigned types to avoid potential sign extension issues.
  Examining the actual code changes and values:
  - The shift amounts are all small (BITS_PER_BYTE=8, BTRFS_STRIPE_HASH_TABLE_BITS=11, ZSTD_BTRFS_MAX_WINDOWLOG=17)
  - The BTRFS_ORDERED_* enum values start from 0 and increment sequentially
  - None of these shifts approach the problematic value of 31 that would cause sign extension issues
  This is purely defensive programming to follow recommended practices mentioned in CWE-190 and CWE-194, not a fix for any exploitable vulnerability or actual bug in the btrfs code.
ed5915cfce2ab Revert "drm/i915/gem: Allow EXEC_CAPTURE on recoverable contexts on DG1"
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security fix**: This is a revert of a workaround that temporarily relaxed a restriction. The original restriction (preventing EXEC_CAPTURE on recoverable contexts for certain GPUs) was put in place to prevent broken functionality, not to fix a security vulnerability.
  2. **Functionality issue, not security**: The commit message clearly states "error capture of buffer objects is expected to be broken on devices with VRAM." This is about preventing incorrect behavior in error capture functionality, not preventing any security exploitation.
  3. **The code change**: The modification changes from `GRAPHICS_VER_FULL(eb->i915) > IP_VER(12, 10)` back to `(IS_DGFX(eb->i915) || GRAPHICS_VER_FULL(eb->i915) > IP_VER(12, 0))`, which simply re-enables a stricter check that returns -EINVAL when certain conditions are met. This is input validation to prevent broken functionality, not a security boundary.
  4. **Context**: The issue was about compatibility with the intel-media-driver, which was using EXEC_CAPTURE incorrectly. Now that the userspace driver has been fixed, the temporary workaround is being removed. This is typical software compatibility management, not security patching.
  5. **No security impact mentioned**: Neither the original commit, the temporary workaround, nor this revert mention any security implications, privilege escalation, memory corruption, or other security-relevant impacts.
25eeba495b2fc drm/i915/gem: Allow EXEC_CAPTURE on recoverable contexts on DG1
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It relaxes a version check that was preventing EXEC_CAPTURE from working with recoverable contexts on DG1 and other platforms. The change from `(IS_DGFX(eb->i915) || GRAPHICS_VER_FULL(eb->i915) > IP_VER(12, 0))` to `GRAPHICS_VER_FULL(eb->i915) > IP_VER(12, 10)` simply allows more hardware configurations to use the EXEC_CAPTURE debugging feature.
  The commit message clearly indicates this is a functionality fix for intel-media-driver being broken on DG1, not a security fix. EXEC_CAPTURE is an opt-in debugging feature that captures buffer contents for post-mortem analysis during GPU hangs. The original restriction was added as a precaution for potential future kernel changes, not to address any security issue.
547e836661554 btrfs: handle csum tree error with rescue=ibadroots correctly
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Leading to Kernel Crash**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that causes a kernel panic (general protection fault) when using the `rescue=ibadroots` mount option with a corrupted csum tree. The crash trace shows:
     ```
     KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000208-0x000000000000020f]
     RIP: 0010:btrfs_lookup_csum+0x93/0x3d0 [btrfs]
     ```
  2. **Security Bypass**: The bug allows bypassing the intended safety mechanism. When `rescue=ibadroots` is used with a corrupted csum tree, the code should set `BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS` flag to prevent checksum lookups. However, due to the bug, this flag is not set, leading to attempts to use a NULL csum root pointer.
  3. **Logic Error in Error Handling**: The code change shows that when `read_tree_root_path()` fails, the error was being ignored if `IGNOREBADROOTS` option was set:
     ```diff
     -			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
     -				ret = PTR_ERR(root);
     +			ret = PTR_ERR(root);
     ```
     This caused the subsequent check `if (!found || ret)` to fail, skipping the critical step of setting `BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS`.
  4. **Reproducible Attack Vector**: The commit message indicates this was discovered through syzbot with a reproducible test case, suggesting it can be reliably triggered.
  5. **Impact**: The vulnerability can cause a denial of service (kernel crash) when mounting a specially crafted or corrupted btrfs filesystem with specific mount options.
  The fix is simple but critical - it ensures that error returns are properly propagated so that the safety flag `BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS` is set when the csum tree cannot be loaded, preventing the NULL pointer dereference during subsequent checksum operations.
a26bf338cdad3 btrfs: fix race between async reclaim worker and close_ctree()
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The issue is a race condition that only triggers a `WARN_ON_ONCE()` assertion - a non-fatal warning that prints to the kernel log but does not crash the system, cause memory corruption, or create any exploitable security vulnerability. 
  The commit fixes a race between the async reclaim worker and filesystem unmount where the reclaim worker could attempt to add delayed iputs after the `BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DELAYED_IPUT` flag was set. This merely violates an internal assertion check introduced by commit 19e60b2a95f5 for debugging purposes.
  Unlike the similar commits that received CVEs (which involved use-after-free vulnerabilities, system hangs/deadlocks, or kernel crashes), this issue has no actual security impact - it's purely a validation check that helps developers catch logic errors. The system continues to function normally after the warning is triggered.
8a39f1c870e9d ovl: Check for NULL d_inode() in ovl_dentry_upper()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **No actual security vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states "There is no known behavioral bug here." This is purely a fix for an over-eager compiler warning from GCC 15's -Warray-bounds.
  2. **Defensive programming only**: The change adds a NULL check to prevent a theoretical out-of-bounds read that the compiler detected through static analysis. The code path where this could occur doesn't appear to be reachable in practice.
  3. **Compiler warning fix**: The primary purpose is to enable -Warray-bounds globally by fixing false positive warnings. The commit is part of efforts to improve compiler warning coverage, not to fix an actual security issue.
  4. **No exploitation path**: Unlike the similar commits marked with "CVE Status: YES", this commit doesn't fix:
     - A NULL pointer dereference that could actually occur
     - A crash or denial of service condition
     - Any path where user input could trigger the issue
     - Any actual behavioral problem in the kernel
  5. **Pattern differences**: The CVE-assigned similar commits show actual NULL dereference fixes where:
     - Syzbot found crashes (Similar Commit 1 & 2)
     - There were actual error paths leading to NULL dereferences (Similar Commit 3 & 4)
     - The fixes addressed real behavioral bugs, not just theoretical compiler warnings
  This is a proactive code hardening change to satisfy stricter compiler checks, not a security vulnerability fix.
788aa64c01f12 riscv: save the SR_SUM status over switches
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue and the fix. Let me analyze this for CVE assignment:
  Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **YES** - This commit should be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the security implications:
  1. **Security Vulnerability Fixed**: The commit fixes a vulnerability where the SR_SUM (Supervisor User Memory Access) flag state is not properly preserved across context switches. SR_SUM is a critical security flag that controls whether kernel code can access user memory.
  2. **Kernel Access to User Memory**: The crash log shows "Unable to handle kernel access to user memory without uaccess routines". This indicates that kernel code was attempting to access user memory when it should not have been allowed to, which is a security boundary violation.
  3. **Privilege Escalation Risk**: When SR_SUM is incorrectly set/cleared during context switches, it can lead to:
     - Kernel code losing the ability to access user memory when it legitimately needs to (causing crashes)
     - More critically, kernel code potentially retaining access to user memory when it shouldn't, which could lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation
  4. **Race Condition**: The commit message mentions that if two CPUs/harts are racing and switching contexts, one could corrupt the other's state because the SR_SUM flag is not properly saved/restored. This race condition could be exploited.
  5. **Similar to Previous CVEs**: This is similar in nature to other CVE-worthy commits shown in the examples that involve:
     - Memory access control issues (like the riscv misaligned access CVE)
     - Context switching security bugs (like the VMAP_STACK overflow detection CVE)
     - Process state leakage (like the kernel info leakage CVE)
  6. **Code Changes Confirm Security Impact**: The fix adds proper saving of the SR_SUM bit in the `thread.sum` field and restores it during context switches, ensuring that user memory access permissions are correctly maintained across task switches.
  The vulnerability allows improper kernel access to user memory due to incorrect SR_SUM flag handling during context switches, which is a clear security boundary violation that warrants a CVE assignment.
e97633492f5a3 scsi: ufs: core: Don't perform UFS clkscaling during host async scan
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the available context, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a race condition between UFS clock scaling and async SCSI host scanning that causes functional issues (task aborts and warning prints), but does not introduce security vulnerabilities like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond normal operation
  2. **The issues described are functional problems**:
     - "I/O requests issued through new added queues that have not been quiesced, leading to task abort issue" - This is a functional problem where I/O operations fail, not a security issue
     - "warning prints" - This is a logging issue, not a security vulnerability
  3. **The fix is a synchronization improvement**: The change adds `mutex_lock(&hba->host->scan_mutex)` to properly synchronize the clock scaling operation with the async scan process. This prevents the race condition where new LUs (Logical Units) could be added to the tagset while clock scaling is in progress.
  4. **Similar pattern to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (Commits 1-4), they all deal with internal driver synchronization and locking improvements, and none were assigned CVEs. They fix race conditions and improve the robustness of the driver but don't address security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No security impact mentioned**: Neither the commit message nor the code changes indicate any security implications. The problems are limited to operational issues within the UFS driver that affect functionality but not system security.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves driver reliability by preventing a race condition, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it does not fix a security vulnerability.
0abd87942e0c9 ceph: fix possible integer overflow in ceph_zero_objects()
- [sasha] ## Analysis
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit fixes a potential integer overflow issue, but it does not meet the criteria for a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **Limited Security Impact**: The integer overflow occurs when calculating `object_set_size = object_size * stripe_count`. Since both values are s32 (signed 32-bit), their multiplication could theoretically overflow. However:
     - The values come from validated file layout parameters
     - The validation function `ceph_file_layout_is_valid()` ensures both values are non-zero
     - The overflow would only affect internal calculations for file zeroing operations
  2. **No Exploitable Attack Vector**: 
     - The layout parameters are set by the Ceph filesystem during inode initialization from trusted metadata
     - Regular users cannot directly control these values
     - The overflow would result in incorrect calculations but not memory corruption or privilege escalation
  3. **Similar to Commit 1**: Like the first similar commit which was marked "CVE Status: NO", this fixes calculation issues that could lead to incorrect behavior but not exploitable vulnerabilities. The first commit fixed buffer overflow access issues in read operations, while this fixes an arithmetic overflow in zeroing operations.
  4. **Functional Bug, Not Security Vulnerability**: The issue would manifest as incorrect file zeroing behavior when dealing with very large stripe configurations, but wouldn't allow attackers to:
     - Access unauthorized data
     - Escalate privileges  
     - Cause denial of service
     - Corrupt memory
  The commits marked "CVE Status: YES" in the examples involved actual security issues like memory leaks (resource exhaustion) and reference counting bugs (use-after-free potential), which have clear security implications. This integer overflow is a correctness issue without direct security impact.
9adf2de86611a ASoC: rt1320: fix speaker noise when volume bar is 100%
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Audio Quality Issue, Not Security**: The commit fixes "speaker noise when volume bar is 100%" - this is purely an audio quality/user experience issue. The noise is an undesirable audio artifact, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **Hardware Configuration Changes**: The changes consist of modifying initialization values in `rt1320_vc_blind_write[]` - these are hardware register settings that control the audio codec's internal parameters. The modifications:
     - Change register 0x1000db00 from 0x04 to 0x07
     - Add 15 new register configurations (0x1000db15-0x1000db23)
  3. **No Security-Sensitive Components**: The affected code is in the audio codec driver initialization sequence. There's no evidence of:
     - Memory corruption fixes
     - Buffer overflow fixes
     - Access control changes
     - Input validation improvements
     - Privilege escalation fixes
     - Information disclosure fixes
  4. **Similar Non-CVE Precedents**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - "ASoC: tas2770: Fix volume scale" (NO CVE) - adjusts volume scaling
     - "ASoC: rt715-sdca: volume step modification" (NO CVE) - fixes volume step format
     - "ASoC: cs35l56: Limit Speaker Volume to +12dB maximum" (NO CVE) - limits volume range
     - "ASoC: rt5640: Fix the issue of speaker noise" (NO CVE) - similar speaker noise fix
  5. **Functional Fix**: This is a functional fix to improve audio quality at maximum volume levels, similar to other audio codec adjustments that correct hardware behavior for better user experience.
  The commit is a typical audio driver enhancement that addresses a quality issue, not a security vulnerability.
4919353c7789b ALSA: usb-audio: Add a quirk for Lenovo Thinkpad Thunderbolt 3 dock
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It adds a device-specific workaround (quirk) for the Lenovo Thinkpad Thunderbolt 3 dock's audio controller, which doesn't support reading the sampling rate. 
  The analysis shows:
  1. **Not a security fix**: The commit adds `QUIRK_FLAG_GET_SAMPLE_RATE` which simply skips reading the sample rate back from the device after setting it. This is a compatibility/functionality fix, not a security fix.
  2. **No security impact**: The code change only affects how the driver interacts with this specific USB audio device. When this flag is set, the driver skips the verification step of reading back the sample rate after setting it, avoiding errors with devices that don't support this operation.
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: This is very similar to the reference commits provided (adding delay quirks for various USB audio devices), which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO". These are all device-specific compatibility fixes.
  4. **No sensitive components affected**: The change doesn't affect memory management, access control, input validation, or any other security-sensitive areas. It's purely a functional workaround for hardware that doesn't conform to the expected USB audio specification.
  The commit is a simple hardware compatibility fix that allows the Lenovo dock's audio to work properly by avoiding an unsupported operation.
ab72bfce76475 ALSA: hda: Add new pci id for AMD GPU display HD audio controller
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The commit simply adds a new PCI device ID (0xab40) for an AMD GPU display HD audio controller to the existing device ID table in the hda_intel driver. This is a hardware enablement change that:
  1. **Does not fix any security vulnerability** - It's adding support for new hardware, not fixing an existing security issue
  2. **Does not change any security-sensitive logic** - It only adds an entry to the PCI device ID table with the same driver configuration flags as other similar AMD devices
  3. **Follows the same pattern as reference commits** - All the similar commits shown (adding PCI IDs for Intel PTL-H, AMD processors, etc.) were marked with "CVE Status: NO"
  4. **Uses standard driver capabilities** - The added entry uses `AZX_DRIVER_ATIHDMI_NS | AZX_DCAPS_PRESET_ATI_HDMI_NS | AZX_DCAPS_PM_RUNTIME`, which are the same flags used by other AMD HDMI audio devices in the same driver
  The code change is purely additive - it extends hardware support without modifying any existing functionality or fixing any security issues.
3f100f524e755 ALSA: hda: Ignore unsol events for cards being shut down
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds an additional check `codec->card->shutdown` alongside the existing `codec->bus->shutdown` check in the `hda_codec_unsol_event()` function. This is a defensive programming improvement, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **No security vulnerability being fixed**: The commit message clearly explains this is to handle a specific architectural difference between the classic `snd_hda_intel` driver and the DSP `snd_soc_avs` driver. In the AVS driver, multiple codecs can be on multiple cards, and one card may be shutting down while others are operational.
  3. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication of:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Use-after-free conditions
     - Null pointer dereferences being fixed
  4. **Code safety**: The code shows that `codec->card` is always assigned during codec initialization in `snd_hda_codec_device_new()` (line 999), so there's no risk of null pointer dereference from this change.
  5. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Commit 2 (CVE Status: YES) fixed an actual null pointer dereference
     - Commit 5 (CVE Status: YES) fixed a potential soft lockup issue
     - This commit is more similar to commits 1, 3, and 4 (all NO CVE) which are feature improvements or workarounds
  This is a legitimate architectural improvement to properly handle shutdown states in multi-codec configurations, not a security vulnerability fix.
1317045a7d6f3 riscv: misaligned: declare misaligned_access_speed under CONFIG_RISCV_MISALIGNED
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue completely. Let me analyze if this is a security vulnerability:
  ## Analysis Summary:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a compilation/configuration issue fix, not a security vulnerability. The commit resolves a build-time problem where `misaligned_access_speed` was being used in code compiled under `CONFIG_RISCV_MISALIGNED` but was only declared under the more specific `CONFIG_RISCV_SCALAR_MISALIGNED`.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes show:
     - Moving a declaration from one `#ifdef` block to another more general one
     - Removing an `#ifdef` guard around a line that sets a per-CPU variable
     - This doesn't introduce any new functionality or fix any runtime security issues
  3. **Build/configuration fix only**: The commit message explicitly states "This resulted in compilation problems" - it's fixing a build failure, not a runtime security issue.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Or any other security-relevant behavior change
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This is similar to the first two example commits which were marked as "CVE Status: NO" - they also dealt with build/configuration adjustments and function annotations without security implications.
  The commit is purely a build system/configuration fix to ensure proper compilation when certain kernel configuration options are enabled. It has no security implications and should not be assigned a CVE.
11709abccf93b s390/mm: Fix in_atomic() handling in do_secure_storage_access()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a kernel programming error fix that prevents a "sleeping function called from invalid context" warning/bug. The issue occurs when the kernel tries to take the `mmap_lock` (which can sleep) while in atomic context.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a correctness issue, not a security vulnerability. When in atomic context:
     - Before the fix: The kernel would incorrectly try to resolve the page fault by taking `mmap_lock`, leading to a kernel warning/bug about sleeping in atomic context
     - After the fix: The kernel properly returns `-EFAULT` without taking the lock, allowing the caller to retry in process context
  3. **Impact is limited to debugging/correctness**: The main impact is that with debug options enabled, you get kernel warnings. The fix ensures proper error handling by returning `-EFAULT` when fault handling is disabled (atomic context), which is the correct behavior.
  4. **Similar to CVE Status: NO commits**: This is similar to the lockdep fix commit shown in the examples, which was marked as NO CVE. Both fix issues with taking locks in inappropriate contexts but don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  5. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: The change doesn't fix any privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues. It simply ensures the kernel follows proper locking rules in atomic contexts.
  The commit improves kernel robustness and correctness but does not address a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
ca358692de41b riscv: add a data fence for CMODX in the kernel mode
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a Security Vulnerability Fix**: This commit adds a memory fence to ensure proper ordering according to the RISC-V specification. It's a correctness fix for potential race conditions in code modification scenarios, not a fix for an exploitable security vulnerability.
  2. **Theoretical vs Practical Impact**: The commit message states that "current riscv drivers for IPI use ordered MMIO when sending IPIs", meaning existing implementations already handle the ordering correctly. The fence is added as a defensive measure against potential future implementations that might not order properly.
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Security Boundary Crossing**: The issue relates to cache coherency between CPU cores during kernel code modification (like ftrace, kprobes, etc.). While incorrect ordering could theoretically lead to stale instruction execution, there's no evidence this creates an exploitable security vulnerability that could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or system compromise.
  4. **Similar to Architecture Compliance Fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-3), they also deal with RISC-V cache coherency and IPI-related fixes, and none were assigned CVEs. These are architectural correctness fixes rather than security vulnerability fixes.
  5. **Code Changes Analysis**: The change adds `RISCV_FENCE(w, o)` which translates to a `fence w,o` instruction - ensuring writes complete before device outputs (IPIs). This is a preventive measure for correctness, not a fix for an active security vulnerability.
  The commit is important for ensuring RISC-V specification compliance and preventing potential future issues, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a CVE assignment as it's not fixing an exploitable security vulnerability.
0f7bbef1794dc usb: typec: mux: do not return on EOPNOTSUPP in {mux, switch}_set
- [sasha] Now I have enough context to analyze this commit. Let me summarize my findings:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It is a functional improvement that changes error handling behavior in the USB Type-C mux/switch subsystem.
  The change modifies `typec_switch_set()` and `typec_mux_set()` functions to continue iterating through multiple mux/switch devices when one returns `-EOPNOTSUPP` (operation not supported), rather than immediately returning the error.
  Key points:
  1. **Not a security fix**: This addresses a functional limitation where legitimate configurations with multiple muxes/switches for different lanes (USB2, USB3, SBU) would fail if one device didn't support a particular mode.
  2. **No security impact**: The change only affects error handling flow. It doesn't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security-relevant issues.
  3. **Expected behavior**: The commit message clearly explains this is intended behavior - when multiple mux/switch devices are registered for different purposes (e.g., one for USB data, another for audio), not all will handle every mode, so `-EOPNOTSUPP` is an expected response that shouldn't stop processing other devices.
  4. **No vulnerability being patched**: The previous behavior wasn't a vulnerability - it was overly restrictive error handling that prevented valid hardware configurations from working properly.
  This is similar to the reference commits which also made functional improvements to the Type-C subsystem without fixing security vulnerabilities.
aaa8f2e959341 usb: typec: tipd: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit fixes a memory leak where wakeup source memory is allocated during probe but not freed during device unbind. The change from `device_init_wakeup()` to `devm_device_init_wakeup()` ensures proper cleanup through the device-managed resource framework.
  This is not a security vulnerability because:
  1. It's a simple memory leak with minimal impact - only leaks a small struct per unbind
  2. Requires root privileges to unbind/rebind drivers 
  3. Cannot be exploited for privilege escalation or code execution
  4. Similar wakeup source leak fixes (gpio-mpc8xxx, gpio-zynq) were not assigned CVEs
  5. Unlike the USB TypeC UCSI commits that got CVEs (which fixed NULL pointer dereferences that could crash the system), this is just a resource leak
9fc5986fbcd7e usb: typec: tcpci: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It fixes a simple memory leak that occurs when the TCPCI Maxim USB Type-C driver is unbound without proper cleanup of wakeup source resources. The issue:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: It's a resource leak with no exploitable security impact
  2. **Requires privileged access**: Unbinding drivers requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN (root)
  3. **Minimal impact**: Leaks only ~200 bytes per unbind operation
  4. **Follows established pattern**: Similar commits 1 & 2 (gpio-mpc8xxx, gpio-zynq) fixing identical wakeup source leaks were not assigned CVEs
  5. **No crash/DoS potential**: Unlike commit 5 which fixed a use-after-free, this cannot cause system instability
  The fix simply changes `device_init_wakeup()` to `devm_device_init_wakeup()` to ensure automatic cleanup via the device resource management framework.
b4b38ffb38c91 usb: typec: displayport: Receive DP Status Update NAK request exit dp altmode
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit adds proper protocol handling for a specific USB Type-C DisplayPort alternate mode scenario. When a device responds with NAK (negative acknowledgment) to a DP Status Update command, the driver now properly exits the alternate mode.
  2. **Functional/compatibility issue**: The commit addresses a functional issue where certain devices (like Huawei Mate 40Pro) that don't support DP Sink function would cause a Hard Reset when attempting a data role swap while in alternate mode. This is a protocol compliance and compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
  3. **No security impact**: The code change simply adds a case to handle DP_CMD_STATUS_UPDATE NAK by calling `typec_altmode_exit()`. This is proper protocol handling that prevents an undesirable Hard Reset, but doesn't fix any:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypass
     - Buffer overflow
     - Race condition with security implications
  4. **Limited scope**: The change is minimal (4 lines added) and only affects the behavior when a specific protocol message (NAK) is received. It doesn't expose any previously protected resources or create new attack vectors.
  5. **User-triggered but not exploitable**: While the scenario can be triggered by user action (echo to sysfs), the worst outcome is a failed data role swap and Hard Reset, which is a functional issue rather than a security vulnerability.
  The commit improves protocol compliance and device compatibility but does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
937a8a3a8d46a usb: gadget: f_hid: wake up readers on disable/unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This fix addresses a **reliability/availability issue** rather than a security vulnerability. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the Issue**: The commit fixes a hang condition where reader threads could get stuck waiting indefinitely when the USB HID gadget function is disabled or unbound. This is a denial-of-service type issue but only affects the local system's functionality.
  2. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The issue doesn't involve:
     - Privilege escalation
     - Memory corruption that could lead to code execution
     - Information disclosure
     - Authentication bypass
     - Access control violations
  3. **Limited Impact**: The impact is limited to:
     - Reader threads getting stuck (hang)
     - Potential corruption of wait queues when reinitialized in `hidg_bind()`
     - This only affects the specific USB gadget functionality, not system-wide security
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: 
     - Similar Commit 1 (USB gadget function wakeup support) - NO CVE: Feature addition
     - Similar Commit 2 (printer gadget race fixes) - NO CVE: Race condition fixes
     - Similar Commit 4 (HID driver READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE) - NO CVE: Race condition clarity
     - The pattern shows that simple race conditions and hangs in USB gadget drivers typically don't get CVEs unless they have security implications
  5. **Local DoS Only**: This is essentially a local denial-of-service issue that requires specific conditions (USB HID gadget being used and then disabled/unbound). It doesn't provide any attack vector for remote exploitation or local privilege escalation.
  While this is an important bug fix that prevents system hangs and ensures proper cleanup, it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
387602d8a7557 usb: cdc-wdm: avoid setting WDM_READ for ZLP-s
- [sasha] Now I have a good understanding of the issue. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it fixes a userspace hang/busy-loop issue that occurs when Zero Length Packets (ZLPs) are received by the USB CDC-WDM driver.
  The issue is:
  1. When a ZLP (zero-length packet) is received, the driver was incorrectly setting the WDM_READ flag
  2. This causes poll() to indicate data is available (EPOLLIN) when there actually isn't any
  3. Userspace applications (like glib) that do non-blocking reads would then:
     - See poll() indicating data is available
     - Try to read the data
     - Get EAGAIN because there's no actual data (it was a ZLP)
     - Loop back to poll() which still indicates data is available
     - This creates an infinite busy loop
  The fix correctly handles ZLPs by:
  1. Not setting WDM_READ for zero-length packets
  2. Instead jumping to the error handling path that schedules work to handle outstanding interrupts
  3. Only setting WDM_READ in service_interrupt_work when there's actual data (`desc->length`) or an error (`desc->rerr`)
  This is a quality/reliability issue rather than a security vulnerability because:
  - It doesn't allow privilege escalation
  - It doesn't cause memory corruption or overflow
  - It doesn't leak sensitive information
  - It's a userspace application hang that affects only the application making the read call
  - The kernel itself remains stable and functional
  - Other processes are not affected
  The similar commits provide good context - CVE assignments were given to commits that fixed actual security issues like CPU lockups caused by excessive kernel logging (commits 3 and 4), while commits fixing race conditions without security impact (commits 1 and 2) were not assigned CVEs.
82fe5107fa3d2 usb: Add checks for snprintf() calls in usb_alloc_dev()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No actual security vulnerability exists**: The commit message explicitly states "Since everything works until now" and "It is most likely a never happen situation." This is a theoretical issue found by compiler warnings, not an exploitable vulnerability.
  2. **Buffer overflow is prevented by USB topology constraints**: 
     - The devpath format builds paths like "1.2.3.4" representing the USB topology
     - USB hubs are limited to 31 ports (USB_MAXCHILDREN)
     - The recursive path construction and USB hub depth limitations prevent the string from ever exceeding 16 bytes in practice
     - The commit comment mentions "Route string assumes hubs have less than 16 ports"
  3. **The change is defensive programming, not a security fix**:
     - The added check (`if (n >= sizeof(dev->devpath))`) is purely to satisfy compiler warnings when building with `make W=1`
     - GCC cannot analyze the USB topology constraints and assumes worst-case integer sizes
     - The commit message states the goal is to "make GCC happy"
  4. **No privilege escalation or data corruption path**:
     - Even if theoretically triggered, this would cause device allocation to fail cleanly
     - The function returns NULL on error, which is properly handled
     - No memory corruption or privilege escalation is possible
  This is similar to the non-CVE examples provided where defensive bounds checking was added to prevent theoretical issues flagged by static analysis, but no actual exploitable vulnerability existed.
d4e5b10c55627 usb: common: usb-conn-gpio: use a unique name for usb connector device
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the kernel code, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security fix**: The commit adds functionality to handle duplicate device names by using unique IDs (via IDA), but it's not fixing a security vulnerability. It's addressing a functional limitation where multiple USB connectors would conflict due to duplicate "usb-charger" names.
  2. **No security impact**: The issue being fixed is a naming conflict in the power supply subsystem that would prevent proper registration of multiple USB connectors. This would result in functional failures (device registration errors) rather than security issues like:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service beyond simple device registration failure
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Commit 1 (CVE: YES) fixed a NULL pointer dereference that could cause system crashes
     - Commits 2-5 (CVE: NO) were functional improvements, driver updates, or non-security bug fixes
  4. **Code analysis**: The changes simply:
     - Add an IDA (ID allocator) to generate unique IDs
     - Change the fixed "usb-charger" name to "usb-charger-N" format
     - Properly free the allocated ID on removal
     - This is purely a naming/registration issue without security implications
  5. **Failure mode**: If duplicate names were attempted before this fix, the power supply registration would simply fail with an error, not cause any exploitable condition.
  This is a functional improvement that allows multiple USB connector devices to coexist properly, not a security vulnerability fix.
6bd697b5fc39f tty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init
- [sasha] Based on the analysis, let me now provide my assessment.
  **YES**
  This commit fixes a race condition that leads to a kernel NULL pointer dereference and system crash. Here's why this deserves a CVE:
  1. **Security Impact**: The commit fixes a NULL pointer dereference that causes a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The crash occurs at address 0x00000000000002b8 when trying to acquire a mutex lock.
  2. **Race Condition Vulnerability**: The issue occurs when two UART devices probe concurrently. One thread can bypass the uart driver registration check (`if (!ulite_uart_driver.state)`) while another thread is in the process of registering the driver. This leads to `ulite_assign()` calling `uart_add_one_port()` with an uninitialized uart_driver structure.
  3. **Critical Code Path**: The crash happens in `uart_add_one_port()` when it tries to access the `state` member of uart_driver, which is allocated during `uart_register_driver()`. If the driver isn't fully registered, `drv->state` is NULL, causing the dereference.
  4. **Exploitability**: While this appears to be a race condition requiring specific timing, it can be triggered during normal system operation when multiple UART devices are present and initializing simultaneously. This could potentially be triggered by an attacker with the ability to control device initialization timing.
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: The pattern is similar to other serial driver race conditions that have received CVEs (like the max3100 and w1-uart examples provided). These also involved race conditions during driver initialization leading to NULL pointer dereferences.
  The fix moves uart driver registration from the probe function to the module init function, ensuring the driver is always fully registered before any device can probe, eliminating the race condition window.
153874010354d usb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Type mismatch without security impact**: While there is a type mismatch between `unsigned long tpgt` and `u16 tport_tpgt`, this is a correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability. The commit prevents potential data truncation, but the truncation itself does not lead to exploitable security consequences.
  2. **No array bounds violation**: Unlike the referenced vhost/scsi commit (59c816c1f24d) where the value was used as an array index that could lead to out-of-bounds access, the `tport_tpgt` value in the USB gadget code is only:
     - Stored in the structure at line 1690: `tpg->tport_tpgt = tpgt;`
     - Returned by `usbg_get_tag()` at line 1573: `return tpg->tport_tpgt;`
     
  3. **No memory corruption**: The commit message mentions "potential integer overflow," but this is misleading. What actually happens is silent truncation when assigning a larger value to a smaller type, not an overflow that could corrupt memory or bypass security checks.
  4. **Input validation already present**: The original code already had bounds checking (`tpgt > UINT_MAX`), though it was checking against the wrong limit. The value comes from user input through configfs, but even with truncation, it doesn't lead to security issues.
  5. **Comparison with similar CVE commits**: The similar commits shown (CDC-NCM and vhost/scsi) involved actual security vulnerabilities where integer overflows or incorrect bounds could lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds array access, or memory corruption. This USB gadget commit lacks these characteristics.
  The fix improves code correctness by ensuring the input validation matches the actual storage type, but it doesn't address a security vulnerability.
a99b598d836c9 misc: tps6594-pfsm: Add NULL pointer check in tps6594_pfsm_probe()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability**: The code in `tps6594_pfsm_probe()` uses `devm_kasprintf()` to allocate and format a string for `pfsm->miscdev.name`. This function can return NULL on memory allocation failure, but the original code did not check for this condition.
  2. **Security Impact**: When `misc_register()` is called at line 305 (now 308), it passes the potentially NULL `misc->name` to `device_create_with_groups()` at drivers/char/misc.c:247. This function uses the name as a format string parameter, which will cause a NULL pointer dereference if the name is NULL, leading to a kernel crash.
  3. **Exploitability**: While memory allocation failures are typically hard to trigger reliably, an attacker with the ability to exhaust kernel memory could potentially trigger this condition during device probe, causing a denial of service through kernel panic.
  4. **Pattern Consistency**: This fix follows the exact same pattern as the similar commits shown in the reference list, all of which were assigned CVEs. For example:
     - The ice driver fix (commit 3027e7b15b02) for the same devm_kasprintf NULL check issue
     - Multiple other commits fixing identical patterns with devm_kasprintf NULL checks
  5. **Component Sensitivity**: The TPS6594 PFSM driver handles power management state machine functionality, which is a security-sensitive component as it controls power states of the system.
  The fix correctly adds the NULL check after `devm_kasprintf()` and returns `-ENOMEM` on allocation failure, preventing the NULL pointer dereference from occurring.
ad02ca57e44e9 iio: hid-sensor-prox: Add support for 16-bit report size
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Not a security fix**: This commit adds support for 16-bit report sizes, which is a feature enhancement rather than fixing a security vulnerability. The commit message clearly states it's adding support for platforms that use 16-bit HID_USAGE_SENSOR_HUMAN_PROXIMITY reports.
  2. **No security vulnerability introduced or fixed**: The code changes show:
     - Addition of a `case 2:` handler for 16-bit data (`*(u16 *)raw_data`)
     - This is consistent with existing handlers for 8-bit (`case 1:`) and 32-bit (`case 4:`) data
     - The bounds checking remains intact: `if (chan == prox_state->num_channels) return -EINVAL;`
  3. **Safe implementation**: 
     - The `chan` index is properly validated before use
     - The array access `prox_state->human_presence[chan]` is protected by bounds checking
     - No buffer overflows or memory corruption risks are introduced
  4. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: This change is similar to the other commits shown in the reference examples that were marked as "CVE Status: NO", which also involved adding support for different data formats or fixing non-security issues in IIO drivers.
  The commit simply extends functionality to support hardware that reports 16-bit proximity values, maintaining the same safety checks as the existing code.
4d71bf6021818 iio: adc: ad7606_spi: check error in ad7606B_sw_mode_config()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now make a determination about whether this commit should be assigned a CVE.
  **NO**
  This commit adds missing error checking in `ad7606B_sw_mode_config()` for the `reg_write()` operation that configures the AD7606B ADC to output on a single channel. While this is a good programming practice fix, it does not address a security vulnerability because:
  1. **No security boundary crossed**: This is a configuration error in an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) driver. If the SPI write fails, the device configuration would be incorrect, but this doesn't lead to memory corruption, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  2. **Limited impact**: The failure to configure the device to single channel output mode would result in incorrect ADC operation or data format issues, but not a security vulnerability. The worst case is that the ADC channels wouldn't be configured properly, leading to functional issues rather than security issues.
  3. **Error propagation**: The callers of `sw_mode_config()` already check for error returns (as seen in ad7606.c lines 1167-1169 and line 1203), so the error would be properly propagated up the stack once this fix is applied.
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (ad7606 scale fix, ad9467 cleanup, ad7173/ad7192 calibration fixes, ad4000 mutex init check), none were assigned CVEs despite being error handling improvements in the same driver subsystem.
  This is a quality improvement that ensures proper error handling and prevents silent configuration failures, but it does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
c0461f8e84249 iio: light: al3000a: Fix an error handling path in al3000a_probe()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Resource leak, not a security vulnerability**: The bug is a simple resource leak where the power regulator remains enabled if `regmap_write()` fails during initialization. The original code had `devm_add_action_or_reset()` placed after `al3000a_init()`, so if any of the `regmap_write()` calls in `al3000a_init()` failed, the cleanup function `al3000a_set_pwr_off()` would not be registered, leaving the regulator enabled.
  2. **No security impact**: This is an IIO (Industrial I/O) light sensor driver bug that:
     - Only affects power management/resource cleanup
     - Does not expose sensitive information
     - Does not allow privilege escalation
     - Does not create memory corruption
     - Does not enable unauthorized access
     - Simply leaves a voltage regulator enabled on error, which is a functional bug, not a security issue
  3. **Limited scope**: The issue only occurs during probe failure scenarios and results in slightly increased power consumption, not any security-relevant behavior.
  4. **Comparison with similar commits**: Looking at the provided similar commits:
     - Similar Commit 1 (al3010, CVE Status: NO) - Also fixes a power management cleanup issue in error paths
     - Similar Commit 2 (mlx90635, CVE Status: YES) - Fixes an ERR_PTR dereference which could cause crashes
     - The al3000a fix is more similar to Commit 1 (resource leak) than Commit 2 (potential crash)
  The fix properly moves the cleanup registration immediately after power-on to ensure proper cleanup in all error paths, but this is a quality/correctness fix, not a security fix.
029035636de37 iio: dac: adi-axi-dac: add cntrl chan check
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The channel values come from kernel-controlled IIO channel specifications, not directly from userspace input. The `chan->channel` value is part of the `struct iio_chan_spec` which is typically defined statically in the driver or configured through device tree, not dynamically set by unprivileged users.
  2. **Register Access Protection**: The driver uses Linux's regmap framework which provides bounds checking. The regmap configuration shows `max_register = 0x0800`, which means attempts to access registers beyond this limit would be caught by the regmap layer before reaching hardware.
  3. **Limited Impact**: Even without these checks, accessing out-of-bounds registers would result in regmap rejecting the access and returning an error, not causing memory corruption or system compromise. The calculation shows that channel 16 and above would generate register addresses beyond 0x0800.
  4. **Defensive Programming**: This appears to be defensive programming to add explicit validation rather than fixing an actual exploitable vulnerability. The commit message simply states "Add validity check" without mentioning any security implications or actual bug being fixed.
  5. **Similar Pattern in IIO**: The IIO subsystem commonly adds such validation checks as good practice for robustness, but these are typically not security vulnerabilities since the channel configurations come from trusted sources (kernel driver or device tree).
  The commit adds bounds checking for channel values (0-15) to prevent potential out-of-bounds register access, but this is a robustness improvement rather than a security fix, as there's no apparent path for unprivileged users to control these channel values.
e5cdb098a3cb1 iio: adc: ad_sigma_delta: Fix use of uninitialized status_pos
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes an uninitialized variable bug, but it does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment. Here's why:
  1. **Limited Impact**: The uninitialized `status_pos` variable is only used when `sigma_delta->status_appended` is true (line 605). If status_appended is false, the code path using status_pos is never executed.
  2. **Bounded Access**: When used, `status_pos` indexes into the `data` array (line 608: `data[status_pos]`), which points to `sigma_delta->rx_buf`. The rx_buf is a fixed-size array of 16 bytes. Given that:
     - reg_size can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on typical realbits values (8, 16, 24, 32 bits)
     - status_pos would be at most reg_size + 1 = 5 in the worst case
     - This is well within the 16-byte rx_buf bounds
  3. **No Privilege Escalation or Data Exposure**: The worst outcome would be reading an incorrect status byte from within the same kernel buffer, potentially causing incorrect channel synchronization. This would affect data quality but not security.
  4. **Driver-Specific Context**: This is in an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) driver subsystem used for reading sensor data. The impact is limited to potentially incorrect sensor readings or driver malfunction, not system compromise.
  5. **Smatch Detection**: This was caught by static analysis (Smatch), indicating it's a code quality issue rather than an exploitable vulnerability.
  The similar commits provided as reference (all marked "CVE Status: NO") show comparable patterns - they fix initialization issues, ordering problems, or configuration bugs in IIO ADC drivers, none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities with meaningful impact.
af076a41f8a28 usb: dwc2: also exit clock_gating when stopping udc while suspended
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code context, here is my assessment:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug fix that addresses improper clock gating management when the UDC (USB Device Controller) is stopped while suspended. The issue causes enumeration errors on the host side but does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
  2. **Nature of the fix**: The change simply ensures that clock gating is properly exited when stopping the UDC while the bus is suspended. This prevents the PHY from remaining in an unclocked state, which causes USB enumeration issues.
  3. **Impact is limited to functionality**: The commit message explicitly states the impact: "connecting this powered but not clocked phy leads to enumeration errors on the host side." This is a functional issue affecting USB device enumeration, not a security concern.
  4. **Similar to other clock gating fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided (commits 1-5), none of them received CVEs despite dealing with similar clock gating issues in USB controllers. They all address timing, synchronization, or state management issues that affect functionality but not security.
  5. **No security-sensitive operations affected**: The code change doesn't affect:
     - Memory management or buffer handling
     - Access control or privilege levels
     - Input validation or bounds checking
     - Authentication or authorization
     - Information disclosure
  The fix is a straightforward addition of clock gating exit logic to ensure proper PHY clock state management during UDC shutdown, preventing USB enumeration failures - a pure functionality issue with no security implications.
a4e65842e1142 coresight: Only check bottom two claim bits
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, here's my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  This commit is a defensive programming improvement that hardens the claim mechanism implementation, but it does not fix an actual security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit masks off the upper bits of the CLAIMCLR register to only check bits [1:0] when reading claim tags. Previously, it was comparing the entire 32-bit register value.
  2. **No current security impact**: The upper bits of the CLAIMCLR register are currently unused/reserved. The code was working correctly because those bits are zero in current implementations. The change is preventive - it ensures the code will continue to work correctly if future hardware implementations use the upper bits for other purposes.
  3. **Claim mechanism purpose**: The claim tag mechanism is used for coordinating access to CoreSight debug components between different agents (kernel driver vs external debugger). It's not a security boundary but rather a cooperation mechanism.
  4. **No exploitable condition**: There's no evidence in the commit message or code that this fixes an exploitable condition. The worst case scenario would be incorrect claim state detection if future hardware used the upper bits, which would result in debug functionality not working properly, not a security breach.
  5. **Similar to historical commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (which were all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this follows the same pattern of code cleanup and hardening in the CoreSight subsystem without fixing actual vulnerabilities.
  The commit improves code robustness and follows the specification more precisely, but it doesn't address any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
c40b91e38eb8d 8250: microchip: pci1xxxx: Add PCIe Hot reset disable support for Rev C0 and later devices
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes add hardware-specific functionality to preserve UART configuration during PCIe hot resets on Microchip PCI1XXXX devices (revision C0 and later). The code simply sets/clears the `UART_RESET_HOT_RESET_DISABLE` bit (BIT(17)) during suspend/resume operations to prevent configuration loss. This is a reliability improvement that addresses device inaccessibility after suspend/resume cycles, but has no security implications - no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other exploitable conditions are introduced or fixed by this change.
6767e8784cd2e um: use proper care when taking mmap lock during segfault
- [sasha] Now I have a clear understanding of what happened. Let me analyze this commit:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Instead, it refactors the UML (User Mode Linux) page fault handling code to use a more careful approach when taking the mmap lock during segfaults.
  Key analysis points:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a code quality improvement and consistency fix. The commit brings UML's segfault handling in line with how other architectures handle the mmap lock during page faults.
  2. **The problem being addressed**: The old code in UML was using a simple `mmap_read_lock(mm)` approach which could potentially deadlock if a kernel bug causes a page fault while the mmap lock is already held for writing. This is not a security vulnerability, but rather a robustness issue.
  3. **The solution**: The commit copies the careful locking approach from `mm/mmap_lock.c` (used by other architectures) and adapts it for UML. The main difference is that UML doesn't have exception tables, so the code checks `is_user` instead of searching exception tables.
  4. **No security impact**: 
     - The old code wasn't vulnerable to exploitation
     - There's no privilege escalation, memory corruption, or information disclosure being fixed
     - This is about preventing potential deadlocks in edge cases, not fixing security holes
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided:
     - Similar Commit 1 and 2 also deal with mmap lock handling improvements without security implications
     - These are architectural improvements for robustness
  The commit improves the reliability of UML's fault handling by preventing potential deadlocks, but it does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
674d03f6bd6b0 um: Add cmpxchg8b_emu and checksum functions to asm-prototypes.h
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. It addresses a build failure that occurs when CONFIG_GENDWARFKSYMS is enabled for the UML (User Mode Linux) architecture. The changes are:
  1. **Build system fix**: The commit adds missing function prototypes to `arch/um/include/asm/asm-prototypes.h` to fix compilation errors when GENDWARFKSYMS is enabled.
  2. **No security implications**: 
     - The added declarations for `cmpxchg8b_emu` and checksum functions (`csum_partial_copy_generic`) are simply header declarations
     - These functions already exist in the codebase and are exported symbols
     - The issue is purely a missing prototype declaration needed by the build system when generating DWARF symbol information
     - No actual code behavior is changed
  3. **Similar to reference commits**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits shown (adding missing prototypes to fix -Wmissing-prototypes warnings), which were all marked as "CVE Status: NO"
  The commit is a build infrastructure fix to ensure UML can compile with CONFIG_GENDWARFKSYMS enabled, not a security fix. There are no memory safety issues, access control problems, or other security vulnerabilities being addressed.
6348f62ef7ecc bus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Add Telit FN920C04 modem support
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **Nature of Change**: This commit is purely adding support for a new hardware device (Telit FN920C04 modem) to the existing MHI PCI generic driver. It follows the exact same pattern as all the similar commits shown in the history (Telit FN990, FE990A, etc.).
  2. **Code Changes**: The changes consist of:
     - Adding channel configuration array (`mhi_telit_fn920c04_channels`)
     - Adding controller configuration structure (`modem_telit_fn920c04_config`)
     - Adding device info structure (`mhi_telit_fn920c04_info`)
     - Adding PCI device ID entry to the ID table
  3. **No Security Vulnerabilities**: The commit:
     - Does not fix any existing security vulnerability
     - Does not introduce any new security issues
     - Uses standard MHI channel configurations similar to other devices
     - The `edl_trigger = true` setting is a standard feature for emergency download mode, used by other similar devices
  4. **Similar Commits**: All the similar commits provided as reference (adding support for Telit FE990, fixing names, updating firmware paths, etc.) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", which is consistent with hardware enablement patches.
  This is a routine hardware enablement patch that adds support for a new modem variant without any security implications.
886a446b76afd iio: pressure: zpa2326: Use aligned_s64 for the timestamp
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the context gathered from the kernel tree, I can now make a determination.
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is purely a technical alignment improvement that changes `u64 timestamp` to `aligned_s64 timestamp` in a struct. It does not fix any security vulnerability.
  2. **No information leak or memory safety issue**: Unlike the previous commit 6007d10c5262 which was assigned a CVE for fixing an information leak (uninitialized memory being sent to userspace), this commit only addresses alignment concerns. The previous security fix already added `memset(&sample, 0, sizeof(sample))` to zero out the entire structure, preventing any information leaks.
  3. **Alignment optimization, not security**: The change from `u64` to `aligned_s64` forces 8-byte alignment on all architectures, including x86_32 where s64 is normally only 4-byte aligned. This is a portability and consistency improvement, not a security fix. As shown in the kernel headers, `aligned_s64` is simply `__s64 __attribute__((aligned(8)))`.
  4. **Part of a larger cleanup series**: Looking at the surrounding commits, this appears to be part of a systematic cleanup effort to use aligned types consistently across the IIO subsystem, not a response to any security issue.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: The misalignment on x86_32 systems would not create any exploitable condition. It's a minor efficiency and consistency issue at most.
  The commit is a good engineering practice to ensure consistent structure layout across different architectures, but it does not address any security vulnerability and therefore should not receive a CVE assignment.
471db2c2d4f80 drm/scheduler: signal scheduled fence when kill job
- [sasha] **YES**
  This commit fixes a critical denial-of-service vulnerability where applications can hang indefinitely when their GPU job dependencies are on killed entities. The missing `drm_sched_fence_scheduled()` call in `drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work()` creates a deadlock scenario where:
  1. Application A's job depends on Application B's scheduled fence
  2. When Application B is killed, its jobs are removed but scheduled fences remain unsignaled  
  3. Application A hangs forever waiting for the dependency
  This enables cross-process DoS attacks where a malicious application can intentionally create dependencies and then crash to freeze other applications' GPU workloads. The vulnerability affects a core kernel subsystem (DRM scheduler) used by all GPU drivers, has a simple trigger mechanism, and causes persistent resource exhaustion requiring manual intervention.
a359288ccb4dd drm/amdgpu: seq64 memory unmap uses uninterruptible lock
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. When DRM_EXEC_INTERRUPTIBLE_WAIT is used, the lock operation can be interrupted by signals, which can cause it to fail with -EINTR. In the cleanup path (amdgpu_driver_postclose_kms), if a signal interrupts the lock acquisition, the seq64 unmapping would fail, leaving a memory leak.
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a resource leak issue, not a security vulnerability. The issue is:
  1. **Nature of the bug**: This is a memory/resource leak that occurs during normal operation when a process receives a signal during DRM file close. The seq64 VA mapping remains active when it should be cleaned up.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The leak happens within the context of a single process closing its DRM file descriptor. There's no privilege escalation, no unauthorized access to memory, and no ability to affect other processes.
  3. **Limited impact**: The impact is limited to a resource leak (VA mapping) that would eventually be cleaned up when the VM is destroyed. The "still active bo inside vm" error message is just a warning about improper cleanup ordering.
  4. **Trigger conditions**: This only happens when a signal is delivered at the exact moment the cleanup code is trying to acquire locks during file close - a relatively rare race condition in normal operation.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at similar commits like commit 1 and 2 (both marked "CVE Status: NO"), they also deal with cleanup/unmapping issues in the AMD GPU driver but were not assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  The change from `DRM_EXEC_INTERRUPTIBLE_WAIT` to `0` (uninterruptible) ensures the cleanup always completes successfully, preventing the resource leak, but this is a reliability/correctness fix rather than a security fix.
1e46ed947ec65 bcache: fix NULL pointer in cache_set_flush()
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **NULL pointer dereference vulnerability**: The commit fixes a kernel NULL pointer dereference at offset 0x9f8 (attempting to access ca->alloc_thread when ca is NULL), which causes a kernel crash.
  2. **Exploitable condition**: The vulnerability can be triggered during bcache device registration when memory allocation fails in bch_cache_set_alloc(). The error path calls bch_cache_set_unregister() → bch_cache_set_stop() → cache_set_flush(), where ca (assigned from c->cache) is accessed without checking if it's NULL.
  3. **Security impact**: This vulnerability leads to a kernel panic/crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The crash trace shows "BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000000000009f8" with the system becoming unresponsive.
  4. **Real-world occurrence**: The commit includes an actual kernel crash log showing this vulnerability was encountered in production (kernel 4.18.0-147.5.1.el8_1.5es.3.x86_64).
  5. **Pattern similarity**: This follows the same pattern as the similar commits marked "CVE Status: YES" - fixing NULL pointer dereferences that can cause kernel crashes, particularly in error handling paths.
  The fix properly adds a NULL check (if (ca && ca->alloc_thread)) before accessing ca->alloc_thread in cache_set_flush(), preventing the kernel crash when ca is NULL due to the early allocation failure path.
d9e688b9148bb drm/amdgpu/vcn2.5: read back register after written
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. This is about ensuring register writes are properly flushed to hardware before proceeding. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: The commit adds register read-backs after write operations to ensure the writes are properly flushed to hardware. This is a standard hardware programming practice to prevent write posting issues, not a security vulnerability fix.
  2. **Type of race condition**: The "race conditions" mentioned are hardware timing issues between register writes and subsequent operations (like doorbell writes), not software race conditions that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The comment from the vcn1 commit clarifies this is "standard PCI MMIO behavior, i.e. readback post all writes to let the writes hit the hardware".
  3. **Preventive measure**: As stated in the vcn1 commit message, "such issues have not been observed yet" and "This change ensures consistency across different VCN variants and helps avoid similar issues." This indicates it's a preventive measure for robustness, not a fix for an exploitable vulnerability.
  4. **Impact**: The lack of these read-backs could potentially cause hardware initialization or state transition issues, but there's no indication of memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security impacts.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: Looking at the similar commits marked as "CVE Status: NO", particularly the JPEG v4.0.3 register write fix and the MMR_READ IOCTL blocking during reset, those also dealt with proper hardware state management without security implications.
  The commit improves hardware reliability and prevents potential timing issues, but does not fix a security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
b7a4842a917e3 drm/amdgpu/vcn3: read back register after written
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and its context, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  **Reasoning:**
  1. **Preventive measure, not a fix for an existing vulnerability**: The commit message explicitly states these readbacks are "intended to prevent potential race conditions" and that "such issues have not been observed yet" (from the vcn1 commit). This is a defensive programming practice to ensure hardware register writes complete before proceeding.
  2. **Hardware timing issue, not a security vulnerability**: The race condition being prevented is a hardware timing issue where register writes may not complete before subsequent operations that depend on them. The readback forces synchronization by ensuring all posted writes to the hardware have completed.
  3. **No security impact described**: The original issue in VCN v4.0.5 was about WPTR (write pointer) not being updated correctly when starting from idle with doorbell usage. This is a functional correctness issue that could cause the video codec to malfunction, but there's no indication of:
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - System compromise
  4. **Similar to reference commits marked "CVE Status: NO"**: The pattern matches other driver register handling fixes in the reference commits that were not assigned CVEs.
  5. **Standard MMIO synchronization pattern**: Adding register readbacks after writes is a common pattern in device drivers to ensure posted writes complete. This is standard practice for MMIO operations and doesn't indicate a security issue.
  The commit improves driver reliability and prevents potential functional issues, but does not address any security vulnerabilities that would warrant a CVE assignment.
a3810a5e37c58 drm/amdgpu/vcn4: read back register after written
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. The changes add register read-backs after writes to prevent PCI write posting race conditions, which is a standard hardware programming pattern for ensuring write completion. The race conditions being addressed could only cause reliability issues like video decode failures or GPU hangs, not security vulnerabilities. There is no potential for privilege escalation, information disclosure, or memory corruption that could be exploited by an attacker. This is clearly a stability/reliability fix rather than a security fix.
bf394d28548c3 drm/amdgpu/vcn5.0.1: read back register after written
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the context:
  **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit adds register read-back operations after register writes to ensure all writes are completed before proceeding. This is a timing/synchronization improvement to prevent potential race conditions between hardware register writes.
  2. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The race conditions being prevented are hardware timing issues, not security vulnerabilities. The commit message explicitly states it's "intended to prevent potential race conditions" - meaning it's a preventive measure for reliability, not fixing an exploitable security issue.
  3. **Similar pattern across VCN versions**: This same pattern has been applied across multiple VCN versions (v2.0, v2.5, v3.0, v4.0, v4.0.3, v4.0.5, v5.0, v5.0.1) as shown in the git history. This indicates it's a systematic improvement for hardware reliability rather than fixing a specific security vulnerability.
  4. **Hardware register synchronization**: The fix adds `RREG32_SOC15(VCN, vcn_inst, regUVD_STATUS)` calls after critical register write sequences. This is a common hardware programming pattern to ensure write operations are flushed from any write buffers before continuing - it's about ensuring proper hardware state synchronization.
  5. **No security impact mentioned**: Unlike actual security fixes that typically mention memory corruption, privilege escalation, or data exposure risks, this commit only mentions preventing "race conditions" in a hardware programming context.
  6. **Comparison with similar commits marked "NO CVE"**: The similar commits shown in the reference (like the AMD GPU commits blocking MMR_READ IOCTL or adding skip_hw_access checks) also deal with hardware register access patterns but were marked as not requiring CVEs.
  This is a reliability/stability improvement for proper hardware initialization and shutdown sequences, not a security vulnerability fix.
90237b16ec1d7 amd/amdkfd: fix a kfd_process ref leak
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Simple Reference Counting Bug**: This is a straightforward reference counting error where `kfd_lookup_process_by_pasid()` returns a process with an incremented reference count (line 1845 in kfd_process.c shows `kref_get(&ret_p->process->ref)`), but on the error path when `kfd_process_get_user_gpu_id()` fails, the code was returning without calling `kfd_unref_process()` to decrement the reference.
  2. **Limited Security Impact**: While this is a resource leak that could theoretically lead to memory exhaustion over time, it requires:
     - A specific error condition (kfd_process_get_user_gpu_id returning -EINVAL)
     - The error path is only triggered when the user_gpu_id lookup fails, which is an unusual condition
     - The function is handling poison consumption events (hardware ECC errors), not user-controlled input
  3. **Not Exploitable**: This leak:
     - Cannot be directly triggered by unprivileged users
     - Occurs only in error handling paths during hardware exception events
     - Does not lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other direct security impacts
     - Would require many hardware error events to accumulate significant memory usage
  4. **Comparison with Similar Commits**: Looking at the historical commits with CVE status:
     - The commits marked "CVE Status: YES" (like 18921b205012) fixed leaks that could be triggered during normal operations or user-initiated actions
     - This commit fixes a leak only in a rare error path during hardware exception handling
  The fix is correct and important for system stability, but it doesn't meet the threshold for a security vulnerability requiring a CVE assignment.
2afe17794cfed md/md-bitmap: fix dm-raid max_write_behind setting
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a configuration boundary check issue in dm-raid's max_write_behind setting. The change corrects the validation check from `if (write_behind > COUNTER_MAX)` to `if (write_behind > COUNTER_MAX / 2)`.
  Key observations:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a configuration validation issue. The write_behind parameter controls how many writes can be outstanding in RAID1 before synchronization. Using COUNTER_MAX instead of COUNTER_MAX/2 doesn't create a security vulnerability.
  2. **No memory corruption or overflow**: With COUNTER_BITS = 16, COUNTER_MAX is approximately 16383. The incorrect check allowed values up to COUNTER_MAX when they should have been limited to COUNTER_MAX/2. This doesn't cause buffer overflows or memory corruption.
  3. **Limited impact**: The write_behind parameter affects performance characteristics of RAID1 write operations, not security boundaries. The comment even states the choice of COUNTER_MAX/2 is "arbitrary".
  4. **No privilege escalation or data exposure**: This configuration issue doesn't enable unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or information disclosure.
  5. **Configuration correctness**: This is a bug fix that ensures the configuration matches the intended design constraint mentioned in the comment, but exceeding the intended limit doesn't create exploitable conditions.
  While this is a legitimate bug fix, it lacks the security impact necessary for CVE assignment. It's a functional correctness issue rather than a security vulnerability.
0bf04c874fcb1 nvme-tcp: sanitize request list handling
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I can now provide my assessment.
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Security Vulnerability**: The commit explicitly mentions fixing a vulnerability where "a malicious R2T PDU might inject a loop in request list processing". This is a clear security issue where a malicious NVMe-TCP target could send crafted R2T (Ready To Transfer) PDUs to manipulate the driver's internal state.
  2. **Remote Attack Vector**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by a malicious NVMe-TCP target/server that the host is connected to. The R2T PDU is a network protocol message that comes from the remote target.
  3. **Potential Impact**: The vulnerability could lead to:
     - **Infinite loops** in request list processing, causing system hangs or denial of service
     - **Memory corruption** through list manipulation
     - **System instability** due to corrupted data structures
  4. **Code Analysis**: The fix adds validation in `nvme_tcp_handle_r2t()` at lines 775-781 to check if a request is already on a list before adding it again:
     ```c
     if (llist_on_list(&req->lentry) ||
         !list_empty(&req->entry)) {
         dev_err(queue->ctrl->ctrl.device,
             "req %d unexpected r2t while processing request\n",
             rq->tag);
         return -EPROTO;
     }
     ```
  5. **Similar to CVE-assigned commits**: This is similar to the second reference commit which received a CVE for fixing a memory corruption vulnerability in `nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()` where a malicious target could send invalid header lengths.
  The vulnerability allows a malicious NVMe-TCP target to send specially crafted R2T PDUs that could re-add already-listed requests to the processing queue, potentially creating circular references or corrupting the list structure. This is a classic case of insufficient input validation from untrusted network sources.
f42d4796ee100 nvme-tcp: fix I/O stalls on congested sockets
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Performance Fix, Not Security**: This commit fixes an I/O performance issue (stalls), not a security vulnerability. The issue is that when `nvme_tcp_try_recv()` returns -EAGAIN (socket temporarily unavailable), the code was incorrectly assuming that the send side was also blocked, leading to I/O stalls.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The changes:
     - Convert -EAGAIN to 0 in `nvme_tcp_try_recv()` to treat it as a non-error condition
     - Add an additional check to see if there are pending requests that can be sent when the socket becomes writable
     
     These changes don't fix any memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service vulnerabilities.
  3. **Normal Flow Control**: The -EAGAIN return value is a normal TCP flow control mechanism indicating the socket buffer is temporarily unavailable. The fix ensures the I/O work continues to check for sendable data even when receive returns -EAGAIN.
  4. **Similar to Non-CVE Commits**: This is similar to the "nvme-tcp: strict pdu pacing to avoid send stalls on TLS" commit which also addressed performance stalls but was not assigned a CVE.
  5. **No Fixes Tag**: Unlike security fixes that typically reference the commit that introduced the vulnerability with a "Fixes:" tag, this commit has no such reference, suggesting it's an optimization rather than fixing a security regression.
  The commit improves the driver's handling of congested network conditions but does not address any security vulnerability.
f81aa834bfa91 wifi: iwlwifi: mld: Move regulatory domain initialization
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  This commit is a timing/initialization order fix that does not address a security vulnerability. The changes simply move the regulatory domain initialization (`iwl_mld_init_mcc`) from `iwl_mld_load_fw` to `iwl_mld_start_fw`, ensuring it runs after the wiphy channels are configured.
  Key observations:
  1. **No memory safety issues**: The change doesn't fix any buffer overflows, use-after-free, or memory corruption vulnerabilities
  2. **No access control bypass**: This doesn't allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation
  3. **Functional correctness fix**: The issue is that regulatory domain was being set too early when channel information wasn't available, causing configuration mismatches
  4. **No exploitable condition**: A misconfigured regulatory domain might cause channels to be unavailable or improperly configured, but this is an operational issue, not a security vulnerability
  The commit message clearly describes this as an initialization ordering issue where "the regulatory domain was set to the wiphy, the channel information was not updated." This is a functional bug that could cause incorrect channel availability but does not present any security risk that could be exploited by an attacker.
ce0c43e855c7f PCI: imx6: Add workaround for errata ERR051624
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a hardware errata workaround (ERR051624) for a specific i.MX95 PCIe controller behavior, not a software vulnerability fix. The issue is that the controller cannot properly exit the L23 Ready power state when auxiliary power is not available.
  2. **No security impact**: The code change simply sets a bit (SYS_AUX_PWR_DET) in a hardware register to work around a hardware limitation. This doesn't fix any security vulnerability like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory leaks  
     - Access control issues
     - Input validation problems
     - Race conditions with security implications
  3. **Functional issue only**: The problem being addressed is a functional issue where the PCIe controller gets stuck in a low-power state (L23 Ready) and cannot wake up properly. This is a reliability/functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to other errata workarounds**: Looking at similar commits in the same driver (like commit 744a1c20ce93 for ERR051586), these are typical hardware errata workarounds that don't receive CVEs.
  5. **No exploitable condition**: There's no indication that this hardware behavior could be exploited by an attacker to cause denial of service, gain privileges, or access sensitive information.
  The commit is simply implementing a vendor-recommended hardware workaround by setting a register bit during initialization to prevent the controller from getting stuck in a power state.
7fa9fbf39116b PCI: apple: Fix missing OF node reference in apple_pcie_setup_port
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and the kernel code, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit does not fix a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **Resource leak, not security issue**: The commit fixes a missing reference count increment (`of_node_get()`) for a device tree node. While this is a bug that could lead to a use-after-free of the OF node structure, it does not have direct security implications.
  2. **Context of the bug**: The `for_each_available_child_of_node_scoped()` macro uses the `__free(device_node)` cleanup attribute which automatically calls `of_node_put()` when the loop variable goes out of scope. The function stores the node pointer in `port->np` and uses it later (in interrupt handlers), but without taking a reference, the node could be freed prematurely.
  3. **Limited impact**: This is a reference counting bug in device initialization code that:
     - Only affects Apple PCIe controller initialization
     - Occurs during boot/probe time
     - Would likely cause a crash/oops rather than exploitable behavior
     - Requires specific hardware (Apple M1/M2 systems)
  4. **Comparison to similar commits**: Looking at the CVE-assigned similar commits, they typically involve:
     - Network drivers with potential remote triggers
     - More widely-used subsystems
     - Clear paths to memory corruption or information disclosure
  This fix is more akin to the first similar commit (brcmstb PCIe) which also fixed a missing `of_node_put()` and was marked "CVE Status: NO".
af3c6eacce0c4 PCI: dwc: Make link training more robust by setting PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH to one lane
- [sasha] Now let me analyze the security implications based on what I've found:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is a robustness improvement for PCIe link training, not a fix for a security vulnerability. The change makes link training more reliable by always setting PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH to 1 lane initially, which helps ensure the link can be established even if some lanes are faulty.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes show that instead of setting PORT_LOGIC_LINK_WIDTH to match the actual number of lanes (2, 4, or 8), it now always sets it to 1. This is a functional change that affects how the PCIe link state machine (LTSSM) handles link training, but it doesn't introduce or fix any security issues like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Access control bypasses
  3. **Availability improvement, not a DoS fix**: While the commit does improve link establishment reliability (which could be considered an availability improvement), it's not fixing a denial-of-service vulnerability. The original behavior wasn't a security flaw - it was just less robust in certain hardware configurations where not all lanes might be functional.
  4. **Hardware configuration issue**: The commit addresses a hardware-specific behavior where all lanes must receive training sequences for the link to come up. This is a functional/compatibility issue, not a security vulnerability.
  5. **Similar to reference commits**: The similar commits provided (CVE Status: NO) also deal with PCIe link training improvements and configuration adjustments, none of which were assigned CVEs because they don't fix security vulnerabilities.
  The commit improves robustness and compatibility but doesn't address any security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
7e01511443c30 dmaengine: xilinx_dma: Set dma_device directions
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit does not warrant a CVE assignment. The change simply adds initialization of the `directions` field in the DMA device structure (`xdev->common.directions |= chan->direction`), which is required for the `dma_get_slave_caps()` function to work properly. 
  This is a functional fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The missing initialization prevented the driver from being used with certain subsystems (like IIO DMAEngine buffers) because capability queries would fail, but it did not create any security vulnerabilities. The driver was already properly enforcing transfer directions through the existing `chan->direction` field - this change just makes that information available to the DMA framework's capability reporting mechanism.
  The fail-safe nature of this bug (returning -ENXIO on capability queries) and the lack of any exploitable conditions (no memory corruption, privilege escalation, or access control bypass) confirm this is not a security issue requiring a CVE.
17502e7d7b711 dmaengine: idxd: Check availability of workqueue allocated by idxd wq driver before using
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and surrounding code:
  **YES**
  This commit should be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Kernel Panic/Crash Impact**: The commit message explicitly states this can "trigger a call trace or even a kernel panic" - this is a denial of service vulnerability that can crash the entire system.
  2. **Use-After-Free Pattern**: The vulnerability involves a race condition where `wq->wq` is destroyed (set to NULL in `idxd_user_drv_remove()`) but then accessed in `idxd_cdev_evl_drain_pasid()` without checking if it's NULL. This results in calling `drain_workqueue()` on a NULL pointer.
  3. **Race Condition**: The issue occurs in a specific containerized environment where the parent process termination creates a timing window between:
     - The workqueue being destroyed in `idxd_user_drv_remove()` 
     - The file release path in `idxd_file_dev_release()` trying to drain that workqueue
  4. **Security Context**: This affects the Intel Data Accelerator (IDXD) driver which handles DMA operations and PASID-based user submissions - a sensitive component that could be exploited by malicious containers.
  5. **Simple Fix Pattern**: The fix adds a NULL check before calling `drain_workqueue()`, which is a classic pattern for fixing use-after-free/NULL dereference vulnerabilities.
  The vulnerability allows unprivileged container processes to potentially crash the host kernel, making it a security issue worthy of CVE assignment.
977c4308ee427 rust: arm: fix unknown (to Clang) argument '-mno-fdpic'
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide a determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a build system fix that adds `-mno-fdpic` to the `bindgen_skip_c_flags` list. This means the flag will be filtered out when passing flags to Clang/bindgen since Clang doesn't recognize this GCC-specific flag.
  2. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit fixes a build failure, not a security vulnerability. The error was simply that Clang doesn't recognize the `-mno-fdpic` flag that GCC uses, causing the Rust build to fail with "error: unknown argument: '-mno-fdpic'".
  3. **FDPIC context**: FDPIC (Position Independent Code for FDPIC ABI) is related to no-MMU systems and is primarily used for userspace programs. As noted in the commit message and the original ARM commit (3d47ff25685e), the kernel explicitly disables FDPIC since it's not meant to be used for kernel builds.
  4. **Build compatibility fix**: This is purely a toolchain compatibility fix to allow Rust code to build on ARM when using Clang/bindgen. The flag is simply added to the skip list so it won't be passed to Clang, which doesn't support it anyway.
  5. **No security impact**: There's no memory corruption, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or any other security-relevant issue being fixed. The change only affects the build process, not runtime behavior.
  The similar commits analyzed also show a pattern of build/toolchain fixes rather than security fixes, which aligns with this assessment.
249c3a0e53ace rust: module: place cleanup_module() in .exit.text section
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit only changes the section placement of the `cleanup_module()` function from `.text` to `.exit.text` by adding the `#[link_section = ".exit.text"]` attribute. This is purely a binary layout change to maintain consistency with C modules, with no functional or security implications. The code itself remains unchanged - it's just being placed in a different section of the compiled binary. The `.exit.text` section is a standard kernel section used for module cleanup code, and this change has no impact on memory safety, access control, or any other security-relevant behavior.
571781eb7ffef ksmbd: provide zero as a unique ID to the Mac client
- [sasha] **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. It's a compatibility workaround for Mac SMB clients that incorrectly expect file IDs to be globally unique (like HFS+ CNIDs) rather than unique per filesystem. The change simply returns UniqueId=0 for Mac clients (identified by AAPL context) to tell them to ignore server file IDs. This addresses a client-side bug where Mac clients error out on valid duplicate inode numbers in btrfs subvolumes or ZFS, but introduces no security vulnerabilities - no access control bypass, no data corruption risk, no authentication issues, or any other security-relevant problems.
dc3e0f17f7455 ksmbd: allow a filename to contain special characters on SMB3.1.1 posix extension
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I'll provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Feature Enhancement, Not a Security Fix**: The commit is implementing proper SMB3.1.1 POSIX extension behavior by allowing special characters in filenames when the POSIX context is explicitly requested by the client. This is not fixing a vulnerability but rather implementing correct protocol behavior.
  2. **Security Controls Remain in Place**: The code still validates filenames when POSIX context is NOT present (`if (posix_ctxt == false)`). The validation function `ksmbd_validate_filename()` blocks dangerous characters including control characters (0x00-0x1f), wildcards ('?', '*'), and shell metacharacters ('<', '>', '|', '"').
  3. **Opt-in Behavior**: The special character allowance only happens when:
     - The client explicitly sends SMB2_CREATE_POSIX_CONTEXT
     - The server has POSIX extensions enabled (`tcon->posix_extensions`)
     - This is expected behavior for POSIX-compliant systems
  4. **No Security Boundary Crossed**: The change doesn't introduce path traversal, buffer overflows, or other security vulnerabilities. It simply allows POSIX-compliant filenames when operating in POSIX mode, which is the expected behavior according to the SMB3 POSIX extensions specification.
  5. **Similar Pattern to Reference Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the POSIX-related changes (implementing POSIX types, handling special files/symlinks, fixing POSIX mounts) were assigned CVEs as they were feature implementations or compatibility fixes rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a legitimate feature implementation that aligns with the SMB3.1.1 POSIX extension specification, allowing Unix/Linux systems to properly handle filenames with special characters when operating in POSIX mode.
19932f844f3f5 hwmon: (pmbus/max34440) Fix support for max34451
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and code changes, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Hardware quirk fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes support for a newer hardware revision (MAX34451ETNA6+) that corrected a hardware issue where IOUT_OC_WARN_LIMIT and IOUT_OC_FAULT_LIMIT registers were swapped compared to the PMBus specification. This is a hardware compatibility fix, not a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security impact**: The code changes involve:
     - Adding dynamic register address mapping based on hardware revision
     - Adding support for additional monitoring capabilities (VIN/IIN) in newer hardware
     - The swapped registers only affect overcurrent warning and fault limits for monitoring purposes
  3. **No exploitable condition**: The issue being fixed is that older hardware versions had registers at non-standard addresses. Using the wrong addresses would simply result in incorrect monitoring values or configuration failures, not any security vulnerability like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or unauthorized access.
  4. **Similar to other hwmon fixes**: Looking at the similar commits provided as reference (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), this follows the same pattern of hardware compatibility fixes, missing dependencies, and register mapping corrections that are not security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a functional fix to properly support different hardware revisions of the MAX34451 power monitoring chip, ensuring correct register addressing based on the chip revision. This is a typical hardware driver maintenance update without security implications.
6e9a2f8dbe93c NFSv4: xattr handlers should check for absent nfs filehandles
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  **Explanation:**
  1. **No Security Vulnerability**: This commit fixes a user experience issue where accessing xattrs on NFS referral anchors (which have zero-length filehandles) returns `-EIO` (I/O error) instead of the more appropriate `-ENODATA` (No data available). This is purely a error code correction, not a security fix.
  2. **No Privilege Escalation or Access Control Bypass**: The code changes simply add checks for zero-length filehandles and return `-ENODATA` immediately instead of attempting to send a malformed request to the NFS server. This doesn't grant any unauthorized access or bypass any security controls.
  3. **No Information Disclosure**: The change doesn't expose any sensitive information. It actually prevents sending invalid requests to the server that would fail anyway.
  4. **Expected Behavior**: NFS referral anchors are special inodes that represent mount points that haven't been followed yet. Having no filehandle is their expected state, and attempting to get/set ACLs on them should appropriately indicate no data is available.
  5. **Error Handling Improvement**: The commit improves error handling by returning a more semantically correct error code (`-ENODATA` instead of `-EIO`). This helps applications better understand why the operation failed.
  The similar commits provided as reference (CB_GETATTR implementation, filehandle aliasing tracking, ACL handling) were also not assigned CVEs because they were feature additions or non-security bug fixes. This commit follows the same pattern - it's a quality improvement that makes the error reporting more accurate but doesn't fix any security vulnerability.
ce32b0c9c522e cxl: core/region - ignore interleave granularity when ways=1
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Nature of the change**: This is a validation relaxation, not a security fix. The change modifies line 1460 to only check interleave granularity (`ig`) when interleave ways (`iw`) is greater than 1:
     ```c
     - cxld->interleave_granularity != ig ||
     + (iw > 1 && cxld->interleave_granularity != ig) ||
     ```
  2. **Technical justification**: When `iw=1` (single interleave way), there's only one target, so all memory accesses will route to that single target regardless of the granularity setting. The interleave granularity becomes irrelevant in this case, making the validation unnecessarily strict.
  3. **No security vulnerability fixed**: The commit message clearly states this is to handle a compatibility issue with Zen5 platforms where BIOS specifies certain configurations that were previously rejected by Linux. This is about enabling valid hardware configurations, not fixing a security issue.
  4. **No exploitable conditions**: The change doesn't fix any of the typical security issues we see in the similar commits:
     - No null pointer dereference 
     - No buffer overflow
     - No use-after-free
     - No privilege escalation
     - No information disclosure
  5. **Comparison with CVE-assigned commits**: Looking at similar commit 3 (which has CVE status YES), it fixes a null pointer dereference - a clear security issue that could cause kernel crashes. This commit has no such security implications.
  6. **Impact**: The worst case scenario before this patch was that valid hardware configurations would be rejected, leading to inability to create CXL regions on certain platforms. This is a functionality issue, not a security vulnerability.
  This is a functional improvement/compatibility fix rather than a security fix, and therefore does not warrant a CVE assignment.
d90acdf49e180 cxl/region: Add a dev_err() on missing target list entries
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here is my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The code change only adds an error message (`dev_err()`) to improve diagnostics when a target list entry is missing. The actual error condition (`rc = -ENXIO`) was already being properly handled and returned before this change.
  2. **No security impact**: The change is purely diagnostic - it adds logging to help developers debug configuration issues but doesn't fix any security vulnerability like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Memory corruption
     - Privilege escalation
     - Information disclosure
     - Denial of service
  3. **Error path already existed**: Looking at the code, when `find_pos_and_ways()` fails to find the port in the target list, it was already returning `-ENXIO`. The calling function `cxl_calc_interleave_pos()` propagates this error, and eventually `cxl_region_sort_targets()` handles it appropriately.
  4. **Configuration/initialization issue**: The commit message explicitly states this is about "Broken target lists are hard to discover as the driver fails at a later initialization stage." This is a usability/debugging improvement for configuration issues, not a security fix.
  5. **Similar to logging improvements**: Unlike the CVE-assigned commits shown as examples (which fixed NULL pointer dereferences, use-after-free bugs, and decoder allocation crashes), this commit merely adds logging to an existing error path.
  The change improves debuggability but does not address any security vulnerability.
69efbff69f89c fuse: fix race between concurrent setattrs from multiple nodes
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I need to determine if this qualifies for a CVE assignment. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit fixes a race condition in FUSE that causes stale inode attributes to be cached when concurrent setattr operations occur from multiple nodes in a distributed filesystem setup. While this is a bug that can lead to incorrect file metadata being cached, it does not represent a security vulnerability that warrants a CVE assignment for the following reasons:
  1. **No security boundary violation**: The race condition only affects the caching of file attributes (like permissions, ownership, timestamps) between different client nodes mounting the same FUSE filesystem. It doesn't allow bypassing access controls or escalating privileges.
  2. **Limited impact**: The issue results in stale metadata being temporarily cached, which would eventually be corrected on the next getattr() call. The worst case is temporary inconsistency in file attributes across nodes, not a security compromise.
  3. **No data corruption or disclosure**: The bug affects only metadata caching, not file content. There's no risk of data corruption, unauthorized data access, or information disclosure.
  4. **Functional correctness issue**: This is primarily a distributed system consistency problem rather than a security vulnerability. The fix ensures that when the server invalidates cached attributes via fuse_reverse_inval_inode(), those attributes are properly marked as invalid even if a concurrent setattr operation is in progress.
  5. **Similar to non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, other FUSE race condition fixes and attribute handling improvements (like commits 1 and 2) were marked as "CVE Status: NO", indicating that attribute caching issues in FUSE are generally not considered security vulnerabilities.
  The fix works by capturing the attr_version before the setattr request and checking if it has been incremented by fuse_reverse_inval_inode() during the request's lifetime. If so, it sets the attribute timeout to zero, forcing a refresh on the next access.
e35ca991a777e leds: multicolor: Fix intensity setting while SW blinking
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my analysis:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: This is a functional bug fix that addresses inconsistent behavior when writing to the `multi_intensity` sysfs file while LED blinking is active. The issue is that writing intensity values would stop the blinking if it happened during the "off" phase.
  2. **No security vulnerability**: The commit does not fix any security vulnerability. There is:
     - No memory corruption or buffer overflow
     - No privilege escalation
     - No unauthorized access or information disclosure
     - No input validation issues that could be exploited
     - No race condition that leads to security issues
  3. **Limited impact**: The worst case scenario is that LED blinking stops unexpectedly when changing intensity values - this is a cosmetic/functional issue, not a security issue.
  4. **Code analysis**: The change simply adds a check for `LED_BLINK_SW` flag before calling `led_set_brightness()`. This ensures that during software blinking, the intensity changes are applied at the next blink cycle rather than immediately, maintaining consistent behavior with monochrome LEDs.
  5. **Similar commits**: Looking at the historical similar commits provided (all marked "CVE Status: NO"), they deal with LED timing, brightness races, and trigger issues - none were assigned CVEs because they don't represent security vulnerabilities.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that improves the LED subsystem's behavior consistency, but it does not address any security vulnerability that would warrant a CVE assignment.
3da732687d720 dm vdo indexer: don't read request structure after enqueuing
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **No Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly states "This can not currently cause problems, due to the way request processing is handled, but it is not safe in general." This indicates it's a defensive programming fix, not an actual vulnerability fix.
  2. **Preventive Code Cleanup**: The change is reading `request->zone_number` into a local variable before potentially enqueuing the request for asynchronous processing. This is a best practice to avoid potential race conditions, but there's no indication of an exploitable vulnerability.
  3. **Pattern Analysis**: The code changes show:
     - Creating local variable: `unsigned int zone_number = request->zone_number;`
     - Using the local variable instead of dereferencing the request pointer after `enqueue_page_read()`
     - This prevents reading from a request structure that might be processed by another thread
  4. **No Actual Race Condition**: The commit message indicates this is preventive - the current implementation doesn't actually have the race condition due to how request processing works, but the code is being made more robust for future changes.
  5. **Similar to Commit 1**: This is similar to the first reference commit which was marked "CVE Status: NO" - it's a code cleanup/safety improvement rather than a security vulnerability fix.
  The commit improves code safety by following the principle of not accessing data structures after they've been passed to another thread for processing, but it doesn't fix an actual security vulnerability that could be exploited.
b2446a16dbf23 hwmon: (isl28022) Fix current reading calculation
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Functional bug fix, not a security vulnerability**: The commit fixes an incorrect calculation in the current reading function where negative values were not properly handled due to incorrect sign extension. This results in incorrect sensor readings but does not create a security vulnerability.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The bug only affects the accuracy of hardware monitoring readings. It doesn't allow privilege escalation, memory corruption, information disclosure of sensitive data, or any other security-relevant impact.
  3. **Limited scope and impact**: The issue is confined to the `isl28022_read_current()` function and only affects how current values are calculated and reported to userspace through the hwmon interface. Incorrect sensor readings, while problematic for monitoring, don't constitute a security vulnerability.
  4. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (tmp513, pt5161l, tps23861), they all fix similar calculation/interpretation issues in hwmon drivers and were marked as "CVE Status: NO". These commits fixed:
     - Sign extension errors in temperature/current readings
     - Off-by-one errors in bit indices
     - Type casting issues causing incorrect negative value handling
  5. **No attack vector**: There's no way for an attacker to exploit this bug to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise system integrity. It's purely a functional correctness issue.
  The code change shows the fix properly implements two's complement handling for negative current values by extracting the sign bit and applying the correct calculation, which is consistent with other similar fixes in the hwmon subsystem that handle sensor data interpretation.
fadc0f3bb2de8 sunrpc: don't immediately retransmit on seqno miss
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, I'll provide my assessment:
  **NO** - This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: This commit is a performance optimization that changes retransmission behavior. It doesn't fix a security vulnerability but rather addresses excessive retransmissions that occur when a server is slow to respond.
  2. **No security impact**: The commit changes how the client handles RPCSEC_GSS sequence number mismatches from immediate retransmission to waiting for normal timeout. This is a behavioral change that:
     - Doesn't expose sensitive data
     - Doesn't enable unauthorized access
     - Doesn't cause memory corruption or leaks
     - Doesn't create DoS vulnerabilities
  3. **Performance improvement, not security fix**: The commit explicitly describes the problem as "wasted retransmits" when servers are slow. The change makes the client wait for normal timeout instead of immediately retransmitting, which is a performance optimization.
  4. **Error handling refinement**: The code change in the `-EACCES` case (lines 2773-2780) simply changes from falling through to retransmit immediately to resetting receive state and waiting. This is a refinement of error handling logic, not a security fix.
  5. **Context from similar commits**: Looking at the CVE-assigned commits in the examples, they all fixed actual security issues:
     - Memory leaks that could lead to exhaustion
     - Race conditions with NULL pointer access
     - Resource management issues
  This commit doesn't exhibit any of these security-relevant patterns. It's a legitimate performance optimization that reduces unnecessary network traffic without introducing or fixing security vulnerabilities.
37ef4aa4039c4 mfd: sprd-sc27xx: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparing it to similar commits, here's my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Nature of the leak**: This is a wakeup source memory leak that occurs only when the device is unbound. The leaked memory is small (just the wakeup source structure containing a name, ID, and some statistics).
  2. **Triggering conditions**: Device unbinding typically requires privileged access (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) through sysfs or module unloading. An unprivileged user cannot trigger this leak.
  3. **Impact**: The memory leak is minimal and would require many unbind operations to have any significant impact. The device is a PMIC (Power Management IC) that is typically bound once at boot and rarely if ever unbound during normal operation.
  4. **Pattern matching**: All the similar commits fixing wakeup source leaks (gpio-mpc8xxx, gpio-zynq, timer-stm32-lp, etc.) were marked as NOT needing CVEs. These fixes follow the same pattern: replacing `device_init_wakeup()` with `devm_device_init_wakeup()` to ensure automatic cleanup.
  5. **Comparison to CVE-assigned commit**: The pm8001 commit that received a CVE was fundamentally different - it was a memory leak in an error path that could potentially be triggered more easily and leaked a larger fw_control_context structure in a SCSI driver context.
  The fix properly converts from manual to managed (devm) resource allocation, ensuring the wakeup source is automatically freed when the device is removed. This is a good practice fix but does not address a security vulnerability.
6d0b2398b2638 mfd: 88pm886: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, I can now provide my assessment:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. The fix addresses a resource leak (memory allocated for wakeup source) that occurs when a device is unbound, but this is not a security vulnerability. Here's why:
  1. **No security impact**: The leaked memory from `wakeup_source_create()` (which allocates a `struct wakeup_source` via `kzalloc()`) is a simple resource management issue. It doesn't expose sensitive data, allow privilege escalation, or create exploitable conditions.
  2. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: This fix follows the exact same pattern as similar commits 1-3 in the reference list (gpio-mpc8xxx, gpio-zynq, timer-stm32-lp), all marked as "CVE Status: NO". They all replace `device_init_wakeup()` with `devm_device_init_wakeup()` to ensure proper cleanup on device unbind.
  3. **Limited impact**: The leak only occurs during device unbind operations, which are typically administrative actions. The leaked memory is small (struct wakeup_source + string for name) and doesn't accumulate under normal operation.
  4. **Different from CVE-worthy commits**: Unlike commits 4-5 which got CVEs (mt7921 and pm8001), this commit doesn't fix issues that could lead to system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service under attacker control.
  The change simply ensures proper resource cleanup using the devm (device-managed) API, which automatically releases resources when the device is removed - a best practice but not a security vulnerability.
a59a56cc4fb1f mfd: max77705: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit and comparing it with similar commits:
  **NO**
  This commit should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Memory leak, not security vulnerability**: The commit fixes a memory leak that occurs when the device is unbound. When `device_init_wakeup(dev, true)` is called, it allocates a wakeup source object via `wakeup_source_register()`. Without proper cleanup on unbind, this memory is leaked.
  2. **No security impact**: The leak only occurs during device unbind operations, which are typically administrative actions (like module unloading). This doesn't create:
     - No privilege escalation opportunity
     - No information disclosure
     - No denial of service (beyond minimal memory waste)
     - No remote exploitation vector
  3. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (gpio: mpc8xxx, gpio: zynq, clocksource: stm32-lptimer), all fixing similar wakeup source leaks, none were assigned CVEs. These are all quality/resource management fixes.
  4. **Limited impact**: The fix changes from `device_init_wakeup()` to `devm_device_init_wakeup()`, which automatically handles cleanup when the device is removed. This is a standard resource management pattern in Linux drivers.
  5. **Requires physical access**: Device unbinding typically requires root privileges and is not a common operation during normal system use.
  The commit that was assigned a CVE (mt76: mt7921s memory leak) was different - it fixed a memory leak in a normal operational path that could be triggered repeatedly, potentially leading to memory exhaustion. This max77705 fix addresses a leak only on device unbind, which is an infrequent administrative operation.
d905d06e64b0e mfd: max14577: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis, here's my determination:
  **NO** - This commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Explanation:
  1. **Nature of the issue**: This is a memory leak that occurs only during device unbind/remove operations. The `device_init_wakeup(dev, 1)` call in the probe function allocates a `wakeup_source` structure (via `wakeup_source_create()` which calls `kzalloc()`), but the remove function was not freeing this memory by calling `device_init_wakeup(dev, false)`.
  2. **Limited security impact**: 
     - The leak only occurs when the device is explicitly unbound/removed, which is typically an administrative operation requiring root privileges
     - It's a small memory leak (sizeof(struct wakeup_source) + string for device name)
     - It cannot be triggered remotely or by unprivileged users
     - There's no data corruption, privilege escalation, or system crash potential
  3. **Comparison with similar commits**:
     - The similar commits for gpio-mpc8xxx and gpio-zynq (marked as "CVE Status: NO") fix the exact same type of wakeup source leak
     - The pattern is identical: missing `device_init_wakeup(dev, false)` in the remove function
     - These were correctly not assigned CVEs
  4. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a resource management bug that causes minor memory leaks during device removal. It does not meet the criteria for a security vulnerability as it:
     - Cannot be exploited for malicious purposes
     - Requires privileged operations to trigger
     - Has minimal impact (small memory leak)
     - Does not affect system security or stability in any meaningful way
  The fix is correct and important for proper resource cleanup, but it addresses a quality issue rather than a security vulnerability.
6c7115cdf6440 mfd: max77541: Fix wakeup source leaks on device unbind
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: The change fixes a resource leak (wakeup source memory) that occurs only during device unbind/driver removal. This is a cleanup issue, not a security vulnerability that can be exploited.
  2. **Pattern matches non-CVE commits**: The commit follows the exact same pattern as Similar Commits 1, 2, and 4, all of which were marked "CVE Status: NO". These commits fix identical issues in different drivers (gpio-mpc8xxx, gpio-zynq, timer-stm32-lp) by replacing `device_init_wakeup()` with `devm_device_init_wakeup()`.
  3. **Resource management improvement**: The change switches from manual to automatic (devm) resource management. The `devm_device_init_wakeup()` function automatically calls `device_init_wakeup(dev, false)` when the device is removed, preventing the leak.
  4. **No security impact**: The wakeup source structure contains device management data (timers, lists, names) but no sensitive information. The leak doesn't expose memory contents to unprivileged users or allow privilege escalation.
  5. **Contrast with CVE-assigned commits**: The CVE-assigned commits (Similar Commits 3 and 5) involved:
     - Commit 3: Firmware loading path with potential for repeated allocations during normal operation
     - Commit 5: HID driver processing user-controllable data with memory allocation in frequently-called paths
  The max77541 driver's wakeup source leak only occurs during driver unbind, which is typically an administrative operation, not during normal device operation.
dddbd233e67e7 mailbox: Not protect module_put with spin_lock_irqsave
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of the commit and the surrounding code, I need to determine if this change introduces any security vulnerabilities.
  **NO**
  This commit does not introduce a security vulnerability and should not be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **No Use-After-Free Risk**: The commit moves `module_put()` outside the spinlock protection, but `chan->mbox` is never modified after initial channel setup in `mbox_controller_register()`. The pointer remains valid throughout the channel's lifetime.
  2. **Consistent Locking Pattern**: The commit message correctly notes that `try_module_get()` in `__mbox_bind_client()` is also not protected by `chan->lock`, making the locking pattern consistent between get/put operations.
  3. **Lock Purpose**: The `chan->lock` protects channel state (`chan->cl`, `chan->active_req`, `chan->txdone_method`) but not the controller structure (`chan->mbox`). The module reference count is tied to the controller, not the channel state.
  4. **No Race Condition**: After `mbox_free_channel()` clears `chan->cl` under the lock, no other code path can use this channel (they check `chan->cl` first). The `module_put()` happens after the channel is already marked as free.
  5. **Cleanup Operation**: This is purely a code cleanup that improves lock granularity by not holding the spinlock longer than necessary. The module unloading protection is maintained through proper reference counting, just with reduced lock contention.
  The change is similar to the non-security commits in the reference set (like commit 3 and 4) that involve code cleanup or fixing non-security issues rather than the security-critical commits (like commit 1, 2, and 5) that fix actual vulnerabilities with potential for exploitation.
aba41e90aadec NFSv4.2: fix setattr caching of TIME_[MODIFY|ACCESS]_SET when timestamps are delegated
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue better. Let me analyze the security implications:
  **NO**
  This commit is a performance optimization fix, not a security vulnerability fix. Here's why:
  1. **Nature of the fix**: The commit addresses a performance issue where NFS was unnecessarily flushing pending writes when setting fixed timestamps on files with delegated timestamp attributes. This was causing significant performance degradation (30% latency improvement after the fix).
  2. **No security implications**: The changes are:
     - Adding logic to distinguish between setting timestamps to "current time" vs setting them to a specific fixed time (ATTR_MTIME_SET/ATTR_ATIME_SET)
     - Avoiding unnecessary write flushes when timestamps are delegated and being set to fixed values
     - Correctly clearing attribute bits in the bitmask when communicating with the server
  3. **No vulnerability being fixed**: There's no:
     - Memory corruption or overflow
     - Privilege escalation
     - Access control bypass
     - Information disclosure
     - Race condition that could be exploited
     - Input validation issue
  4. **Similar commits analysis**: The other delegated timestamp commits shown in the similar commits list (which are marked as "CVE Status: NO") are also bug fixes and optimizations related to the delegated timestamps feature, not security fixes.
  5. **Feature context**: The delegated timestamps feature (introduced in commit e12912d94137) allows NFS clients to manage file timestamps locally when they hold certain delegations, improving performance by reducing server round-trips. This commit simply fixes a performance regression in that feature.
  The commit is purely a performance optimization that fixes inefficient behavior when handling timestamp updates on files with delegated attributes. It does not address any security vulnerability.
243fea134633b NFSv4.2: fix listxattr to return selinux security label
- [sasha] Based on my analysis:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability**: This is a functional bug where SELinux security labels were not being returned by `listxattr()` when `CONFIG_NFS_V4_SECURITY_LABEL` was disabled. The security labels could still be retrieved individually using `getxattr()` with the specific label name.
  2. **No security boundary violation**: The fix doesn't expose any information that wasn't already accessible - it just makes the labels visible in the complete attribute listing. Users could already query these labels directly.
  3. **Consistency fix**: This is fixing an inconsistency in the API behavior where `getfattr -n security.selinux` would work but `getfattr -d` would not show the label. This is a usability/functionality issue, not a security issue.
  4. **No privilege escalation or access control bypass**: The commit doesn't change any permission checks or allow unauthorized access to security labels.
  5. **Similar to past non-CVE commits**: Looking at the historical commits, the 2015 commit `c4803c497fbd` that moved `security_inode_listsecurity` around was also not assigned a CVE, as it was just reorganizing code for proper functionality.
  The only security-related commit in the similar examples that got a CVE was the memory leak fix (`aad11473f8f4`), which is a different class of issue that could potentially lead to resource exhaustion.
3a3065352f733 NFSv4: Always set NLINK even if the server doesn't support it
- [sasha] Now I understand the issue. Let me summarize my findings:
  **CVE Status: NO**
  This commit fixes a functional bug, not a security vulnerability. Here's my analysis:
  1. **What the commit fixes**: When an NFSv4 server doesn't support the `fattr4_numlinks` attribute (which is recommended but not mandatory), the NFS client was leaving `inode->i_nlink` as 0 instead of setting it to a default value of 1.
  2. **The impact**: With `i_nlink == 0`, the `nfs_lookup_verify_inode()` function returns `-ESTALE` (line 1582 in fs/nfs/dir.c), causing mount operations to fail with "Stale file handle" errors. This is a denial of service in terms of functionality, but not a security vulnerability.
  3. **Why it's not a security issue**:
     - This is a client-side issue that only affects the ability to mount NFS shares
     - It doesn't allow privilege escalation, information disclosure, or remote code execution
     - The failure mode is safe - it prevents access rather than allowing unauthorized access
     - It only occurs with specific NFSv4 servers that don't support a recommended attribute
     - The fix simply ensures proper initialization of a metadata field
  4. **Similar to reference commits**: The reference commits show similar patterns of fixing NFS client bugs related to file attributes, remounting, and error handling. None of these were assigned CVEs because they fix functional issues rather than security vulnerabilities.
  The commit ensures that even when servers don't provide the `numlinks` attribute, the client can still function correctly by using a sensible default value of 1 for the link count.
6510ef4230b68 cifs: Fix encoding of SMB1 Session Setup NTLMSSP Request in non-UNICODE mode
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE for the following reasons:
  1. **Not a security vulnerability fix**: The commit is fixing a functional issue where SMB1 Session Setup with NTLMSSP authentication failed in non-UNICODE mode. The old code simply returned -ENOSYS (function not implemented) when non-UNICODE mode was requested, preventing legitimate connections.
  2. **No security boundary crossed**: The change doesn't fix any security vulnerability like:
     - Buffer overflows
     - Authentication bypasses
     - Privilege escalations
     - Information disclosure
     - Memory corruption
  3. **Functionality extension**: The commit extends functionality to support ASCII-encoded strings in addition to UTF-16 encoded strings for NTLMSSP session setup. Both `ascii_oslm_strings()` and `unicode_oslm_strings()` functions already existed and simply encode OS/LAN Manager strings differently.
  4. **Error handling improvement**: The old code incorrectly assumed NTLMSSP always required UNICODE support and rejected non-UNICODE requests. The fix properly handles both UNICODE and non-UNICODE modes based on the `SMBFLG2_UNICODE` flag.
  5. **Similar to other non-CVE commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided (which all have "CVE Status: NO"), they also deal with encoding fixes, string handling improvements, and protocol compliance issues without security implications.
  The commit is a legitimate bug fix that enables proper SMB1 mounting with the `-o nounicode` option, but it doesn't address any security vulnerability.
a3e771afbb3bc cifs: Fix cifs_query_path_info() for Windows NT servers
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**, this commit should not be assigned a CVE.
  Here's my reasoning based on the code changes:
  1. **Nature of the Fix**: This is an interoperability fix, not a security vulnerability fix. The commit addresses a compatibility issue with Windows NT SMB servers that return error responses for TRANS2_QUERY_PATH_INFO requests without setting the SMBFLG_RESPONSE flag.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The change only relaxes the validation check in `check_smb_hdr()` for a specific case - when it's a TRANS2 command with an error status. This allows the Linux CIFS client to properly handle error responses from Windows NT servers for file operations like stat(), creat(), and mkdir().
  3. **Limited Scope**: The modification is very specific:
     - Only affects SMB_COM_TRANSACTION2 commands
     - Only when there's an error status (CifsError != 0)
     - Simply allows these packets to be accepted as valid responses
  4. **Functional Fix**: The commit message clearly states this fixes basic filesystem operations (stat, creat, mkdir) against Windows NT servers. Without this fix, these operations would fail because the client would reject valid error responses.
  5. **No Exploitation Vector**: There's no indication this could be exploited:
     - It doesn't introduce buffer overflows
     - It doesn't bypass authentication or access controls
     - It doesn't allow unauthorized data access
     - It simply allows proper error handling for legitimate SMB protocol responses
  6. **Similar to Other Non-CVE Commits**: Looking at the similar commits provided, none of the interoperability fixes or protocol handling improvements received CVEs. Only commits that fixed actual security vulnerabilities (like the OOB read in smbCalcSize - CVE-2023-6606) received CVEs.
  This is a straightforward protocol compatibility fix that enables proper communication with older Windows NT servers, not a security vulnerability.
89381c72d5209 cifs: Correctly set SMB1 SessionKey field in Session Setup Request
- [sasha] Based on my analysis of this commit, here is my determination:
  **NO**
  This commit should NOT be assigned a CVE. Here's why:
  1. **Protocol Compliance Fix Only**: The commit message clearly states this is about complying with the MS-CIFS specification requirement that "The client MUST set this field to be equal to the SessionKey field in the SMB_COM_NEGOTIATE Response." The Linux client was incorrectly setting this to zero.
  2. **No Security Impact**: The commit message explicitly notes that this incorrect behavior has been working fine against Windows NT SMB servers because "Windows NT Server ignores the client's SessionKey" according to MS-CIFS product behavior note <94>.
  3. **Not a Cryptographic Key**: Despite the name "SessionKey", this field in the SMB1 negotiate response/session setup request is NOT the actual cryptographic session key used for authentication or encryption. It's just a session identifier that the server provides in the negotiate response and expects to see echoed back in the session setup request.
  4. **Type Correction Only**: Part of the change is just correcting the data type from `__u32` to `__le32` to properly handle endianness, which is a correctness fix rather than a security fix.
  5. **No Exploitation Vector**: There's no indication that the previous behavior (sending zero) could be exploited for any security purpose. The server either ignores it (Windows NT) or might reject the connection for non-compliance, but there's no security vulnerability.
  This is a pure protocol compliance fix to make the Linux SMB client properly conform to the MS-CIFS specification, with no security implications.
