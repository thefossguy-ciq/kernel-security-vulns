Subject: CVE-2022-50083: ext4: add EXT4_INODE_HAS_XATTR_SPACE macro in xattr.h

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add EXT4_INODE_HAS_XATTR_SPACE macro in xattr.h

When adding an xattr to an inode, we must ensure that the inode_size is
not less than EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE + extra_isize + pad. Otherwise,
the end position may be greater than the start position, resulting in UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-50083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
