Subject: CVE-2025-39867: netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: fix null deref for empty set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: fix null deref for empty set

Blamed commit broke the check for a null scratch map:
  -  if (unlikely(!m || !*raw_cpu_ptr(m->scratch)))
  +  if (unlikely(!raw_cpu_ptr(m->scratch)))

This should have been "if (!*raw_ ...)".
Use the pattern of the avx2 version which is more readable.

This can only be reproduced if avx2 support isn't available.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-39867 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
