Subject: CVE-2025-40128: btrfs: fix symbolic link reading when bs > ps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix symbolic link reading when bs > ps

[BUG DURING BS > PS TEST]
When running the following script on a btrfs whose block size is larger
than page size, e.g. 8K block size and 4K page size, it will trigger a
kernel BUG:

  # mkfs.btrfs -s 8k $dev
  # mount $dev $mnt
  # mkdir $mnt/dir
  # ln -s dir $mnt/link
  # ls $mnt/link

The call trace looks like this:

  BTRFS warning (device dm-2): support for block size 8192 with page size 4096 is experimental, some features may be missing
  BTRFS info (device dm-2): checking UUID tree
  BTRFS info (device dm-2): enabling ssd optimizations
  BTRFS info (device dm-2): enabling free space tree

Please note bs > ps support is still under development and the
enablement patch is not even in btrfs development branch.

[CAUSE]
Btrfs reuses its data folio read path to handle symbolic links, as the
symbolic link target is stored as an inline data extent.

But for newly created inodes, btrfs only set the minimal order if the
target inode is a regular file.

Thus for above newly created symbolic link, it doesn't properly respect
the minimal folio order, and triggered the above crash.

[FIX]
Call btrfs_set_inode_mapping_order() unconditionally inside
btrfs_create_new_inode().

For symbolic links this will fix the crash as now the folio will meet
the minimal order.

For regular files this brings no change.

For directory/bdev/char and all the other types of inodes, they won't
go through the data read path, thus no effect either.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-40128 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
