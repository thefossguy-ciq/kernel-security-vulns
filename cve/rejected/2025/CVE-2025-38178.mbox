Subject: CVE-2025-38178: EDAC/igen6: Fix NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/igen6: Fix NULL pointer dereference

A kernel panic was reported with the following kernel log:

  EDAC igen6: Expected 2 mcs, but only 1 detected.
  BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 000000000000d570
  ...
  Hardware name: Notebook V54x_6x_TU/V54x_6x_TU, BIOS Dasharo (coreboot+UEFI) v0.9.0 07/17/2024
  RIP: e030:ecclog_handler+0x7e/0xf0 [igen6_edac]
  ...
  igen6_probe+0x2a0/0x343 [igen6_edac]
  ...
  igen6_init+0xc5/0xff0 [igen6_edac]
  ...

This issue occurred because one memory controller was disabled by
the BIOS but the igen6_edac driver still checked all the memory
controllers, including this absent one, to identify the source of
the error. Accessing the null MMIO for the absent memory controller
resulted in the oops above.

Fix this issue by reverting the configuration structure to non-const
and updating the field 'res_cfg->num_imc' to reflect the number of
detected memory controllers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-38178 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
