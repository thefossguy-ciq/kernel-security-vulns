Subject: CVE-2023-54029: wifi: iwlwifi: fix iwl_mvm_max_amsdu_size() for MLO

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix iwl_mvm_max_amsdu_size() for MLO

For MLO, we cannot use vif->bss_conf.chandef.chan->band, since
that will lead to a NULL-ptr dereference as bss_conf isn't used.
However, in case of real MLO, we also need to take both LMACs
into account if they exist, since the station might be active
on both LMACs at the same time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-54029 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
