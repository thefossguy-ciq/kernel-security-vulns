Subject: CVE-2023-53701: netfilter: nf_tables: deactivate anonymous set from preparation phase

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: deactivate anonymous set from preparation phase

[ backport for 4.14 of c1592a89942e9678f7d9c8030efa777c0d57edab ]

Toggle deleted anonymous sets as inactive in the next generation, so
users cannot perform any update on it. Clear the generation bitmask
in case the transaction is aborted.

The following KASAN splat shows a set element deletion for a bound
anonymous set that has been already removed in the same transaction.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
