Subject: CVE-2023-53001: drm/drm_vma_manager: Add drm_vma_node_allow_once()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/drm_vma_manager: Add drm_vma_node_allow_once()

Currently there is no easy way for a drm driver to safely check and allow
drm_vma_offset_node for a drm file just once. Allow drm drivers to call
non-refcounted version of drm_vma_node_allow() so that a driver doesn't
need to keep track of each drm_vma_node_allow() to call subsequent
drm_vma_node_revoke() to prevent memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-53001 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.9 with commit 67444f8ca31cdaf45e0b761241ad49b1ae04bcf9
	Fixed in 6.2 with commit 899d3a3c19ac0e5da013ce34833dccb97d19b5e4

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2023-53001
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_vma_manager.c
	include/drm/drm_vma_manager.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67444f8ca31cdaf45e0b761241ad49b1ae04bcf9
